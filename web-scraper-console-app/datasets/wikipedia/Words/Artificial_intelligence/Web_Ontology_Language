owl is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object oriented programming but there are several critical differences class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly perhaps with monthly revisions whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly similarly ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases 91 1 93 the owl languages are characterized by formal semantics they are built upon the world wide web consortium s w3c standard for objects called the resource description framework rdf 91 2 93 owl and rdf have attracted significant academic medical and commercial interest in october 2007 91 3 93 a new w3c working group 91 4 93 was started to extend owl with several new features as proposed in the owl 1 1 member submission 91 5 93 w3c announced the new version of owl on 27 october 2009 91 6 93 this new version called owl 2 soon found its way into semantic editors such as prot g and semantic reasoners such as pellet 91 7 93 racerpro 91 8 93 fact 91 9 93 91 10 93 and hermit 91 11 93 the owl family contains many species serializations syntaxes and specifications with similar names owl and owl2 are used to refer to the 2004 and 2009 specifications respectively full species names will be used including specification version for example owl2 el when referring

further reading history edit early ontology languages edit further information knowledge representation and reasoning 160 history there is a long history of ontological development in philosophy and computer science since the 1990s a number of research efforts have explored how the idea of knowledge representation kr from artificial intelligence ai could be made useful on the world wide web these included languages based on html called shoe based on xml called xol later oil and various frame based kr languages and knowledge acquisition approaches ontology languages for the web edit in 2000 in the united states darpa started development of daml led by james hendler 91 15 93 91 self published source 93 in march 2001 the joint eu us committee on agent markup languages decided that daml should be merged with oil 91 15 93 the eu us ad hoc joint working group on agent markup languages was convened to develop daml oil as a web ontology language this group was jointly funded by the darpa under the daml program and the european union s information society technologies ist funding project daml oil was intended to be a thin layer above rdfs 91 15 93 with formal semantics based on a description logic dl 91 16 93 daml oil is a particularly major influence on owl owl s design was specifically based on daml oil 91 17 93 semantic web standards edit further information semantic web the semantic web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application enterprise and community boundaries 8201 world wide web consortium w3c semantic web activity 91 18 93 rdf schema edit further information rdfs a declarative representation language influenced by ideas from knowledge representation 8201 world wide web consortium metadata activity 91 19 93 in the late 1990s the world wide web consortium w3c metadata activity started work on rdf schema rdfs a language for rdf vocabulary sharing the rdf became a w3c recommendation in february 1999 and rdfs a candidate recommendation in march 2000 91 19 93 in february 2001 the semantic web activity replaced the metadata activity 91 19 93 in 2004 as part of a wider revision of rdf rdfs became a w3c recommendation 91 20 93 though rdfs provides some support for ontology specification the need for a more expressive ontology language had become clear 91 21 93 91 self published source 93 web ontology working group edit as of monday the 31st of may our working group will officially come to an end we have achieved all that we were chartered to do and i believe our work is being quite well appreciated 8201 james hendler and guus schreiber web ontology working group conclusions and future work 91 22 93 the world wide web consortium w3c created the web ontology working group as part of their semantic web activity it began work on november 1 2001 with co chairs james hendler and guus schreiber 91 22 93 the first working drafts of the abstract syntax reference and synopsis were published in july 2002 91 22 93 owl became a formal w3c recommendation on february 10 2004 and the working group was disbanded on may 31 2004 91 22 93 owl working group edit in 2005 at the owl experiences and directions workshop a consensus formed that recent advances in description logic would allow a more expressive revision to satisfy user requirements more comprehensively whilst retaining good computational properties in december 2006 the owl1 1 member submission 91 23 93 was made to the w3c the w3c chartered the owl working group as part of the semantic web activity in september 2007 in april 2008 this group decided to call this new language owl2 indicating a substantial revision 91 24 93 owl 2 became a w3c recommendation in october 2009 owl 2 introduces profiles to improve scalability in typical applications 91 6 93 acronym edit why not be inconsistent in at least one aspect of a language which is all about consistency 8201 guus schreiber why owl and not wol 91 25 93 owl was chosen as an easily pronounced acronym that would yield good logos suggest wisdom and honor william a martin s one world language knowledge representation project from the 1970s 91 26 93 91 27 93 91 28 93 adoption edit a 2006 survey of ontologies available on the web collected 688 owl ontologies of these 199 were owl lite 149 were owl dl and 337 owl full by syntax they found that 19 ontologies had in excess of 2 000 classes and that 6 had more than 10 000 the same survey collected 587 rdfs vocabularies 91 29 93 in 2021 prof ian horrocks was awarded the lovelace medal in recognition of his work towards the standardization of owl 91 30 93 which is considered the leading reason for its widespread adoption the result of this research and development was rdfox 91 31 93 a knowledge graph and reasoning engine the significance of this lies in the cultural shift of the technology space leaving behind the dismissive attitude towards reasoning technology s inability to perform at speed as rdfox proved beyond a doubt that high speed reasoning was not only possible but commercially viable many institutions have now adopted this technology as a solution to social and industrial problems involving highly interconnected data ontologies edit main article ontology information science an ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization 8201 tom gruber a translation approach to portable ontology specifications 91 32 93 the data described by an ontology in the owl family is interpreted as a set of individuals and a set of property assertions which relate these individuals to each other an ontology consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets of individuals called classes and the types of relationships permitted between them these axioms provide semantics by allowing systems to infer additional information based on the data explicitly provided a full introduction to the expressive power of the owl is provided in the w3c s owl guide 91 33 93 owl ontologies can import other ontologies adding information from the imported ontology to the current ontology 91 17 93 example edit an ontology describing families might include axioms stating that a hasmother property is only present between two individuals when hasparent is also present and that individuals of class hastypeoblood are never related via hasparent to members of the hastypeabblood class if it is stated that the individual harriet is related via hasmother to the individual sue and that harriet is a member of the hastypeoblood class then it can be inferred that sue is not a member of hastypeabblood this is however only true if the concepts of parent and mother only mean biological parent or mother and not social parent or mother species edit owl dialects edit the w3c endorsed owl specification includes the definition of three variants of owl with different levels of expressiveness these are owl lite owl dl and owl full ordered by increasing expressiveness each of these sublanguages is a syntactic extension of its simpler predecessor the following set of relations hold their inverses do not every legal owl lite ontology is a legal owl dl ontology every legal owl dl ontology is a legal owl full ontology every valid owl lite conclusion is a valid owl dl conclusion every valid owl dl conclusion is a valid owl full conclusion owl lite edit owl lite was originally intended to support those users primarily needing a classification hierarchy and simple constraints for example while it supports cardinality constraints it only permits cardinality values of 0 or 1 it was hoped that it would be simpler to provide tool support for owl lite than its more expressive relatives allowing quick migration path for systems using thesauri and other taxonomies in practice however most of the expressiveness constraints placed on owl lite amount to little more than syntactic inconveniences most of the constructs available in owl dl can be built using complex combinations of owl lite features and is equally expressive as the description logic s h i f d displaystyle mathcal shif mathbf d 91 24 93 development of owl lite tools has thus proven to be almost as difficult as development of tools for owl dl and owl lite is not widely used 91 24 93 owl dl edit owl dl is designed to provide the maximum expressiveness possible while retaining computational completeness either or holds decidability there is an effective procedure to determine whether is derivable or not and the availability of practical reasoning algorithms owl dl includes all owl language constructs but they can be used only under certain restrictions for example number restrictions may not be placed upon properties which are declared to be transitive and while a class may be a subclass of many classes a class cannot be an instance of another class owl dl is so named due to its correspondence with description logic a field of research that has studied the logics that form the formal foundation of owl owl full edit owl full is based on a different semantics from owl lite or owl dl and was designed to preserve some compatibility with rdf schema for example in owl full a class can be treated simultaneously as a collection of individuals and as an individual in its own right this is not permitted in owl dl owl full allows an ontology to augment the meaning of the pre defined rdf or owl vocabulary owl full is undecidable so no reasoning software is able to perform complete reasoning for it owl2 profiles edit in owl 2 there are three sublanguages of the language owl 2 el is a fragment that has polynomial time reasoning complexity owl 2 ql is designed to enable easier access and query to data stored in databases owl 2 rl is a rule subset of owl 2 syntax edit the owl family of languages supports a variety of syntaxes it is useful to distinguish high level syntaxes aimed at specification from exchange syntaxes more suitable for general use high level edit these are close to the ontology structure of languages in the owl family owl abstract syntax edit high level syntax is used to specify the owl ontology structure and semantics 91 34 93 the owl abstract syntax presents an ontology as a sequence of annotations axioms and facts annotations carry machine and human oriented meta data information about the classes properties and individuals that compose the ontology is contained in axioms and facts only each class property and individual is either anonymous or identified by an uri reference facts state data either about an individual or about a pair of individual identifiers that the objects identified are distinct or the same axioms specify the characteristics of classes and properties this style is similar to frame languages and quite dissimilar to well known syntaxes for dls and resource description framework rdf 91 34 93 sean bechhofer et al argue that though this syntax is hard to parse it is quite concrete they conclude that the name abstract syntax may be somewhat misleading 91 35 93 owl2 functional syntax edit this syntax closely follows the structure of an owl2 ontology it is used by owl2 to specify semantics mappings to exchange syntaxes and profiles 91 36 93 exchange syntaxes edit owl rdf xml serializationfilename extension owx owl rdfinternet media 160 type application owl xml application rdf xml 91 37 93 developed

yes rdf syntaxes edit syntactic mappings into rdf are specified 91 34 93 91 38 93 for languages in the owl family several rdf serialization formats have been devised each leads to a syntax for languages in the owl family through this mapping rdf xml is normative 91 34 93 91 38 93 owl2 xml syntax edit owl2 specifies an xml serialization that closely models the structure of an owl2 ontology 91 39 93 manchester syntax edit the manchester syntax is a compact human readable syntax with a style close to frame languages variations are available for owl and owl2 not all owl and owl2 ontologies can be expressed in this syntax 91 40 93 examples edit the w3c owl 2 web ontology language provides syntax examples 91 41 93 tea ontology edit consider an ontology for tea based on a tea class first an ontology identifier is needed every owl ontology must be identified by a uri http www example org tea owl say this example provides a sense of the syntax to save space below preambles and prefix

properties to dl roles while individuals are called the same way in both the owl and the dl terminology 91 42 93 in the beginning is a was quite simple today however there are almost as many meanings for this inheritance link as there are knowledge representation systems 8201 ronald j brachman what is a is and isn t 91 43 93 early attempts to build large ontologies were plagued by a lack of clear definitions members of the owl family have model theoretic formal semantics and so have strong logical foundations description logics are a family of logics that are decidable fragments of first order logic with attractive and well understood computational properties owl dl and owl lite semantics are based on dls 91 44 93 they combine a syntax for describing and exchanging ontologies and formal semantics that gives them meaning for example owl dl corresponds to the s h o i n d displaystyle mathcal shoin mathcal d description logic while owl 2 corresponds to the s r o i q d displaystyle mathcal sroiq mathcal d logic 91 45 93 sound complete terminating reasoners i e systems which are guaranteed to derive every consequence of the knowledge in an ontology exist for these dls relation to rdfs edit owl full is intended to be compatible with rdf schema rdfs and to be capable of augmenting the meanings of existing resource description framework rdf vocabulary 91 46 93 a model theory describes the formal semantics for rdf 91 47 93 this interpretation provides the meaning of rdf and rdfs vocabulary so the meaning of owl full ontologies are defined by extension of the rdfs meaning and owl full is a semantic extension of rdf 91 48 93 open world assumption edit the closed world assumption implies that everything we don t know is false while the open world assumption states that everything we don t know is undefined 8201 stefano mazzocchi closed world vs open world the first semantic web battle 91 49 93 the languages in the owl family use the open world assumption under the open world assumption if a statement cannot be proven to be true with current knowledge we cannot draw the conclusion that the statement is false contrast to other languages edit a relational database consists of sets of tuples with the same attributes sql is a query and management language for relational databases prolog is a logical programming language both use the closed world assumption terminology edit languages in the owl family are capable of creating classes properties defining instances and its operations instances edit an instance is an object it corresponds to a description logic individual classes edit a class is a collection of objects a class may contain individuals instances of the class a class may have any number of instances an instance may belong to none one or more classes a class may be a subclass of another inheriting characteristics from its parent superclass this corresponds to logical subsumption and dl concept inclusion notated x2291 displaystyle sqsubseteq all classes are subclasses of owl thing dl top notated x22a4 displaystyle top the root class all classes are subclassed by owl nothing dl bottom notated x22a5 displaystyle bot the empty class no instances are members of owl nothing modelers use owl thing and owl nothing to assert facts about all or no instances 91 50 93 91 self published source 93 class and their members can be defined in owl either by extension or by intension an individual can be explicitly assigned a class by a class assertion for example we can add a statement queen elizabeth is a n instance of human or by a class expression with classexpression statements every instance of the human class who has a female value to the sex property is an instance of the woman class example edit let s call human the class of all humans in the world is a subclass of owl thing the class of all women say woman in the world is a subclass of human then we have owl nothing x2291 woman x2291 human x2291 owl thing displaystyle textsf owl nothing sqsubseteq textsf woman sqsubseteq textsf human sqsubseteq textsf owl thing the membership of some individual to a class could be noted classassertion human george washington and class inclusion subclassof woman human the first means george washington is a human and the second every woman is human properties edit a property is a characteristic of a class a directed binary relation that specifies some attribute which is true for instances of that class properties sometimes act as data values or links to other instances properties may exhibit logical features for example by being transitive symmetric inverse and functional properties may also have domains and ranges datatype properties edit datatype properties are relations between instances of classes and rdf literals or xml schema datatypes for example modelname string datatype is the property of manufacturer class they are formulated using owl datatypeproperty type object properties edit object properties are relations between instances of two classes for example ownedby may be an object type property of the vehicle class and may have a range which is the class person they are formulated using owl objectproperty operators edit languages in the owl family support various operations on classes such as union intersection and complement they also allow class enumeration cardinality disjointness and equivalence metaclasses edit metaclasses are classes of classes they are allowed in owl full or with a feature called class instance punning public ontologies edit

relate more than 2 individuals or to relate an individual to a list this cannot be done within owl they may need to adopt a pattern instead which encodes the meaning outside the formal semantics 91 61
