1996 as a research project by larry page and sergey brin when they were both phd students at stanford university in california 91 20 93 91 21 93 91 22 93 the project initially involved an unofficial third founder scott hassan the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original google search engine but he left before google was officially founded as a company 91 23 93 91 24 93 hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company willow garage in 2006 91 25 93 91 26 93 while conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites 91 27 93 they called this algorithm pagerank it determined a website s relevance by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site 91 28 93 91 29 93 page told his ideas to hassan who began writing the code to implement page s ideas 91 23 93 page and brin originally nicknamed the new search engine backrub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site 91 20 93 91 30 93 91 31 93 hassan as well as alan steremberg were cited by page and brin as being critical to the development of google rajeev motwani and terry winograd later co authored with page and brin the first paper about the project describing pagerank and the initial prototype of the google search engine published in 1998 h ctor garc a molina and jeff ullman were also cited as contributors to the project 91 32 93 pagerank was influenced by a similar page ranking and site scoring algorithm earlier used for rankdex developed by robin li in 1996 with larry page s pagerank patent including a citation to li s earlier rankdex patent li later went on to create the chinese search engine baidu 91 33 93 91 34 93 eventually they changed the name to google the name of the search engine was a play on the word googol 91 20 93 91 35 93 91 36 93 a very large number written 10100 1 followed by 100 zeros picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information 91 37 93 google s original homepage had a simple design because the company founders had little experience in html the markup language used for designing web pages 91 38 93 the domain name www google com was registered on september 15 1997 91 39 93 and the company was incorporated on september 4 1998 it was based in the garage of susan wojcicki 91 22 93 in menlo park california craig silverstein a fellow phd student at stanford was hired

september 7 1998 the day google was officially incorporated this initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds 91 42 93 91 43 93 page and brin initially approached david cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in stanford and they knew he had startup experience having recently sold the company he co founded granite systems to cisco for 220 million david arranged a meeting page and brin and his granite co founder andy bechtolsheim the meeting was set for 8 am at the front porch of david s home in palo alto and it had to be brief because andy had another meeting at cisco where he now worked after the acquisition at 9 am andy briefly tested a demo of the website liked what he saw and then went back to his car to grab the check david cheriton later also joined in with an 250 000 investment 91 44 93 91 45 93 google received money from two other angel investors in 1998 amazon com founder jeff bezos and entrepreneur ram shriram 91 46 93 page and brin had first approached shriram who was a venture capitalist for funding and counsel and shriram invested 250 000 in google in february 1998 shriram knew bezos because amazon had acquired junglee at which shriram was the president it was shriram who told bezos about google bezos asked shriram to meet google s founders and they met 6 months after shriram had made his investment when bezos and his wife were in a vacation trip to the bay area google s initial funding round had already formally closed but bezos status as ceo of amazon was enough to persuade page and brin to extend the round and accept his investment 91 47 93 91 48 93 between these initial investors friends and family google raised around 1 000 000 which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in menlo park california 91 49 93 after some additional small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999 91 46 93 a new 25 million round of funding was announced on june 7 1999 91

chairman and ceo of google 91 49 93 eric was proposed by john doerr from kleiner perkins he had been trying to find a ceo that sergey and larry would accept for several months but they rejected

investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive office which had been made verbally during investment negotiations eric wasn t initially enthusiastic about joining google
