programming languages glossary glossary vte general game playing ggp is the design of artificial intelligence programs to be able to play more than one game successfully 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 for many games like chess computers are programmed to play these games using a specially designed algorithm which cannot be transferred to another context for instance a chess playing computer program cannot play checkers general game playing is considered as a necessary milestone on the way to artificial general intelligence 91 4 93 general video game playing gvgp is the concept of ggp adjusted to the purpose of playing video games for video games game rules have to be either learnt over multiple iterations by artificial players like td gammon 91 5 93 or are predefined manually in a domain specific language and sent in advance to artificial players 91 6 93 91 7 93 like in traditional ggp starting in 2013 significant progress was made following the deep reinforcement learning approach including the development of programs that can learn to play atari 2600 games 91 8 93 91 5 93 91 9 93 91 10 93 91 11 93 as well as a program that can learn to play nintendo entertainment system games 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 the first commercial usage of general game playing technology was zillions of games in 1998 general game playing was also proposed for trading agents in supply chain management thereunder price negotiation in online auctions from 2003 on 91 15 93 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 contents 1 history 2 ggp implementations 2 1 stanford project 2 2 other approaches 3 gvgp

please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information october 2021 in 1992 barney pell defined the concept of meta game playing and developed the metagame system this was the first program to automatically generate game rules of chess like games and one of the earliest programs to use automated game generation pell then developed the system metagamer 91 19 93 this system was able to play a number of chess like games given game rules definition in a special language called game description language gdl without any human interaction once the games were generated 91 20 93 in 1998 the commercial system zillions of games was developed by jeff mallett and mark lefler the system used a lisp like language to define the game rules zillions of games derived the evaluation function automatically from the game rules based on piece mobility board structure and game goals it also employed usual algorithms as found in computer chess systems alpha beta pruning with move ordering transposition tables etc 91 21 93 the package was extended in 2007 by the addition of the axiom plug in an alternate metagame engine that incorporates a complete forth based programming language in 1998 z tree was developed by urs fischbacher 91 22 93 z tree is the first and the most cited software tool for experimental economics z tree allows the definition of game rules in z tree language for game theoretic experiments with human subjects it also allows definition of computer players which participate in a play with human subjects 91 23 93 in 2005 the stanford project general game playing was established 91 3 93 in 2012 the development of pyvgdl started 91 24 93 ggp implementations edit stanford project edit general game playing is a project of the stanford logic group of stanford university california which aims to create a platform for general game playing it is the most well known effort at standardizing ggp ai and generally seen as the standard for ggp systems the games are defined by sets of rules represented in the game description language in order to play the games players interact with a game hosting server 91 25 93 91 26 93 that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes since 2005 there have been annual general game playing competitions at the aaai conference the competition judges competitor ai s abilities to play a variety of different games by recording their performance on each individual game in the first stage of the competition entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves gain the upper hand and complete games faster in the following runoff round the ais face off against each other in increasingly complex games the ai that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition and until 2013 its creator used to win a 10 000 prize 91 19 93 so far the following programs were victorious 91 27 93 year name developer institution ref 2005 cluneplayer jim clune ucla

piette artois university other approaches edit there are other general game playing systems which use their own languages for defining the game rules other general game playing software include system

university as part of the erc funded digital ludeme project 91 37 93 91 38 93 91 39 93 gvgp implementations edit reinforcement learning edit gvgp could potentially be used to create real video game ai automatically as well as to test game environments including those created automatically using procedural content generation and to find potential loopholes in the gameplay that a human player could exploit 91 7 93 gvgp has also been used to generate game rules and estimate a game s quality based on relative algorithm performance profiles rapp which compare the skill differentiation that a game allows between good ai and bad ai 91 40 93 video game description language edit the general video game ai competition gvgai has been running since 2014 in this competition two dimensional video games similar to and sometimes based on 1980s era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the ggp competition it has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms the competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the video game description language vgdl which should not be confused with gdl and is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed one example for vgdl is pyvgdl developed in 2013 91 6 93 91 24 93 the games used in gvgp are for now often 2 dimensional arcade games as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify 91 41 93 to simplify the process of creating an ai that can interpret video games games for this purpose are written in vgdl manually vgdl can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels using answer set programming asp and an evolutionary algorithm ea gvgp can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed 91 42 93 algorithms edit since ggp ai must be designed to play multiple games its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games instead the ai must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games the ai must also be an ongoing process that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states for this reason open loop techniques are often most effective 91 43 93 a popular method for developing ggp ai is the monte carlo tree search mcts algorithm 91 44 93 often used together with the uct method upper confidence bound applied to trees variations of mcts have been proposed to better play certain games as well as to make it compatible with video game playing 91 45 93 91 46 93 91 47 93 another variation of tree search algorithms used is the directed breadth first search dbs 91 48 93 in which a child node to the current state is created for each available action and visits each child ordered by highest average reward until either the game ends or runs out of time 91 49 93 in each tree search method the ai simulates potential actions and ranks each based on the average highest reward of each path in terms of points earned 91 44 93 91 49 93 assumptions edit in order to interact with games algorithms must operate under the assumption that games all share common characteristics in the book half real video games between real worlds and fictional worlds jesper juul gives the following definition of games games are based on rules they have variable outcomes different outcomes give different values player effort influences outcomes the player is attached to the outcomes and the game has negotiable consequences 91 50 93 using these assumptions game playing ai can be created by quantifying the player input the game outcomes and how the various rules apply and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path 91 41 93 see also edit alphazero muzero artificial general intelligence artificial intelligence in video games domain specific entertainment
