creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge 91 1 93 it involves the collection organization and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error these activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases a research project may be an expansion on past work in the field to test the validity of instruments procedures or experiments research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole 91 2 93 the primary purposes of basic research as opposed to applied research are documentation discovery interpretation and the research and development r amp d of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge approaches to research

figures in the development of the scientific method 91 3 93 the word research is derived from the middle french recherche which means to go about seeking the term itself being derived from the old french term recerchier a compound word from re cerchier or sercher meaning search 91 4 93 the earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577 91 4 93 definitions edit research has been defined in a number of different ways and while there are similarities there does not appear to be a single all encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it research in simplest terms is searching for knowledge and searching for truth in formal sense it is a systematic study of a problem attacked by a deliberately chosen strategy which starts with choosing an approach to preparing blue print design acting upon it in terms of designing research hypotheses choosing methods and techniques selecting or developing data collection tools processing the data interpretation and ends with presenting solution s of the problem 91 5 93 another definition of research is given by john w creswell who states that research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue it consists of three steps pose a question collect data to answer the question and present an answer to the question 91 6 93 the merriam webster online dictionary defines research in more detail as studious inquiry or examination especially 160 investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws 91 4 93 forms of research edit original research edit original research redirects here for the wikipedia prohibition against user generated unpublished research see wikipedia no original research original research also called primary research is research that is not exclusively based on a summary review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research this material is of a primary source character the purpose of the original research is to produce new knowledge rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form e g summarized or classified 91 7 93 91 8 93 original research can be in various forms depending on the discipline it pertains to in experimental work it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject s e g in the laboratory or in the field documents the methodology results and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments or offers a novel interpretation of previous results in analytical work there are typically some new for example mathematical results produced or a new way of approaching an existing problem in some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the researcher 91 9 93 the degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in academic journals and usually established by means of peer review 91 10 93 graduate students are commonly required to perform original research as part of a dissertation 91 11 93 scientific research edit main article scientific method this article

idaho national laboratory scientific research equipment at mit german maritime research vessel sonne scientific research is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing curiosity this research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world it makes practical applications possible scientific research is funded by public authorities by charitable organizations and by private groups including many companies scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching these do not necessarily correlate 91 12 93 generally research is understood to follow a certain structural process though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher the following steps are usually part of most formal research both basic and applied observations and formation of the topic consists of the subject area of one s interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research the subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow a keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable the research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic hypothesis a testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables conceptual definition description of a concept by relating it to other concepts operational definition details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured assessed in the study gathering of data consists of identifying a population and selecting samples gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments the instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable analysis of data involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it data interpretation this can be represented through tables figures and pictures and then described in words test revising of hypothesis conclusion reiteration if necessary a common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven see rather null hypothesis generally a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment if the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis then the hypothesis is rejected see falsifiability however if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis the experiment is said to support the hypothesis this careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations in this sense a hypothesis can never be proven but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and eventually becoming widely thought of as true a useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time the prediction will be verified as the accuracy of observation improves with time the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction in this case a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old the new will supplant it researchers can also use a null hypothesis which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables research in the humanities edit research in the humanities involves different methods such as for example hermeneutics and semiotics humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question but instead explore the issues and details that surround it context is always important and context can be social historical political cultural or ethnic an example of research in the humanities is historical research which is embodied in historical method historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these these studies may be qualitative or quantitative and can use a variety of approaches such as queer theory or feminist theory 91 13 93 artistic research edit artistic research also seen as practice based research can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself it is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth the controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines 91 14 93 one of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods as such it is similar to the social sciences in using qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis 91 15 93 artistic research has been defined by the school of dance and circus dans och cirkush gskolan doch stockholm in the following manner artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines it is based on artistic practices methods and criticality through presented documentation the insights gained shall be placed in a context 91 16 93 artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts 91 17 93 a simpler understanding by julian klein defines artistic research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception 91 18 93 for a survey of the central problematics of today s artistic research see giaco schiesser 91 19 93 according to artist hakan topal in artistic research perhaps more so than other disciplines intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities 91 20 93 most writers whether of fiction or non fiction books also have to do research to support their creative work this may be factual historical or background research background research could include for example geographical or procedural research 91 21 93 the society for artistic research sar publishes the triannual journal for artistic research jar 91 22 93 91 23 93 an international online open access and peer reviewed journal for the identification publication and dissemination of artistic research and its methodologies from all arts disciplines and it runs the research catalogue rc 91 24 93 91 25 93 91 26 93 a searchable documentary database of artistic research to which anyone can contribute patricia leavy addresses eight arts based research abr genres narrative inquiry fiction based research poetry music dance theatre film and visual art 91 27 93 in 2016 the european league of institutes of the arts launched the florence principles on the doctorate in the arts 91 28 93 the florence principles relating to the salzburg principles and the salzburg recommendations of the european university association name seven points of attention to specify the doctorate phd in the arts compared to a scientific doctorate phd the florence principles have been endorsed and are supported also by aec cilect cumulus and sar historical research edit main article historical method german historian leopold von ranke 1795 1886 considered to be one of the founders of modern source based history the historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history there are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work under the headings of external criticism internal criticism and synthesis this includes lower criticism and sensual criticism though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher the following concepts are part of most formal historical research 91 29 93 identification of origin date evidence of localization recognition of authorship analysis of data identification of integrity attribution of credibility documentary research edit main article documentary research steps in conducting research edit research design and evidence research cycle research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research 91 30 93 the hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research focusing in on the required information through the method of the project like the neck of the hourglass then expands the research in the form of discussion and results the major steps in conducting research are 91 31 93 identification of research problem literature review specifying the purpose of research determining specific research questions specification of a conceptual framework sometimes including a set of hypotheses 91 32 93 choice of a methodology for data collection data collection verifying data analyzing and interpreting the data reporting and evaluating research communicating the research findings and possibly recommendations the steps generally represent the overall process however they should be viewed as an ever changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps 91 33 93 most research begins with a general statement of the problem or rather the purpose for engaging in the study 91 34 93 the literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study often a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified a gap in the current literature as identified by a researcher then engenders a research question the research question may be parallel to the hypothesis the hypothesis is the supposition to be tested the researcher s collects data to test the hypothesis the researcher s then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods engaging in what is known as empirical research the results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated at the end the researcher may discuss avenues for further research however some researchers advocate for the reverse approach starting with articulating findings and discussion of them moving up to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review the reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry research questions research method relevant research literature and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted rudolph rummel says no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive it is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data researchers and methods can one have confidence in the results 91 35 93 plato in meno talks about an inherent difficulty if not a paradox of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way if you know what you re searching for why do you search for it i e you have already found it if you don t know what you re searching for what are you searching for 91 36 93 research methods edit the research room at the new york public library an example of secondary research in progress maurice hilleman the preeminent vaccinologist of the 20th century is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist in that time 91 37 93 the goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue this process takes three main forms although as previously discussed the boundaries between them may be obscure exploratory research which helps to identify and define a problem or question constructive research which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question empirical research which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence there are two major types of empirical research design qualitative research and quantitative research researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer qualitative research qualitative research refers to much more subjective non quantitative use different methods of collecting data analyzing data interpreting data for meanings definitions characteristics symbols metaphors of things qualitative research further classified into following types ethnography this research mainly focus on culture of group of people which includes share attributes language practices structure value norms and material things evaluate human lifestyle ethno people grapho to write this disciple may include ethnic groups ethno genesis composition resettlement and social welfare characteristics phenomenology it is very powerful strategy for demonstrating methodology to health professions education as well as best suited for exploring challenging problems in health professions educations 91 38 93 quantitative research this involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing statistical methods the quantitative research designs are experimental correlational and survey or descriptive 91 39 93 statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of positivism the quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories 91 citation needed 93 these methods produce results that can be summarized compared and generalized to larger populations if the data are collected using proper sampling and data collection strategies 91 40 93 quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest 91 40 93 if the research question is about people participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment 91 citation needed 93 if this is not feasible the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent or outcome variable if the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants 91 41 93 in either qualitative or quantitative research the researcher s may collect primary or secondary data 91 40 93 primary data is data collected specifically for the research such as through interviews or questionnaires secondary data is data that already exists such as census data which can be re used for the research it is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible 91 42 93 mixed method research i e research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements using both primary and secondary data is becoming more common 91 43 93 this method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer for example a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights 91 44 93 big data has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection furthermore methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed types of research method 1 observatory research method 2 correlation research method 91 45 93 non empirical research non empirical theoretical research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation as such non empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source this however does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge non empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained then theoretical research tries to explain them and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses these hypotheses are then tested empirically giving more observations that may need further explanation and so on see scientific method a simple example of a non empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature mathematics research does not rely on externally available data rather it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects research ethics edit see also bioethics medical ethics and responsible research and innovation research ethics is concerned with the moral issues that arise during or as a result of research activities as well as the conduct of individual researchers and the implications for research communities 91 46 93 historically scandals such as nazi human experimentation and the tuskegee syphilis experiment led to the realisation that clear measures are needed for the ethical governance of research to ensure that people animals and environments are not unduly harmed by scientific inquiry the management of research ethics is inconsistent across countries and there is no universally accepted approach to how it should be addressed 91 47 93 91 48 93 91 49 93 research ethics committees institutional review board in the us have emerged as one governance mechanism to ensure research is conducted responsibly when making moral judgments we may be guided by different values philosophers commonly distinguish between approaches like deontology consequentialism confucianism virtue ethics and ubuntu ethics to list a few regardless of approach the application of ethical theory to specific contexts is known as applied ethics and research ethics can be viewed as a subfield of applied ethics because ethical theory is applied in real world research scenarios ethical issues may arise in the design and implementation of research involving human experimentation or animal experimentation there may also be consequences for the environment for society or for future generations that need to be considered research ethics is most developed as a concept in medical research with typically cited codes being the 1947 nuremberg code the 1964 declaration of helsinki and the 1978 belmont report informed consent is a key concept in research ethics thanks to these codes research in other fields such as social sciences information technology biotechnology or engineering may generate different types of ethical concerns to those in medical research 91 47 93 91 48 93 91 50 93 91 51 93 91 52 93 91 53 93 in countries such as canada mandatory research ethics training is required for students professors and others who work in research 91 54 93 91 55 93 whilst the us has legislated on how institutional review boards operate since the 1974 national research act research ethics is commonly distinguished from the promotion of academic or research integrity which includes issues such as scientific misconduct e g fraud fabrication of data or plagiarism note that because of the close interaction with integrity increasingly research ethics is included as part of the broader field of responsible conduct of research rcr in north america or responsible research and innovation in europe and with government agencies such as the united states office of research integrity or the canadian interagency advisory panel on responsible conduct of research promoting or requiring interdisciplinary training for researchers problems in research edit meta research edit main article meta research meta research is the study of research through the use of research methods also known as research on research it aims to reduce waste and increase the quality of research in all fields meta research concerns itself with the detection of bias methodological flaws and other errors and inefficiencies among the finding of meta research is a low rates of reproducibility across a large number of fields this widespread difficulty in reproducing research has been termed the replication crisis 91 56 93 methods of research edit in many disciplines western methods of conducting research are predominant 91 57 93 researchers are overwhelmingly taught western methods of data collection and study the increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the scientific lacuna in culturally sensitive methods of data collection 91 58 93 western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non western societies for example hua oranga was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in m ori populations and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the m ori people taha wairua the spiritual dimension taha hinengaro the mental dimension taha tinana the physical dimension and taha whanau the family dimension 91 59 93 bias edit research is often biased in the languages that are preferred linguicism and the geographic locations where research occurs periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication as the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in english multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite western dominated journals 91 60 93 multilingual scholars influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference 91 61 93 for comparative politics western countries are over represented in single country studies with heavy emphasis on western europe canada australia and new zealand since 2000 latin american countries have become more popular in single country studies in contrast countries in oceania and the caribbean are the focus of very few studies patterns of geographic bias also show a relationship with linguicism countries whose official languages are french or arabic are far less likely to be the focus of single country studies than countries with different official languages within africa english speaking countries are more represented than other countries 91 62 93 generalizability edit see also external validity generalization is the process of more broadly applying the valid results of one study 91 63 93 studies with a narrow scope can result in a lack of generalizability meaning that the results may not be applicable to other populations or regions in comparative politics this can result from using a single country study rather than a study design that uses data from multiple countries despite the issue of generalizability single country studies have risen in prevalence since the late 2000s 91 62 93 publication peer review edit this article needs to be updated the reason given is this subsection s claims are potentially outdated in the digital age given that near total penetration of web access among scholars worldwide enables any scholar s to submit papers to any journal anywhere please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information may 2017 peer review is a form of self regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality improve performance and provide credibility in academia scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper s suitability for publication usually the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view and this is usually done free of charge the tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review 91 64 93 it was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of north america and europe because limitations on the availability of resources including high quality paper and sophisticated image rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry 91 61 93 these limitations in turn result in the under representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars research efforts and this under representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide influence of the open access movement edit the open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a public domain that of humanity 91 65 93 this idea gained prevalence as a result of western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation for instance most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships 91 65 93 there is alleged to be a double standard in the western knowledge system on the one hand digital right management used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups i e indigenous communities this is denounced as access control and reprehended as censorship 91 65 93 future perspectives edit even though western dominance seems to be prominent in research some scholars such as simon marginson argue for the need for a plural university world 91 66 93 marginson argues that the east asian confucian model could take over the western model this could be due to changes in funding for research both in the east and the west focused on emphasizing educational achievement east asian cultures mainly in china and south korea have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion 91 66 93 in contrast in the western academic world notably in the united kingdom as well as in some state governments in the united states funding cuts for university research have occurred which some 91 who 93 say may lead to the future decline of western dominance in research neo colonial approaches edit this section is an excerpt from neo colonial science edit neo colonial research or neo colonial science 91 67 93 91 68 93 frequently described as helicopter research 91 67 93 parachute science 91 69 93 91 70 93 or research 91 71 93 parasitic research 91 72 93 91 73 93 or safari study 91 74 93 is when researchers from wealthier countries go to a developing country collect information travel back to their country analyze the data and samples and publish the results with no or little involvement of local researchers a 2003 study by the hungarian academy of sciences found that 70 of articles in a random sample of publications about least developed countries did not include a local research co author 91 68 93 frequently during this kind of research the local colleagues might be used to provide logistics support as fixers but are not engaged for their expertise or given credit for their participation in the research scientific publications resulting from parachute science frequently only contribute to the career of the scientists from rich countries thus limiting the development of local science capacity such as funded research centers and the careers of local scientists 91 67 93 this form of colonial science has reverberations of 19th century scientific practices of treating non western participants as others in order to advance colonialism and critics call for the end of these extractivist practices in order to decolonize knowledge 91 75 93 91 76 93 this kind of research approach reduces the quality of research because international researchers may not ask the right questions or draw connections to local issues 91 77 93 the result of this approach is that local communities are unable to leverage the research to their own advantage 91 70 93 ultimately especially for fields dealing with global issues like conservation biology which rely on local communities to implement solutions neo colonial science prevents institutionalization of the findings in local communities in order to address issues being studied by scientists 91 70 93

first issue of nature 4 november 1869 academic publishing is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience the system varies widely by field and is also always changing if often slowly most academic work is published in journal article or book form there is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form these forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations in publishing stm publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science technology and medicine most established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields from the print to the electronic format a study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently 91 79 93 it has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings 91 80 93 business models are different in the electronic environment since about the early 1990s licensing of electronic resources particularly journals has been very common presently a major trend particularly with respect to scholarly journals is open access 91 81 93 there are two main forms of open access open access publishing in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication and self archiving where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web research funding edit main article research funding this section needs expansion 32 with funding for research in the humanities and other areas presently only scientific research is addressed you can help by adding to it april 2019 most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources corporate research and development departments private foundations and government research councils such as the national institutes of health in the usa 91 82 93 and the medical research council in the uk these are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors many senior researchers such as group leaders spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds these grants are necessary
