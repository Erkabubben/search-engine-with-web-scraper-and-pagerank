agency darpa is a research and development agency of the united states department of defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military 91 3 93 91 4 93 originally known as the advanced research projects agency arpa the agency was created on february 7 1958 by president dwight d eisenhower in response to the soviet launching of sputnik 1 in 1957 by collaborating with academia industry and government partners darpa formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science often beyond immediate u s military requirements 91 5 93 the economist has called darpa the agency that shaped the modern world and pointed out that moderna s covid 19 vaccine sits alongside weather satellites gps drones stealth technology voice interfaces the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which darpa can claim at least partial credit 91 6 93 its track record of success has inspired governments around the world to launch similar research and development agencies 91 6 93 darpa is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior department of defense management darpa comprises approximately 220 government employees in six technical offices including nearly 100 program managers who together oversee about 250 research and development programs 91 7 93 the name of the organization first changed from its founding name arpa to darpa in march 1972 changing back to arpa in february 1993 then reverted to darpa in march 1996 91 8 93 the

past 50 years early history 1958 1969 edit darpa s former headquarters in the virginia square neighborhood of arlington the agency is currently located in a new building at 675 north randolph st the creation of the advanced research projects agency arpa was authorized by president dwight d eisenhower in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements 91 5 93 the two relevant acts are the supplemental military construction authorization air force 91 11 93 public law 85 325 and department of defense directive 5105 15 in february 1958 it was placed within the office of the secretary of defense osd and counted approximately 150 people 91 12 93 its creation was directly attributed to the launching of sputnik and to u s realization that the soviet union had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology initial funding of arpa was 520 million 91 13 93 arpa s first director roy johnson left a 160 000 management job at general electric for an 18 000 job at arpa 91 14 93 herbert york from lawrence livermore national laboratory was hired as his scientific assistant 91 15 93 johnson and york were both keen on space projects but when nasa was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of arpa s funding were transferred to it johnson resigned and arpa was repurposed to do high risk high gain far out basic research a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation s scientists and research universities 91 16 93 arpa s second director was brigadier general austin w betts who resigned in early 1961 and was succeeded by jack ruina who served until 1963 91 17 93 ruina the first scientist to administer arpa managed to raise its budget to 250 million 91 18 93 it was ruina who hired j c r licklider as the first administrator of the information processing techniques office which played a vital role in creation of arpanet the basis for the future internet 91 19 93 additionally the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high level department of defense organization to formulate and execute r amp d projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the military services and their laboratories in pursuit of this mission darpa has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs from 1958 to 1965 arpa s emphasis centered on major national issues including space ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection 91 20 93 during 1960 all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the military space programs to the individual services 91 21 93 this allowed arpa to concentrate its efforts on the project defender defense against ballistic missiles project vela nuclear test detection and project agile counterinsurgency r amp d programs and to begin work on computer processing behavioral sciences and materials sciences the defender and agile programs formed the foundation of darpa sensor surveillance and directed energy r amp d particularly in the study of radar infrared sensing and x ray gamma ray detection arpa at this point 1959 played an early role in transit also called navsat a predecessor to the global positioning system gps 91 22 93 fast forward to 1959 when a joint effort between darpa and the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory began to fine tune the early explorers discoveries transit sponsored by the navy and developed under the leadership of dr richard kirschner at johns hopkins was the first satellite positioning system 91 23 93 91 24 93 during the late 1960s with the transfer of these mature programs to the services arpa redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small essentially exploratory research programs the agency was renamed the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in 1972 and during the early 1970s it emphasized direct energy programs information processing and tactical technologies 91 citation needed 93 concerning information processing darpa made great progress initially through its support of the development of time sharing all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the multics system developed by a cooperation among bell labs general electric and mit which darpa supported by funding project mac at mit with an initial two million dollar grant 91 25 93 darpa supported the evolution of the arpanet the first wide area packet switching network packet radio network packet satellite network and ultimately the internet and research in the artificial intelligence fields of speech recognition and signal processing including parts of shakey the robot 91 26 93 darpa also supported the early development of both hypertext and hypermedia darpa funded one of the first two hypertext systems douglas engelbart s nls computer system as well as the mother of all demos darpa later funded the development of the aspen movie map which is generally seen as the first hypermedia system and an important precursor of virtual reality later history 1970 1980 edit the mansfield amendment of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research through arpa darpa only to projects with direct military application the resulting brain drain is credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as xerox parc between 1976 and 1981 darpa s major projects were dominated by air land sea and space technology tactical armor and anti armor programs infrared sensing for space based surveillance high energy laser technology for space based missile defense antisubmarine warfare advanced cruise missiles advanced aircraft and defense applications of advanced computing these large scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the very large scale integration vlsi program and the congressionally mandated charged particle beam program 91 citation needed 93 many of the successful programs were transitioned to the services such as the foundation technologies in automatic target recognition space based sensing propulsion and materials that were transferred to the strategic defense initiative organization sdio later known as the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo now titled the missile defense agency mda recent history 1981 present edit during the 1980s the attention of the agency was centered on information processing and aircraft related programs including the national aerospace plane nasp or hypersonic research program the strategic computing program enabled darpa to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the vietnam war in addition darpa began to pursue new concepts for small lightweight satellites lightsat and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing submarine technology and armor anti armor in 1981 two engineers robert mcghee and kenneth waldron started to develop the adaptive suspension vehicle asv nicknamed the walker at the ohio state university under a research contract from darpa 91 27 93 the vehicle was 17 feet long 8 feet wide and 10 5 feet high and had six legs to support its three ton aluminum body in which it was designed to carry cargo over difficult terrains however darpa lost interest in the asv after problems with cold weather tests 91 28 93 on february 4 2004 the agency shut down its so called lifelog project the project s aim would have been to gather in a single place just about everything an individual says sees or does 91 29 93 on october 28 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in arlington county virginia a few miles from the pentagon 91 30 93 in fall 2011 darpa hosted the 100 year starship symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel 91 31 93 on june 5 2016 nasa and darpa announced that it planned to build new x planes with nasa s plan setting to create a whole series of x planes over the next 10 years 91 32 93 between 2014 and 2016 darpa shepherded the first machine to machine computer security competition the cyber grand challenge cgc bringing a group of top notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities exploit them and create fixes that patch those vulnerabilities in a fully automated fashion 91 33 93 91 34 93 in june 2018 darpa leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the gxv t program the goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions which due to maneuverability and other tricks can successfully resist modern anti tank weapon systems 91 35 93 in september 2020 darpa and the us air force announced that the hypersonic air breathing weapon concept hawc are ready for free flight tests within the next year 91 36 93 victoria coleman became the director of darpa in november 2020 91 37 93 in recent years darpa officials have contracted out core functions to corporations for example during fiscal year 2020 chenega
