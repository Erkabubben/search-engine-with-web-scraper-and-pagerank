march 13 2011 91 1 93 was an american psychologist who made many contributions to the formal analysis of human cognition working primarily within the frameworks of mathematical psychology symbolic artificial intelligence and parallel distributed processing he also admired formal linguistic approaches to cognition and explored the possibility of formulating a formal grammar to capture the

theora ballard rumelhart 91 2 93 he began his college education at the university of south dakota receiving a b a in psychology and mathematics in 1963 he studied mathematical psychology at stanford university receiving his ph d in 1967 from 1967 to 1987 he served on the faculty of the department of psychology at the university of california san diego in 1987 he moved to stanford university

back propagation algorithm also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by seppo linnainmaa in 1970 to multi layer neural networks this work showed through experiments that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data the approach has been widely used for basic cognition researches e g memory visual recognition and practical applications this paper however does not cite earlier work of the backpropagation method such as the 1974 dissertation 91 5 93 of paul werbos in the same year rumelhart also published parallel distributed processing explorations in the microstructure of cognition 91 6 93 with james mcclelland which described their creation of computer simulations of perceptrons giving to computer scientists their first testable models of neural processing and which is now regarded as a central text in the field of cognitive science 91 1 93 rumelhart s models of semantic cognition and specific knowledge in a diversity of learned domains using initially non hierarchical neuron like processing units continue to interest scientists in the fields of artificial intelligence anthropology information science and decision science in his honor in 2000 the robert j glushko and pamela samuelson foundation created the david e rumelhart prize for contributions to the theoretical foundations of human cognition 91 1 93 91 7
