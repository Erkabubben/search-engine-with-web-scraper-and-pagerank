shelley her father was the political philosopher william godwin and her mother was the philosopher and women s rights advocate mary wollstonecraft mary s mother died less than a fortnight after giving

already married together with her stepsister claire clairmont she and percy left for france and travelled through europe upon their return to england mary was pregnant with percy s child over the next two years she and percy faced ostracism constant debt and the death of their prematurely born daughter they married in late 1816 after the suicide of percy shelley s first wife harriet in 1816 the couple and mary s stepsister famously spent a summer with lord byron and john william polidori near geneva switzerland where shelley conceived the idea for her novel frankenstein the shelleys left britain in 1818 for italy where their second and third children died before shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child percy florence shelley in 1822 her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near viareggio a year later shelley returned to england and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author the last decade of her life was dogged by illness most likely caused by the brain tumour which killed her at age 53 until the 1970s shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband s works and for her novel frankenstein which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of shelley s achievements scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output particularly in her novels which include the historical novels valperga 1823 and perkin warbeck 1830 the apocalyptic novel the last man 1826 and her final two novels lodore 1835 and falkner 1837 studies of her lesser known works such as the travel book rambles in germany and italy 1844 and the biographical articles for dionysius lardner s cabinet cyclopaedia 1829 1846 support the growing view that shelley remained a political radical throughout her life shelley s works often argue that cooperation and sympathy particularly as practised by women in the family were the ways to reform civil society this view was a direct challenge to the individualistic romantic ethos promoted by percy shelley and the enlightenment political theories

fourth row mary shelley was born mary wollstonecraft godwin in somers town london in 1797 she was the second child of the feminist philosopher educator and writer mary wollstonecraft and the first child of the philosopher novelist and journalist william godwin wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after mary was born godwin was left to bring up mary along with her older half sister fanny imlay wollstonecraft s child by the american speculator gilbert imlay 91 5 93 a year after wollstonecraft s death godwin published his memoirs of the author of a vindication of the rights of woman 1798 which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute however because the memoirs revealed wollstonecraft s affairs and her illegitimate child they were seen as shocking mary godwin read these memoirs and her mother s books and was brought up to cherish her mother s memory 91 6 93 mary s earliest years were happy judging from the letters of william godwin s housekeeper and nurse louisa jones 91 7 93 but godwin was often deeply in debt feeling that he could not raise the children by himself he cast about for a second wife 91 8 93 in december 1801 he married mary jane clairmont a well educated woman with two young children of her own charles and claire 91 note 1 93 most of godwin s friends disliked his new wife describing her as quick tempered and quarrelsome 91 9 93 91 note 2 93 but godwin was devoted to her and the marriage was a success 91 10 93 mary godwin on the other hand came to detest her stepmother 91 3 93 william godwin s 19th century biographer charles kegan paul later suggested that mrs godwin had favoured her own children over those of mary wollstonecraft 91 4 93 together the godwins started a publishing firm called m j godwin which sold children s books as well as stationery maps and games however the business did not turn a profit and godwin was forced to borrow substantial sums to keep it going 91 11 93 he continued to borrow to pay off earlier loans compounding his problems by 1809 godwin s business was close to failure and he was near to despair 91 12 93 godwin was saved from debtor s prison by philosophical devotees such as francis place who lent him further money 91 13 93 the polygon at left in somers town london between camden town and st pancras where mary godwin was born and spent her earliest years though mary godwin received little formal education her father tutored her in a broad range of subjects he often took the children on educational outings and they had access to his library and to the many intellectuals who visited him including the romantic poet samuel taylor coleridge and the former vice president of the united states aaron burr 91 14 93 godwin admitted he was not educating the children according to mary wollstonecraft s philosophy as outlined in works such as a vindication of the rights of woman 1792 but mary godwin nonetheless received an unusual and advanced education for a girl of the time she had a governess a daily tutor and read many of her father s children s books on roman and greek history in manuscript 91 15 93 for six months in 1811 she also attended a boarding school in ramsgate 91 16 93 her father described her at age 15 as singularly bold somewhat imperious and active of mind her desire of knowledge is great and her perseverance in everything she undertakes almost invincible 91 17 93 in june 1812 mary s father sent her to stay with the dissenting family of the radical william baxter near dundee scotland 91 18 93 to baxter he wrote i am anxious that she should be brought up 160 160 like a philosopher even like a cynic 91 19 93 scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health to remove her from the seamy side of the business or to introduce her to radical politics 91 20 93 mary godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of baxter s house and in the companionship of his four daughters and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months 91 21 93 in the 1831 introduction to frankenstein she recalled i wrote then but in a most common place style it was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near that my true compositions the airy flights of my imagination were born and fostered 91 22 93 percy bysshe shelley on 26 june 1814 mary godwin declared her love for percy shelley at mary wollstonecraft s graveside in the churchyard of st pancras old church shown here in 1815 91 23 93 mary godwin may have first met the radical poet philosopher percy bysshe shelley in the interval between her two stays in scotland 91 24 93 by the time she returned home for a second time on 30 march 1814 percy shelley had become estranged from his wife and was regularly visiting william godwin whom he had agreed to bail out of debt 91 25 93 percy shelley s radicalism particularly his economic views which he had imbibed from william godwin s political justice 1793 had alienated him from his wealthy aristocratic family they wanted him to follow traditional models of the landed aristocracy and he wanted to donate large amounts of the family s money to schemes intended to help the disadvantaged percy shelley therefore had difficulty gaining access to money until he inherited his estate because his family did not want him wasting it on projects of political justice after several months of promises shelley announced that he either could not or would not pay off all of godwin s debts godwin was angry and felt betrayed 91 26 93 mary and percy began meeting each other secretly at her mother mary wollstonecraft s grave in the churchyard of st pancras old church and they fell in love she was 16 and he was 21 91 27 93 on 26 june 1814 shelley and godwin declared their love for one another as shelley announced he could not hide his ardent passion leading her in a sublime and rapturous moment to say she felt the same way on either that day or the next godwin lost her virginity to shelley which tradition claims happened in the churchyard 91 28 93 godwin described herself as attracted to shelley s wild intellectual unearthly looks 91 29 93 to mary s dismay her father disapproved and tried to thwart the relationship and salvage the spotless fame of his daughter at about the same time mary s father learned of shelley s inability to pay off the father s debts 91 30 93 mary who later wrote of my excessive and romantic attachment to my father 91 31 93 was confused she saw percy shelley as an embodiment of her parents liberal and reformist ideas of the 1790s particularly godwin s view that marriage was a repressive monopoly which he had argued in his 1793 edition of political justice but later retracted 91 32 93 on 28 july 1814 the couple eloped and secretly left for france taking mary s stepsister claire clairmont with them 91 33 93 after convincing mary jane godwin who had pursued them to calais that they did not wish to return the trio travelled to paris and then by donkey mule carriage and foot through a france recently ravaged by war to switzerland it was acting in a novel being an incarnate romance mary shelley recalled in 1826 91 34 93 godwin wrote about france in 1814 the distress of the inhabitants whose houses had been burned their cattle killed and all their wealth destroyed has given a sting to my detestation of war 91 35 93 as they travelled mary and percy read works by mary wollstonecraft and others kept a joint journal and continued their own writing 91 36 93 at lucerne lack of money forced the three to turn back they travelled down the rhine and by land to the dutch port of maassluis arriving at gravesend kent on 13 september 1814 91 37 93 percy bysshe shelley was inspired by the radicalism of godwin s political justice 1793 when the poet robert southey met shelley he felt as if he were seeing himself from the 1790s 91 38 93 portrait by amelia curran 1819 the situation awaiting mary godwin in england was fraught with complications some of which she had not foreseen either before or during the journey she had become pregnant she and percy now found themselves penniless and to mary s genuine surprise her father refused to have anything to do with her 91 39 93 the couple moved with claire into lodgings at somers town and later nelson square they maintained their intense programme of reading and writing and entertained percy shelley s friends such as thomas jefferson hogg and the writer thomas love peacock 91 40 93 percy shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors 91 41 93 the couple s distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations 91 42 93 pregnant and often ill mary godwin had to cope with percy s joy at the birth of his son by harriet shelley in late 1814 and his constant outings with claire clairmont 91 note 3 93 shelley and clairmont were almost certainly lovers which caused much jealousy on godwin s part 91 43 93 shelley greatly offended godwin at one point when during a walk in the french countryside he suggested that they both take the plunge into a stream naked as it offended her principles 91 44 93 she was partly consoled by the visits of hogg whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend 91 45 93 percy shelley seems to have wanted mary godwin and hogg to become lovers 91 46 93 mary did not dismiss the idea since in principle she believed in free love 91 47 93 in practice however she loved only percy shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with hogg 91 48 93 91 note 4 93 on 22 february 1815 she gave birth to a two month premature baby girl who was not expected to survive 91 49 93 on 6 march she wrote to hogg my dearest hogg my baby is dead will you come to see me as soon as you can i wish to see you it was perfectly well when i went to bed i awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that i would not awake it it was dead then but we did not find that out till morning from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions will you come you are so calm a creature amp shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk for i am no longer a mother now 91 50 93 the loss of her child induced acute depression in mary godwin who was haunted by visions of the baby but she conceived again and had recovered by the summer 91 51 93 with a revival in percy shelley s finances after the death of his grandfather sir bysshe shelley the couple holidayed in torquay and then rented a two storey cottage at bishopsgate on the edge of windsor great park 91 52 93 little is known about this period in mary godwin s life since her journal from may 1815 to july 1816 is lost at bishopsgate percy wrote his poem alastor or the spirit of solitude and on 24 january 1816 mary gave birth to a second child william named after her father and soon nicknamed willmouse in her novel the last man she later imagined windsor as a garden of eden 91 53 93 lake geneva and frankenstein draft of frankenstein or the modern prometheus it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld my man completed 160 in may 1816 mary godwin percy shelley and their son travelled to geneva with claire clairmont they planned to spend the summer with the poet lord byron whose recent affair with claire had left her pregnant 91 54 93 in history of a six weeks tour through a part of france switzerland germany and holland 1817 she describes the particularly desolate landscape in crossing from france into switzerland 91 55 93 the party arrived in geneva on 14 may 1816 where mary called herself mrs shelley byron joined them on 25 may with his young physician john william polidori 91 56 93 and rented the villa diodati close to lake geneva at the village of cologny percy shelley rented a smaller building called maison chapuis on the waterfront nearby 91 57 93 they spent their time writing boating on the lake and talking late into the night 91 58 93 it proved a wet ungenial summer mary shelley remembered in 1831 and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house 91 59 93 91 note 5 93 sitting around a log fire at byron s villa the company amused themselves with german ghost stories which prompted byron to propose that they each write a ghost story 91 60 93 91 61 93 unable to think of a story young mary godwin became anxious have you thought of a story i was asked each morning and each morning i was forced to reply with a mortifying negative 91 62 93 during one mid june evening the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life perhaps a corpse would be re animated mary noted galvanism had given token of such things 91 63 93 it was after midnight before they retired and unable to sleep she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her waking dream her ghost story 91 64 93 i saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together i saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out and then on the working of some powerful engine show signs of life and stir with an uneasy half vital motion frightful must it be for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator of the world 91 65 93 91 note 6 93 she began writing what she assumed would be a short story with percy shelley s encouragement she expanded this tale into her first novel frankenstein or the modern prometheus published in 1818 91 66 93 she later described that summer in switzerland as the moment when i first stepped out from childhood into life 91 56 93 the story of the writing of frankenstein has been fictionalised several times and formed the basis for a number of films in september 2011 the astronomer donald olson after a visit to the lake geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars concluded that her waking dream took place between 2am and 3am 16 june 1816 several days after the initial idea by lord byron that they each write a ghost story 91 67 93 authorship of frankenstein while her husband percy encouraged her writing the extent of percy s contribution to the novel is unknown and has been argued over by readers and critics 91 68 93 mary shelley wrote i certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident nor scarcely of one train of feeling to my husband and yet but for his incitement it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world she wrote that the preface to the first edition was percy s work as far as i can recollect there are differences in the 1818 1823 and 1831 editions which have been attributed to percy s editing james rieger concluded percy s assistance at every point in the book s manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator while anne k mellor later argued percy only made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text 91 69 93 charles e robinson editor of a facsimile edition of the frankenstein manuscripts concluded that percy s contributions to the book were no more than what most publishers editors have provided new or old authors or in fact what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other s works in progress 91 70 93 writing on the 200th anniversary of frankenstein literary scholar and poet fiona sampson asked why hasn t mary shelley gotten the respect she deserves 91 71 93 she noted that in recent years percy s corrections visible in the frankenstein notebooks held at the bodleian library in oxford have been seized on as evidence that he must have at least co authored the novel in fact when i examined the notebooks myself i realized that percy did rather less than any line editor working in publishing today 91 72 93 sampson published her findings in in search of mary shelley 2018 one of many biographies written about shelley bath and marlow on their return to england in september mary and percy moved with claire clairmont who took lodgings nearby to bath where they hoped to keep claire s pregnancy secret 91 73 93 at cologny mary godwin had received two letters from her half sister fanny imlay who alluded to her unhappy life on 9 october fanny wrote an alarming letter from bristol that sent percy shelley racing off to search for her without success on the morning of 10 october fanny imlay was found dead in a room at a swansea inn along with a suicide note and a laudanum bottle on 10 december percy shelley s wife harriet was discovered drowned in the serpentine a lake in hyde park london 91 74 93 both suicides were hushed up harriet s family obstructed percy shelley s efforts fully supported by mary godwin to assume custody of his two children by harriet his lawyers advised him to improve his case by marrying so he and mary who was pregnant again married on 30 december 1816 at st mildred s church bread street london 91 75 93 mr and mrs godwin were present and the marriage ended the family rift 91 76 93 claire clairmont gave birth to a baby girl on 13 january at first called alba later allegra 91 77 93 91 note 7 93 in march of that year the chancery court ruled percy shelley morally unfit to assume custody of his children and later placed them with a clergyman s family 91 78 93 also in march the shelleys moved with claire and alba to albion house at marlow buckinghamshire a large damp building on the river thames there mary shelley gave birth to her third child clara on 2 september at marlow they entertained their new friends marianne and leigh hunt worked hard at their writing and often discussed politics 91 68 93 early in the summer of 1817 mary shelley finished frankenstein which was published anonymously in january 1818 reviewers and readers assumed that percy shelley was the author since the book was published with his preface and dedicated to his political hero william godwin 91 79 93 at marlow mary edited the joint journal of the group s 1814 continental journey adding material written in switzerland in 1816 along with percy s poem mont blanc the result was the history of a six weeks tour published in november 1817 that autumn percy shelley often lived away from home in london to evade creditors the threat of a debtor s prison combined with their ill health and fears of losing custody of their children contributed to the couple s decision to leave england for italy on 12 march 1818 taking claire clairmont and alba with them 91 80 93 they had no intention of returning 91 81 93 italy william willmouse shelley painted just before his death from malaria in 1819 portrait by amelia curran 1819 one of the party s first tasks on arriving in italy was to hand alba over to byron who was living in venice he had agreed to raise her so long as claire had nothing more to do with her 91 82 93 the shelleys then embarked on a roving existence never settling in any one place for long 91 83 93 91 note 8 93 along the way they accumulated a circle of friends and acquaintances who often moved with them the couple devoted their time to writing reading learning sightseeing and socialising the italian adventure was however blighted for mary shelley by the deaths of both her children clara in september 1818 in venice and william in june 1819 in rome 91 84 93 91 note 9 93 these losses left her in a deep depression that isolated her from percy shelley 91 85 93 who wrote in his notebook my dearest mary wherefore hast thou gone and left me in this dreary world alone thy form is here indeed a lovely one but thou art fled gone down a dreary road that leads to sorrow s most obscure abode for thine own sake i cannot follow thee do thou return for mine 91 86 93 for a time mary shelley found comfort only in her writing 91 87 93 the birth of her fourth child percy florence on 12 november 1819 finally lifted her spirits 91 88 93 though she nursed the memory of her lost children till the end of her life 91 89 93 italy provided the shelleys byron and other exiles with political freedom unattainable at home despite its associations with personal loss italy became for mary shelley a country which memory painted as paradise 91 90 93 their italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity for both shelleys while percy composed a series of major poems mary wrote the novel matilda 91 91 93 the historical novel valperga and the plays proserpine and midas mary wrote valperga to help alleviate her father s financial difficulties as percy refused to assist him further 91 92 93 she was often physically ill however and prone to depressions she also had to cope with percy s interest in other women such as sophia stacey emilia viviani and jane williams 91 93 93 since mary shelley shared his belief in the non exclusivity of marriage she formed emotional ties of her own among the men and women of their circle she became particularly fond of the greek revolutionary prince alexandros mavrokordatos and of jane and edward williams 91 94 93 91 note 10 93 in december 1818 the shelleys travelled south with claire clairmont and their servants to naples where they stayed for three months receiving only one visitor a physician 91 95 93 in 1820 they found themselves plagued by accusations and threats from paolo and elise foggi former servants whom percy shelley had dismissed in naples shortly after the foggis had married 91 96 93 the pair revealed that on 27 february 1819 in naples percy shelley had registered as his child by mary shelley a two month old baby girl named elena adelaide shelley 91 97 93 the foggis also claimed that claire clairmont was the baby s mother 91 98 93 biographers have offered various interpretations of these events that percy shelley decided to adopt a local child that the baby was his by elise claire or an unknown woman or that she was elise s by byron 91 99 93 91 note 11 93 mary shelley insisted she would have known if claire had been pregnant but it is unclear how much she really knew 91 100 93 the events in naples a city mary shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils 91 101 93 remain shrouded in mystery 91 note 12 93 the only certainty is that she herself was not the child s mother 91 101 93 elena adelaide shelley died in naples on 9 june 1820 91 102 93 after leaving naples the shelleys settled in rome the city where her husband wrote where the meanest streets were strewed with truncated columns broken capitals and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry the voice of dead time in still vibrations is breathed from these dumb things animated and glorified as they were by man 91 103 93 rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel valerius the reanimated roman where the eponymous hero resists the decay of rome and the machinations of superstitious catholicism 91 103 93 the writing of her novel was broken off when her son william died of malaria 91 103 93 shelley bitterly commented that she had come to italy to improve her husband s health and instead the italian climate had just killed her two children leading her to write may you my dear marianne never know what it is to lose two only and lovely children in one year to watch their dying moments and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable 91 104 93 to deal with her grief shelley wrote the novella the fields of fancy which became matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about the unnatural love i had inspired 91 105 93 the novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father s feelings 91 106 93 claire clairmont mary s stepsister and mistress of lord byron portrait by amelia curran 1819 in the summer of 1822 a pregnant mary moved with percy claire and edward and jane williams to the isolated villa magni at the sea s edge near the hamlet of san terenzo in the bay of lerici once they were settled in percy broke the evil news to claire that her daughter allegra had died of typhus in a convent at bagnacavallo 91 107 93 mary shelley was distracted and unhappy in the cramped and remote villa magni which she came to regard as a dungeon 91 108 93 on 16 june she miscarried losing so much blood that she nearly died rather than wait for a doctor percy sat her in a bath of ice to stanch the bleeding an act the doctor later told him saved her life 91 109 93 all was not well between the couple that summer however and percy spent more time with jane williams than with his depressed and debilitated wife 91 110 93 much of the short poetry shelley wrote at san terenzo involved jane rather than mary 91 111 93 the coast offered percy shelley and edward williams the chance to enjoy their perfect plaything for the summer a new sailing boat 91 112 93 the boat had been designed by daniel roberts and edward trelawny an admirer of byron s who had joined the party in january 1822 91 113 93 on 1 july 1822 percy shelley edward ellerker williams and captain daniel roberts sailed south down the coast to livorno there percy shelley discussed with byron and leigh hunt the launch of a radical magazine called the liberal 91 114 93 on 8 july he and edward williams set out on the return journey to lerici with their eighteen year old boat boy charles vivian 91 115 93 they never reached their destination a letter arrived at villa magni from hunt to percy shelley dated 8 july saying pray write to tell us how you got home for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday amp we are anxious 91 116 93 the paper fell from me mary told a friend later i trembled all over 91 116 93 she and jane williams rushed desperately to livorno and then to pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive ten days after the storm three bodies washed up on the coast near viareggio midway between livorno and lerici trelawny byron and hunt cremated percy shelley s corpse on the beach at viareggio 91 117 93 return to england and writing career frankenstein is the most wonderful work to have been written at twenty years of age that i ever heard of you are now five and twenty and most fortunately you have pursued a course of reading and cultivated your mind in a manner the most admirably adapted to make you a great and successful author if you cannot be independent who should be william godwin to mary shelley 91 118 93 after her husband s death mary shelley lived for a year with leigh hunt and his family in genoa where she often saw byron and transcribed his poems she resolved to live by her pen and for her son but her financial situation was precarious on 23 july 1823 she left genoa for england and stayed with her father and stepmother in the strand until a small advance from her father in law enabled her to lodge nearby 91 119 93 sir timothy shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson percy florence only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian mary shelley rejected this idea instantly 91 120 93 she managed instead to wring out of sir timothy a limited annual allowance which she had to repay when percy florence inherited the estate but to the end of his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers mary shelley busied herself with editing her husband s poems among other literary endeavours but concern for her son restricted her options sir timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published 91 121 93 in 1826 percy florence became the legal heir of the shelley estate after the death of his half brother charles shelley his father s son by harriet shelley sir timothy raised mary s allowance from 100 a year to 250 but remained as difficult as ever 91 122 93 mary shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of william godwin s circle but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished she also felt ostracised by those who like sir timothy still disapproved of her relationship with percy bysshe shelley 91 123 93 in the summer of 1824 mary shelley moved to kentish town in north london to be near jane williams she may have been in the words of her biographer muriel spark a little in love with jane jane later disillusioned her by gossiping that percy had preferred her to mary owing to mary s inadequacy as a wife 91 124 93 at around this time mary shelley was working on her novel the last man 1826 and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of byron and percy shelley the beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband 91 125 93 she also met the american actor john howard payne and the american writer washington irving who intrigued her payne fell in love with her and in 1826 asked her to marry him she refused saying that after being married to one genius she could only marry another 91 126 93 payne accepted the rejection and tried without success to talk his friend irving into proposing himself mary shelley was aware of payne s plan but how seriously she took it is unclear 91 127 93 reginald easton s miniature of mary shelley is allegedly drawn from her death mask c 160 1857 91 128 93 in 1827 mary shelley was party to a scheme that enabled her friend isabel robinson and isabel s lover mary diana dods who wrote under the name david lyndsay to embark on a life together in france as husband and wife 91 129 93 91 note 13 93 with the help of payne whom she kept in the dark about the details mary shelley obtained false passports for the couple 91 130 93 in 1828 she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in paris weeks later she recovered unscarred but without her youthful beauty 91 131 93 during the period 1827 40 mary shelley was busy as an editor and writer she wrote the novels the fortunes of perkin warbeck 1830 lodore 1835 and falkner 1837 she contributed five volumes of lives of italian spanish portuguese and french authors to lardner s cabinet cyclopaedia she also wrote stories for ladies magazines she was still helping to support her father and they looked out for publishers for each other 91 132 93 in 1830 she sold the copyright for a new edition of frankenstein for 60 to henry colburn and richard bentley for their new standard novels series 91 133 93 after her father s death in 1836 at the age of eighty she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication as he had requested in his will but after two years of work she abandoned the project 91 134 93 throughout this period she also championed percy shelley s poetry promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing by 1837 percy s works were well known and increasingly admired 91 135 93 in the summer of 1838 edward moxon the publisher of tennyson and the son in law of charles lamb proposed publishing a collected works of percy shelley mary was paid 500 to edit the poetical works 1838 which sir timothy insisted should not include a biography mary found a way to tell the story of percy s life nonetheless she included extensive biographical notes about the poems 91 136 93 shelley continued to practice her mother s feminist principles by extending aid to women whom society disapproved of 91 137 93 for instance shelley extended financial aid to mary diana dods a single mother and illegitimate herself who appears to have been a lesbian and gave her the new identity of walter sholto douglas husband of her lover isabel robinson 91 137 93 shelley also assisted georgiana paul a woman disallowed for by her husband for alleged adultery 91 138 93 shelley in her diary about her assistance to the latter i do not make a boast i do not say aloud behold my generosity and greatness of mind for in truth it is simple justice i perform and so i am still reviled for being worldly 91 138 93 mary shelley continued to treat potential romantic partners with caution in 1828 she met and flirted with the french writer prosper m rim e but her one surviving letter to him appears to be a deflection of his declaration of love 91 139 93 she was delighted when her old friend from italy edward trelawny returned to england and they joked about marriage in their letters 91 140 93 their friendship had altered however following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of percy shelley and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of queen mab from percy shelley s poems 91 141 93 oblique references in her journals from the early 1830s until the early 1840s suggest that mary shelley had feelings for the radical politician aubrey beauclerk who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others 91 142 93 91 note 14 93 mary shelley s first concern during these years was the welfare of percy florence she honoured her late husband s wish that his son attend public school and with sir timothy s grudging help had him educated at harrow to avoid boarding fees she moved to harrow on the hill herself so that percy could attend as a day scholar 91 143 93 though percy went on to trinity college cambridge and dabbled in politics and the law he showed no sign of his parents gifts 91 144 93 he was devoted to his mother and after he left university in 1841 he came to live with her 91 citation needed 93 final years and death in 1840 and 1842 mother and son travelled together on the continent journeys that mary shelley recorded in rambles in germany and italy in 1840 1842 and 1843 1844 91 145 93 in 1844 sir timothy shelley finally died at the age of ninety falling from the stalk like an overblown flower as mary put it 91 146 93 for the first time she and her son were financially independent though the estate proved less valuable than they had hoped 91 147 93 in order to fulfil mary shelley s wishes percy florence and his wife jane had the coffins of mary shelley s parents exhumed and buried with her in bournemouth 91 148 93 in the mid 1840s mary shelley found herself the target of three separate blackmailers in 1845 an italian political exile called gatteschi whom she had met in paris threatened to publish letters she had sent him a friend of her son s bribed a police chief into seizing gatteschi s papers including the letters which were then destroyed 91 149 93 shortly afterwards mary shelley bought some letters written by herself and percy bysshe shelley from a man calling himself g byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late lord byron 91 150 93 also in 1845 percy bysshe shelley s cousin thomas medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of percy shelley he said he would suppress it in return for 250 but mary shelley refused 91 151 93 91 note 15 93 in 1848 percy florence married jane gibson st john the marriage proved a happy one and mary shelley and jane were fond of each other 91 152 93 mary lived with her son and daughter in law at field place sussex the shelleys ancestral home and at chester square london and accompanied them on travels abroad 91 citation needed 93 mary shelley s last years were blighted by illness from 1839 she suffered from headaches and bouts of paralysis in parts of her body which sometimes prevented her from reading and writing 91 153 93 on 1 february 1851 at chester square she died at the age of fifty three from what her physician suspected was a brain tumour according to jane shelley mary shelley had asked to be buried with her mother and father but percy and jane judging the graveyard at st pancras to be dreadful chose to bury her instead at st peter s church bournemouth near their new home at boscombe 91 154 93 on the first anniversary of mary shelley s death the shelleys opened her box desk inside they found locks of her dead children s hair a notebook she had shared with percy bysshe shelley and a copy of his poem adona s with one page folded round a silk parcel containing some of his ashes and the remains of his heart 91 89 93 literary themes and styles mary shelley lived a literary life her father encouraged her to learn to write by composing letters 91 155 93 and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories 91 156 93 unfortunately all of mary s juvenilia were lost when she ran off with percy in 1814 and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year 91 157 93 her first published work is often thought to have been mounseer nongtongpaw 91 158 93 comic verses written for godwin s juvenile library when she was ten and a half however the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works 91 159 93 percy shelley enthusiastically encouraged mary shelley s writing my husband was from the first very anxious that i should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enrol myself on the page of fame he was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation 91 160 93 novels autobiographical elements certain sections of mary shelley s novels are often interpreted as masked rewritings of her life critics have pointed to the recurrence of the father daughter motif in particular as evidence of this autobiographical style 91 161 93 for example commentators frequently read mathilda 1820 autobiographically identifying the three central characters as versions of mary shelley william godwin and percy shelley 91 162 93 mary shelley herself confided that she modelled the central characters of the last man on her italian circle lord raymond who leaves england to fight for the greeks and dies in constantinople is based on lord byron and the utopian adrian earl of windsor who leads his followers in search of a natural paradise and dies when his boat sinks in a storm is a fictional portrait of percy bysshe shelley 91 163 93 however as she wrote in her review of godwin s novel cloudesley 1830 she did not believe that authors were merely copying from our own hearts 91 164 93 william godwin regarded his daughter s characters as types rather than portraits from real life 91 165 93 some modern critics such as patricia clemit and jane blumberg have taken the same view resisting autobiographical readings of mary shelley s works 91 166 93 novelistic genres euthanasia was never heard of more even her name perished the private chronicles from which the foregoing relation has been collected end with the death of euthanasia it is therefore in public histories alone that we find an account of the last years of the life of castruccio from mary shelley valperga 91 167 93 mary shelley employed the techniques of many different novelistic genres most vividly the godwinian novel walter scott s new historical novel and the gothic novel the godwinian novel made popular during the 1790s with works such as godwin s caleb williams 1794 employed a rousseauvian confessional form to explore the contradictory relations between the self and society 91 168 93 and frankenstein exhibits many of the same themes and literary devices as godwin s novel 91 169 93 however shelley critiques those enlightenment ideals that godwin promotes in his works 91 170 93 in the last man she uses the philosophical form of the godwinian novel to demonstrate the ultimate meaninglessness of the world 91 171 93 while earlier godwinian novels had shown how rational individuals could slowly improve society the last man and frankenstein demonstrate the individual s lack of control over history 91 172 93 shelley uses the historical novel to comment on gender relations for example valperga is a feminist version of scott s masculinist genre 91 173 93 introducing women into the story who are not part of the historical record shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions 91 174 93 shelley sets the male protagonist s compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative reason and sensibility 91 175 93 in perkin warbeck shelley s other historical novel lady gordon stands for the values of friendship domesticity and equality through her shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters the novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events 91 176 93 gender with the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s mary shelley s works particularly frankenstein began to attract much more attention from scholars feminist and psychoanalytic critics were largely responsible for the recovery from neglect of shelley as a writer 91 177 93 ellen moers was one of the first to claim that shelley s loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of frankenstein 91 178 93 she argues that the novel is a birth myth in which shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother s death as well as for failing as a parent 91 179 93 shelley scholar anne k mellor suggests that from a feminist viewpoint it is a story about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman 160 160 frankenstein is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction 91 180 93 victor frankenstein s failure as a parent in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy giving birth and particularly maternity 91 181 93 sandra gilbert and susan gubar argue in their seminal book the madwoman in the attic 1979 that in frankenstein in particular shelley responded to the masculine literary tradition represented by john milton s paradise lost in their interpretation shelley reaffirms this masculine tradition including the misogyny inherent in it but at the same time conceal s fantasies of equality that occasionally erupt in monstrous images of rage 91 182 93 mary poovey reads the first edition of frankenstein as part of a larger pattern in shelley s writing which begins with literary self assertion and ends with conventional femininity 91 183 93 poovey suggests that frankenstein s multiple narratives enable shelley to split her artistic persona she can express and efface herself at the same time 91 184 93 shelley s fear of self assertion is reflected in the fate of frankenstein who is punished for his egotism by losing all his domestic ties 91 185 93 feminist critics often focus on how authorship itself particularly female authorship is represented in and through shelley s novels 91 186 93 as mellor explains shelley uses the gothic style not only to explore repressed female sexual desire 91 187 93 but also as way to censor her own speech in frankenstein 91 188 93 according to poovey and mellor shelley did not want to promote her own authorial persona and felt deeply inadequate as a writer and this shame contributed to the generation of her fictional images of abnormality perversion and destruction 91 189 93 shelley s writings focus on the role of the family in society and women s role within that family she celebrates the feminine affections and compassion associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them 91 190 93 shelley was profoundly committed to an ethic of cooperation mutual dependence and self sacrifice 91 191 93 in lodore for example the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character lord lodore who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume leaving a trail of legal financial and familial obstacles for the two heroines to negotiate the novel is engaged with political and ideological issues particularly the education and social role of women 91 192 93 it dissects a patriarchal culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men in the view of shelley scholar betty t bennett the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings 91 193 93 however falkner is the only one of mary shelley s novels in which the heroine s agenda triumphs 91 194 93 the novel s resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity men will be freed to express the compassion sympathy and generosity of their better natures 91 195 93 enlightenment and romanticism frankenstein like much gothic fiction of the period mixes a visceral and alienating subject matter with speculative and thought provoking themes 91 196 93 rather than focusing on the twists and turns of the plot however the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist victor frankenstein and shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised romanticism one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional romanticism 91 197 93 victor frankenstein is like satan in paradise lost and prometheus he rebels against tradition he creates life and he shapes his own destiny these traits are not portrayed positively as blumberg writes his relentless ambition is a self delusion clothed as quest for truth 91 198 93 he must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition 91 199 93 the frontispiece to the 1831 frankenstein by theodor von holst one of the first two illustrations for the novel 91 200 93 mary shelley believed in the enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos 91 201 93 in practice her works largely criticise the way 18th century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about the creature in frankenstein for example reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless 91 202 93 shelley s works reveal her as less optimistic than godwin and wollstonecraft she lacks faith in godwin s theory that humanity could eventually be perfected 91 203 93 as literary scholar kari lokke writes the last man more so than frankenstein in its refusal to place humanity at the centre of the universe its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature 160 160 constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to western humanism 91 204 93 specifically mary shelley s allusions to what radicals believed was a failed revolution in france and the godwinian wollstonecraftian and burkean responses to it challenge enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts 91 205 93 as in frankenstein shelley offers a profoundly disenchanted commentary on the age of revolution which ends in a total rejection of the progressive ideals of her own generation 91 206 93 not only does she reject these enlightenment political ideals but she also rejects the romantic notion that the poetic or literary imagination can offer an alternative 91 207 93 politics there is a new scholarly emphasis on shelley as a lifelong reformer deeply engaged in the liberal and feminist concerns of her day 91 208 93 in 1820 she was thrilled by the liberal uprising in spain which forced the king to grant a constitution 91 209 93 in 1823 she wrote articles for leigh hunt s periodical the liberal and played an active role in the formulation of its outlook 91 210 93 she was delighted when the whigs came back to power in 1830 and at the prospect of the 1832 reform act 91 211 93 critics have until recently cited lodore and falkner as evidence of increasing conservatism in mary shelley s later works in 1984 mary poovey influentially identified the retreat of mary shelley s reformist politics into the separate sphere of the domestic 91 212 93 poovey suggested that mary shelley wrote falkner to resolve her conflicted response to her father s combination of libertarian radicalism and stern insistence on social decorum 91 213 93 mellor largely agreed arguing that mary shelley grounded her alternative political ideology on the metaphor of the peaceful loving bourgeois family she thereby implicitly endorsed a conservative vision of gradual evolutionary reform 91 214 93 this vision allowed women to participate in the public sphere but it inherited the inequalities inherent in the bourgeois family 91 215 93 however in the last decade or so this view has been challenged for example bennett claims that mary shelley s works reveal a consistent commitment to romantic idealism and political reform 91 216 93 and jane blumberg s study of shelley s early novels argues that her career cannot be easily divided into radical and conservative halves she contends that shelley was never a passionate radical like her husband and her later lifestyle was not abruptly assumed nor was it a betrayal she was in fact challenging the political and literary influences of her circle in her first work 91 217 93 in this reading shelley s early works are interpreted as a challenge to godwin and percy bysshe shelley s radicalism victor frankenstein s thoughtless rejection of family for example is seen as evidence of shelley s constant concern for the domestic 91 218 93 short stories shelley frequently wrote stories to accompany prepared illustrations for gift books such as this one which accompanied transformation in the 1830 the keepsake 91 219 93 in the 1820s and 1830s mary shelley frequently wrote short stories for gift books or annuals including sixteen for the keepsake which was aimed at middle class women and bound in silk with gilt edged pages 91 220 93 mary shelley s work in this genre has been described as that of a hack writer and wordy and pedestrian 91 221 93 however critic charlotte sussman points out that other leading writers of the day such as the romantic poets william wordsworth and samuel taylor coleridge also took advantage of this profitable market she explains that the annuals were a major mode of literary production in the 1820s and 1830s with the keepsake the most successful 91 222 93 many of shelley s stories are set in places or times far removed from early 19th century britain such as greece and the reign of henry iv of france shelley was particularly interested in the fragility of individual identity and often depicted the way a person s role in the world can be cataclysmically altered either by an internal emotional upheaval or by some supernatural occurrence that mirrors an internal schism 91 223 93 in her stories female identity is tied to a woman s short lived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed through the use of money 91 224 93 although mary shelley wrote twenty one short stories for the annuals between 1823 and 1839 she always saw herself above all as a novelist she wrote to leigh hunt i write bad articles which help to make me miserable but i am going to plunge into a novel and hope that its clear water will wash off the mud of the magazines 91 225 93 travelogues when they ran off to france in the summer of 1814 mary godwin and percy shelley began a joint journal 91 226 93 which they published in 1817 under the title history of a six weeks tour adding four letters two by each of them based on their visit to geneva in 1816 along with percy shelley s poem mont blanc the work celebrates youthful love and political idealism and consciously follows the example of mary wollstonecraft and others who had combined travelling with writing 91 227 93 the perspective of the history is philosophical and reformist rather than that of a conventional travelogue in particular it addresses the effects of politics and war on france 91 228 93 the letters the couple wrote on the second journey confront the great and extraordinary events of the final defeat of napoleon at waterloo after his hundred days return in 1815 they also explore the sublimity of lake geneva and mont blanc as well as the revolutionary legacy of the philosopher and novelist jean jacques rousseau 91 229 93 mary shelley s last full length book written in the form of letters and published in 1844 was rambles in germany and italy in 1840 1842 and 1843 which recorded her travels with her son percy florence and his university friends in rambles shelley follows the tradition of mary wollstonecraft s letters written in sweden norway and denmark and her own a history of a six weeks tour in mapping her personal and political landscape through the discourse of sensibility and sympathy 91 230 93 for shelley building sympathetic connections between people is the way to build civil society and to increase knowledge knowledge to enlighten and free the mind from clinging deadening prejudices a wider circle of sympathy with our fellow creatures these are the uses of travel 91 231 93 between observations on scenery culture and the people especially in a political point of view 91 232 93 she uses the travelogue form to explore her roles as a widow and mother and to reflect on revolutionary nationalism in italy 91 233 93 91 note 16 93 she also records her pilgrimage to scenes associated with percy shelley 91 234 93 according to critic clarissa orr mary shelley s adoption of a persona of philosophical motherhood gives rambles the unity of a prose poem with death and memory as central themes 91 235 93 at the same time shelley makes an egalitarian case against monarchy class distinctions slavery and war 91 236 93 biographies between 1832 and 1839 mary shelley wrote many biographies of notable italian spanish portuguese and french men and a few women for dionysius lardner s lives of the most eminent literary and scientific men these formed part of lardner s cabinet cyclopaedia one of the best of many such series produced in the 1820s and 1830s in response to growing middle class demand for self education 91 237 93 until the republication of these essays in 2002 their significance within her body of work was not appreciated 91 238 93 91 note 17 93 in the view of literary scholar greg kucich they reveal mary shelley s prodigious research across several centuries and in multiple languages her gift for biographical narrative and her interest in the emerging forms of feminist historiography 91 239 93 shelley wrote in a biographical style popularised by the 18th century critic samuel johnson in his lives of the poets 1779 81 combining secondary sources memoir and anecdote and authorial evaluation 91 240 93 she records details of each writer s life and character quotes their writing in the original as well as in translation and ends with a critical assessment of their achievement 91 241 93 for shelley biographical writing was supposed to in her words form as it were a school in which to study the philosophy of history 91 242 93 and to teach lessons most frequently and importantly these lessons consisted of criticisms of male dominated institutions such as primogeniture 91 243 93 shelley emphasises domesticity romance family sympathy and compassion in the lives of her subjects her conviction that such forces could improve society connects her biographical approach with that of other early feminist historians such as mary hays and anna jameson 91 244 93 unlike her novels most of which had an original print run of several hundred copies the lives had a print run of about 4 000 for each volume thus according to kucich mary shelley s use of biography to forward the social agenda of women s historiography became one of her most influential political interventions 91 245 93 editorial work the qualities that struck anyone newly introduced to shelley were first a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement mary shelley preface poetical works of percy bysshe shelley 91 246 93 soon after percy shelley s death mary shelley determined to write his biography in a letter of 17 november 1822 she announced i shall write his life amp thus occupy myself in the only manner from which i can derive consolation 91 247 93 however her father in law sir timothy shelley effectively banned her from doing so 91 248 93 91 note 18 93 mary began her fostering of percy s poetic reputation in 1824 with the publication of his posthumous poems in 1839 while she was working on the lives she prepared a new edition of his poetry which became in the words of literary scholar susan j wolfson the canonizing event in the history of her husband s reputation 91 249 93 the following year mary shelley edited a volume of her husband s essays letters translations and fragments and throughout the 1830s she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual the keepsake 91 250 93 evading sir timothy s ban on a biography mary shelley often included in these editions her own annotations and reflections on her husband s life and work 91 251 93 i am to justify his ways she had declared in 1824 i am to make him beloved to all posterity 91 252 93 it was this goal argues blumberg that led her to present percy s work to the public in the most popular form possible 91 253 93 to tailor his works for a victorian audience she cast percy shelley as a lyrical rather than a political poet 91 254 93 as mary favret writes the disembodied percy identifies the spirit of poetry itself 91 255 93 mary glossed percy s political radicalism as a form of sentimentalism arguing that his republicanism arose from sympathy for those who were suffering 91 256 93 she inserted romantic anecdotes of his benevolence domesticity and love of the natural world 91 257 93 portraying herself as percy s practical muse she also noted how she had suggested revisions as he wrote 91 258 93 despite the emotions stirred by this task mary shelley arguably proved herself in many respects a professional and scholarly editor 91 259 93 working from percy s messy sometimes indecipherable notebooks she attempted to form a chronology for his writings and she included poems such as epipsychidion addressed to emilia viviani which she would rather have left out 91 260 93 she was forced however into several compromises and as blumberg notes modern critics have found fault with the edition and claim variously that she miscopied misinterpreted purposely obscured and attempted to turn the poet into something he was not 91 261 93 according to wolfson donald reiman a modern editor of percy bysshe shelley s works still refers to mary shelley s editions while acknowledging that her editing style belongs to an age of editing when the aim was not to establish accurate texts and scholarly apparatus but to present a full record of a writer s career for the general reader 91 262 93 in principle mary shelley believed in publishing every last word of her husband s work 91 263 93 but she found herself obliged to omit certain passages either by pressure from her publisher edward moxon or in deference to public propriety 91 264 93 for example she removed the atheistic passages from queen mab for the first edition after she restored them in the second edition moxon was prosecuted and convicted of blasphemous libel though the prosecution was brought out of principle by the chartist publisher henry hetherington and no punishment was sought 91 265 93 mary shelley s omissions provoked criticism often stinging from members of percy shelley s former circle 91 266 93 and reviewers accused her of among other things indiscriminate inclusions 91 267 93 her notes have nevertheless remained an essential source for the study of percy shelley s work as bennett explains biographers and critics agree that mary shelley s commitment to bring shelley the notice she believed his works merited was the single major force that established shelley s reputation during a period when he almost certainly would have faded from public view 91 268 93 reputation engraving by george stodart after a monument of mary and percy shelley by henry weekes 1853 in her own lifetime mary shelley was taken seriously as a writer though reviewers often missed her writings political edge after her death however she was chiefly remembered as the wife of percy bysshe shelley and as the author of frankenstein 91 269 93 in fact in the introduction to her letters published in 1945 editor frederick jones wrote a collection of the present size could not be justified by the general quality of the letters or by mary shelley s importance as a writer it is as the wife of percy bysshe shelley that she excites our interest 91 270 93 this attitude had not disappeared by 1980 when betty t bennett published the first volume of mary shelley s complete letters as she explains the fact is that until recent years scholars have generally regarded mary wollstonecraft shelley as a result william godwin s and mary wollstonecraft s daughter who became shelley s pygmalion 91 271 93 it was not until emily sunstein s mary shelley romance and reality in 1989 that a full length scholarly biography was published 91 272 93 the attempts of mary shelley s son and daughter in law to victorianise her memory by censoring biographical documents contributed to a perception of mary shelley as a more conventional less reformist figure than her works suggest her own timid omissions from percy shelley s works and her quiet avoidance of public controversy in her later years added to this impression commentary by hogg trelawny and other admirers of percy shelley also tended to downplay mary shelley s radicalism trelawny s records of shelley byron and the author 1878 praised percy shelley at the expense of mary questioning her intelligence and even her authorship of frankenstein 91 273 93 lady shelley percy florence s wife responded in part by presenting a severely edited collection of letters she had inherited published privately as shelley and mary in 1882 91 274 93 from frankenstein s first theatrical adaptation in 1823 to the cinematic adaptations of the 20th century including the first cinematic version in 1910 and now famous versions such as james whale s 1931 frankenstein mel brooks satirical 1974 young frankenstein and kenneth branagh s 1994 mary shelley s frankenstein many audiences first encounter the work of mary shelley through adaptation 91 275 93 over the course of the 19th century mary shelley came to be seen as a one novel author at best rather than as the professional writer she was most of her works have remained out of print until the last thirty years obstructing a larger view of her achievement 91 276 93 in recent decades the republication of almost all her writing has stimulated a new recognition of its value her habit of intensive reading and study revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works is now better appreciated 91 277 93 shelley s conception of herself as an author has also been recognised after percy s death she wrote of her authorial ambitions i think that i can maintain myself and there is something inspiriting in the idea 91 278 93 scholars now consider mary shelley to be a major romantic figure significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal 91 274 93 selected works main article mary shelley bibliography history of a six weeks tour 1817 frankenstein or the modern prometheus 1818 mathilda 1819 valperga or the

history to avoid confusion this article calls her claire throughout william st clair in his biography of the godwins and the shelleys notes that it is easy to forget in reading of these crises in the lives of the godwins and the shelleys how unrepresentative the references in surviving documents may be it is easy for the biographer to give undue weight to the opinions of the people who happen to
