grey relational analysis from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from grey system theory jump to navigation jump to search grey relational analysis gra was developed by deng julong of huazhong university of science and technology it is one of the most widely used models of grey system theory gra uses a specific concept of information it defines situations with no information as black and those with perfect information as white however neither of these idealized situations ever occurs in real world problems in fact situations between these extremes which contain partial information are described as being grey hazy or fuzzy a variant of gra model taguchi based gra model is a popular optimization method in manufacturing engineering contents 1 definition 2 history 3 references 4

dynamic gra model it is the generalized form of deng s gra model history edit gra is an important part of grey system theory pioneered by deng julong in 1982 91 2 93 a grey system means that a system in which part of information is known and part of information is unknown formally grey systems theory describes uncertainty by interval valued unknowns called grey numbers with the width of the interval reflecting more or less precise knowledge 91 3 93 with this definition information quantity and quality form a continuum from a total lack of information to complete information from black through grey to white since uncertainty always exists one is always somewhere in the middle somewhere between the extremes somewhere in the grey area grey analysis then comes to a clear set of statements about system solutions 91 specify 93 at one extreme no solution can be defined for a system with no information at the other extreme a system with perfect information has a unique solution in the middle grey systems will give a variety of available solutions grey relational analysis does not attempt to find the best solution but does provide techniques for determining a good solution an appropriate solution for real world problems the theory inspired many noted scholars and business leaders like jeffrey yi lin forrest liu sifeng ren zhengfei and joseph l badaracco a professor at harvard business school the theory has been applied in various fields of engineering and management initially the grey method was adapted to effectively study air pollution 91 4 93 and subsequently used to investigate the nonlinear multiple dimensional model of the socio economic activities impact on the city air pollution 91 5 93 it has also been used to study the research output and growth of countries 91 6 93 in the world there are many universities associations and societies promoting grey system theory e g international association of grey systems and decision sciences iagsua chinese grey system association cgsa grey systems society of china gssc grey systems society of pakistan gssp polish scientific society of grey systems psgs grey systems committee ieee systems man and cybernetics society centre for computational intelligence de montfort university etc 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 91 10 93 91 11 93 there are several journals dedicated to grey systems research and studies
