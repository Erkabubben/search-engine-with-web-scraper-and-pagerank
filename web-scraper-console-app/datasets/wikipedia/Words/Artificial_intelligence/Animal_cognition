animal cognition from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search intelligence of non human animals for the scientific journal see animal cognition a crab eating macaque using a stone tool to crack open a nut experiments like the string pulling task performed here by a carib grackle provide insights into animal cognition animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non human animals including insect cognition the study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology it has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used many behaviors associated with the term animal intelligence are also subsumed

edit earliest inferences edit a monkey drinking frooti from a juice box using its hands the mind and behavior of non human animals has captivated the human imagination for centuries many writers such as descartes have speculated about the presence or absence of the animal mind 91 7 93 these speculations led to many observations of animal behavior before modern science and testing were available this ultimately resulted in the creation of multiple hypotheses about animal intelligence one of aesop s fables was the crow and the pitcher in which a crow drops pebbles into a vessel of water until he is able to drink this was a relatively accurate reflection of the capability of corvids to understand water displacement 91 8 93 the roman naturalist pliny the elder was the earliest to attest that said story reflects the behavior of real life corvids 91 9 93 aristotle in his biology hypothesized a causal chain where an animal s sense organs transmitted information to an organ capable of making decisions and then to a motor organ despite aristotle s cardiocentrism mistaken belief that cognition occurred in the heart this approached some modern understandings of information processing 91 10 93 early inferences were not necessarily precise or accurate nonetheless interest in animal mental abilities and comparisons to humans increased with early myrmecology the study of ant behavior as well as the classification of humans as primates beginning with linnaeus morgan s canon edit main article morgan s canon coined by 19th century british psychologist c lloyd morgan morgan s canon remains a fundamental precept of comparative animal psychology in its developed form it states that 91 11 93 in no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development in other words morgan believed that anthropomorphic approaches to animal behavior were fallacious and that people should only consider behaviour as for example rational purposive or affectionate if there is no other explanation in terms of the behaviours of more primitive life forms to which we do not attribute those faculties from anecdote to laboratory edit see also comparative psychology speculation about animal intelligence gradually yielded to scientific study after darwin placed humans and animals on a continuum although darwin s largely anecdotal approach to the cognition topic would not pass scientific muster later on 91 12 93 this method would be expanded by his prot g george j romanes 91 13 93 who played a key role in the defense of darwinism and its refinement over the years still romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism 91 14 93 unsatisfied with the previous approach e l thorndike brought animal behavior into the laboratory for objective scrutiny thorndike s careful observations of the escape of cats dogs and chicks from puzzle boxes led him to conclude that what appears to the naive human observer to be intelligent behavior may be strictly attributable to simple associations according to thorndike using morgan s canon the inference of animal reason insight or consciousness is unnecessary and misleading 91 15 93 at about the same time i p pavlov began his seminal studies of conditioned reflexes in dogs pavlov quickly abandoned attempts to infer canine mental processes such attempts he said led only to disagreement and confusion he was however willing to propose unseen physiological processes that might explain his observations 91 16 93 the behavioristic half century edit the work of thorndike pavlov and a little later of the outspoken behaviorist john b watson 91 17 93 set the direction of much research on animal behavior for more than half a century during this time there was considerable progress in understanding simple associations notably around 1930 the differences between thorndike s instrumental or operant conditioning and pavlov s classical or pavlovian conditioning were clarified first by miller and kanorski and then by b f skinner 91 18 93 91 19 93 many experiments on conditioning followed they generated some complex theories 91 20 93 but they made little or no reference to intervening mental processes probably the most explicit dismissal of the idea that mental processes control behavior was the radical behaviorism of skinner this view seeks to explain behavior including private events like mental images solely by reference to the environmental contingencies impinging on the human or animal 91 21 93 despite the predominantly behaviorist orientation of research before 1960 the rejection of mental processes in animals was not universal during those years influential exceptions included for example wolfgang k hler and his insightful chimpanzees 91 22 93 and edward tolman whose proposed cognitive map was a significant contribution to subsequent cognitive research in both humans and animals 91 23 93 the cognitive revolution edit main article cognitive revolution beginning around 1960 a cognitive revolution in research on humans 91 24 93 gradually spurred a similar transformation of research with animals inference to processes not directly observable became acceptable and then commonplace an important proponent of this shift in thinking was donald o hebb who argued that mind is simply a name for processes in the head that control complex behavior and that it is both necessary and possible to infer those processes from behavior 91 25 93 animals came to be seen as goal seeking agents that acquire store retrieve and internally process information at many levels of cognitive complexity 91 26 93 methods edit the acceleration of research on animal cognition in the last 50 years or so has led to a rapid expansion in the variety of species studied and methods employed the remarkable behavior of large brained animals such as primates and cetacea have claimed special attention but all sorts of animals large and small birds fish ants bees and others have been brought into the laboratory or observed in carefully controlled field studies in the laboratory animals push levers pull strings dig for food swim in water mazes or respond to images on computer screens to get information for discrimination attention memory and categorization experiments 91 27 93 careful field studies explore memory for food caches navigation by stars 91 28 93 communication tool use identification of conspecifics and many other matters studies often focus on the behavior of animals in their natural environments and discuss the putative function of the behavior for the propagation and survival of the species these developments reflect an increased cross fertilization from related fields such as ethology and behavioral ecology contributions from behavioral neuroscience are beginning to clarify the physiological substrate of some inferred mental process some researchers have made effective use of a piagetian methodology taking tasks which human children are known to master at different stages of development and investigating which of them can be performed by particular species others have been inspired by concerns for animal welfare and the management of domestic species for example temple grandin has harnessed her unique expertise in animal welfare and the ethical treatment of farm livestock to highlight underlying similarities between humans and other animals 91 29 93 from a methodological point of view one of the main risks in this sort of work is anthropomorphism the tendency to interpret an animal s behavior in terms of human feelings thoughts and motivations 91 1 93 research questions edit the common chimpanzee can use tools this individual is using a stick to get food human and non human animal cognition have much in common and this is reflected in the research summarized below most of the headings found here might also appear in an article on human cognition of course research in the two also differs in important respects notably much research with humans either studies or involves language and much research with animals is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings following are summaries of some of the major areas of research in animal cognition perception edit animals process information from eyes ears and other sensory organs to perceive the environment perceptual processes have been studied in many species with results that are often similar to those in humans equally interesting are those perceptual processes that differ from or go beyond those found in humans such as echolocation in bats and dolphins motion detection by skin receptors in fish and extraordinary visual acuity motion sensitivity and ability to see ultraviolet light in some birds 91 30 93 attention edit much of what is happening in the world at any moment is irrelevant to current behavior attention refers to mental processes that select relevant information inhibit irrelevant information and switch among these as the situation demands 91 31 93 often the selective process is tuned before relevant information appears such expectation makes for rapid selection of key stimuli when they become available a large body of research has explored the way attention and expectation affect the behavior of non human animals and much of this work suggests that attention operates in birds mammals and reptiles in much the same way that it does in humans 91 32 93 selective learning edit animals trained to discriminate between two stimuli say black versus white can be said to attend to the brightness dimension but this says little about whether this dimension is selected in preference to others more enlightenment comes from experiments that allow the animal to choose from several alternatives for example several studies have shown that performance is better on for example a color discrimination e g blue vs green after the animal has learned another color discrimination e g red vs orange than it is after training on a different dimension such as an x shape versus an o shape the reverse effect happens after training on forms thus the earlier learning appears to affect which dimension color or form the animal will attend to 91 33 93 other experiments have shown that after animals have learned to respond to one aspect of the environment responsiveness to other aspects is suppressed in blocking for example an animal is conditioned to respond to one stimulus a by pairing that stimulus with reward or punishment after the animal responds consistently to a a second stimulus b accompanies a on additional training trials later tests with the b stimulus alone elicit little response suggesting that learning about b has been blocked by prior learning about a 91 34 93 this result supports the hypothesis that stimuli are neglected if they fail to provide new information thus in the experiment just cited the animal failed to attend to b because b added no information to that supplied by a if true this interpretation is an important insight into attentional processing but this conclusion remains uncertain because blocking and several related phenomena can be explained by models of conditioning that do not invoke attention 91 35 93 divided attention edit attention is a limited resource and is not a none or all response the more attention devoted to one aspect of the environment the less is available for others 91 36 93 a number of experiments have studied this in animals in one experiment a tone and a light are presented simultaneously to pigeons the pigeons gain a reward only by choosing the correct combination of the two stimuli e g a high frequency tone together with a yellow light the birds perform well at this task presumably by dividing attention between the two stimuli when only one of the stimuli varies and the other is presented at its rewarded value discrimination improves on the variable stimulus but discrimination on the alternative stimulus worsens 91 37 93 these outcomes are consistent with the notion that attention is a limited resource that can be more or less focused among incoming stimuli visual search and attentional priming edit as noted above the function of attention is to select information that is of special use to the animal visual search typically calls for this sort of selection and search tasks have been used extensively in both humans and animals to determine the characteristics of attentional selection and the factors that control it experimental research on visual search in animals was initially prompted by field observations published by luc tinbergen 1960 91 38 93 tinbergen observed that birds are selective when foraging for insects for example he found that birds tended to catch the same type of insect repeatedly even though several types were available tinbergen suggested that this prey selection was caused by an attentional bias that improved detection of one type of insect while suppressing detection of others this attentional priming is commonly said to result from a pretrial activation of a mental representation of the attended object which tinbergen called a searching image tinbergen s field observations on priming have been supported by a number of experiments for example pietrewicz and kamil 1977 1979 91 39 93 91 40 93 presented blue jays with pictures of tree trunks upon which rested either a moth of species a a moth of species b or no moth at all the birds were rewarded for pecks at a picture showing a moth crucially the probability with which a particular species of moth was detected was higher after repeated trials with that species e g a a a than it was after a mixture of trials e g a b b a b a a these results suggest again that sequential encounters with an object can establish an attentional predisposition to see the object another way to produce attentional priming in search is to provide an advance signal that is associated with the target for example if a person hears a song sparrow he or she may be predisposed to detect a song sparrow in a shrub or among other birds a number of experiments have reproduced this effect in animal subjects 91 41 93 91 42 93 still other experiments have explored nature of stimulus factors that affect the speed and accuracy of visual search for example the time taken to find a single target increases as the number of items in the visual field increases this rise in rt is steep if the distracters are similar to the target less steep if they are dissimilar and may not occur if the distracters are very different from the target in form or color 91 43 93 concepts and categories edit fundamental but difficult to define the concept of concept was discussed for hundreds of years by philosophers before it became a focus of psychological study concepts enable humans and animals to organize the world into functional groups the groups may be composed of perceptually similar objects or events diverse things that have a common function relationships such as same versus different or relations among relations such as analogies 91 44 93 extensive discussions on these matters together with many references may be found in shettleworth 2010 91 1 93 wasserman and zentall 2006 91 27 93 and in zentall et al 2008 the latter is freely available online 91 45 93 methods edit most work on animal concepts has been done with visual stimuli which can easily be constructed and presented in great variety but auditory and other stimuli have been used as well 91 46 93 pigeons have been widely used for they have excellent vision and are readily conditioned to respond to visual targets other birds and a number of other animals have been studied as well 91 1 93 in a typical experiment a bird or other animal confronts a computer monitor on which a large number of pictures appear one by one and the subject gets a reward for pecking or touching a picture of a category item and no reward for non category items alternatively a subject may be offered a choice between two or more pictures many experiments end with the presentation of items never seen before successful sorting of these items shows that the animal has not simply learned many specific stimulus response associations a related method sometimes used to study relational concepts is matching to sample in this task an animal sees one stimulus and then chooses between two or more alternatives one of which is the same as the first the animal is then rewarded for choosing the matching stimulus 91 1 93 91 27 93 91 45 93 perceptual categories edit perceptual categorization is said to occur when a person or animal responds in a similar way to a range of stimuli that share common features for example a squirrel climbs a tree when it sees rex shep or trixie which suggests that it categorizes all three as something to avoid this sorting of instances into groups is crucial to survival among other things an animal must categorize if it is to apply learning about one object e g rex bit me to new instances of that category dogs may bite 91 1 93 91 27 93 91 45 93 natural categories edit many animals readily classify objects by perceived differences in form or color for example bees or pigeons quickly learn to choose any red object and reject any green object if red leads to reward and green does not seemingly much more difficult is an animal s ability to categorize natural objects that vary a great deal in color and form even while belonging to the same group in a classic study richard j herrnstein trained pigeons to respond to the presence or absence of human beings in photographs 91 47 93 the birds readily learned to peck photos that contained partial or full views of humans and to avoid pecking photos with no human despite great differences in the form size and color of both the humans displayed and in the non human pictures in follow up studies pigeons categorized other natural objects e g trees and after training they were able without reward to sort photos they had not seen before 91 48 93 91 49 93 similar work has been done with natural auditory categories for example bird songs 91 50 93 honeybees apis mellifera are able to form concepts of up and down 91 51 93 functional or associative categories edit perceptually unrelated stimuli may come to be responded to as members of a class if they have a common use or lead to common consequences an oft cited study by vaughan 1988 provides an example 91 52 93 vaughan divided a large set of unrelated pictures into two arbitrary sets a and b pigeons got food for pecking at pictures in set a but not for pecks at pictures in set b after they had learned this task fairly well the outcome was reversed items in set b led to food and items in set a did not then the outcome was reversed again and then again and so on vaughan found that after 20 or more reversals associating a reward with a few pictures in one set caused the birds to respond to the other pictures in that set without further reward as if they were thinking if these pictures in set a bring food the others in set a must also bring food that is the birds now categorized the pictures in each set as functionally equivalent several other procedures have yielded similar results 91 1 93 91 45 93 relational or abstract categories edit when tested in a simple stimulus matching to sample task described above many animals readily learn specific item combinations such as touch red if the sample is red touch green if the sample is green but this does not demonstrate that they distinguish between same and different as general concepts better evidence is provided if after training an animal successfully makes a choice that matches a novel sample that it has never seen before monkeys and chimpanzees do learn to do this as do pigeons if they are given a great deal of practice with many different stimuli however because the sample is presented first successful matching might mean that the animal is simply choosing the most recently seen familiar item rather than the conceptually same item a number of studies have attempted to distinguish these possibilities with mixed results 91 1 93 91 45 93 rule learning edit the use of rules has sometimes been considered an ability restricted to humans but a number of experiments have shown evidence of simple rule learning in primates 91 53 93 and also in other animals much of the evidence has come from studies of sequence learning in which the rule consists of the order in which a series of events occurs rule use is shown if the animal learns to discriminate different orders of events and transfers this discrimination to new events arranged in the same order for example murphy et al 2008 91 54 93 trained rats to discriminate between visual sequences for one group aba and bab were rewarded where a bright light and b dim light other stimulus triplets were not rewarded the rats learned the visual sequence although both bright and dim lights were equally associated with reward more importantly in a second experiment with auditory stimuli rats responded correctly to sequences of novel stimuli that were arranged in the same order as those previously learned similar sequence learning has been demonstrated in birds and other animals as well 91 55 93 memory edit the categories that have been developed to analyze human memory short term memory long term memory working memory have been applied to the study of animal memory and some of the phenomena characteristic of human short term memory e g the serial position effect have been detected in animals particularly monkeys 91 56 93 however most progress has been made in the analysis of spatial memory some of this work has sought to clarify the physiological basis of spatial memory and the role of the hippocampus other work has explored the spatial memory of scatter hoarder animals such as clark s nutcracker certain jays tits and certain squirrels whose ecological niches require them to remember the locations of thousands of caches 91 1 93 91 57 93 often following radical changes in the environment memory has been widely investigated in foraging honeybees apis mellifera which use both transient short term working memory that is non feeder specific and a feeder specific long term reference memory 91 58 93 91 59 93 91 60 93 memory induced in a free flying honeybee by a single learning trial lasts for days and by three learning trials for a lifetime 91 61 93 bombus terrestris audax workers vary in their effort investment towards memorising flower locations with smaller workers less able to be selective and thus less interested in which flowers are richer sugar sources 91 62 93 91 63 93 meanwhile bigger b t audax workers have more carrying capacity and thus more reason to memorise that information and so they do 91 62 93 91 63 93 slugs limax flavus have a short term memory of approximately 1 min and long term memory of 1 month 91 64 93 methods edit as in humans research with animals distinguishes between working or short term memory from reference or long term memory tests of working memory evaluate memory for events that happened in the recent past usually within the last few seconds or minutes tests of reference memory evaluate memory for regularities such as pressing a lever brings food or children give me peanuts habituation edit main article habituation this is one of the simplest tests for memory spanning a short time interval the test compares an animal s response to a stimulus or event on one occasion to its response on a previous occasion if the second response differs consistently from the first the animal must have remembered something about the first unless some other factor such as motivation sensory sensitivity or the test stimulus has changed delayed response edit delayed response tasks are often used to study short term memory in animals introduced by hunter 1913 a typical delayed response task presents an animal with a stimulus such a colored light and after a short time interval the animal chooses among alternatives that match the stimulus or are related to the stimulus in some other way in hunter s studies for example a light appeared briefly in one of three goal boxes and then later the animal chose among the boxes finding food behind the one that had been lighted 91 65 93 most research has been done with some variation of the delayed matching to sample task for example in the initial study with this task a pigeon was presented with a flickering or steady light then a few seconds later two pecking keys were illuminated one with a steady light and one with a flickering light the bird got food if it pecked the key that matched the original stimulus 91 66 93 a commonly used variation of the matching to sample task requires the animal to use the initial stimulus to control a later choice between different stimuli for example if the initial stimulus is a black circle the animal learns to choose red after the delay if it is a black square the correct choice is green ingenious variations of this method have been used to explore many aspects of memory including forgetting due to interference and memory for multiple items 91 1 93 radial arm maze edit main article radial arm maze the radial arm maze is used to test memory for spatial location and to determine the mental processes by which location is determined in a radial maze test an animal is placed on a small platform from which paths lead in various directions to goal boxes the animal finds food in one or more goal boxes having found food in a box the animal must return to the central platform the maze may be used to test both reference and working memory suppose for example that over a number of sessions the same 4 arms of an 8 arm maze always lead to food if in a later test session the animal goes to a box that has never been baited this indicates a failure of reference memory on the other hand if the animal goes to a box that it has already emptied during the same test session this indicates a failure of working memory various confounding factors such as odor cues are carefully controlled in such experiments 91 67 93 water maze edit main article morris water navigation task the water maze is used to test an animal s memory for spatial location and to discover how an animal is able to determine locations typically the maze is a circular tank filled with water that has been made milky so that it is opaque located somewhere in the maze is a small platform placed just below the surface of the water when placed in the tank the animal swims around until it finds and climbs up on the platform with practice the animal finds the platform more and more quickly reference memory is assessed by removing the platform and observing the relative amount of time the animal spends swimming in the area where the platform had been located visual and other cues in and around the tank may be varied to assess the animal s reliance on landmarks and the geometric relations among them 91 68 93 novel object recognition test edit the novel object recognition nor test is an animal behavior test that is primarily used to assess memory alterations in rodents it is a simple behavioral test that is based on a rodents innate exploratory behavior the test is divided into three phases habituation training adaptation and test phase during the habituation phase the animal is placed in an empty test arena this is followed by the adaptation phase where the animal is placed in the arena with two identical objects in the third phase the test phase the animal is placed in the arena with one of the familiar objects from the previous phase and with one novel object based on the rodents innate curiosity the animals that remember the familiar object will spend more time on investigating the novel object 91 69 93 spatial cognition edit whether an animal ranges over a territory measured in square kilometers or square meters its survival typically depends on its ability to do such things as find a food source and then return to its nest sometimes such a task can be performed rather simply for example by following a chemical trail typically however the animal must somehow acquire and use information about locations directions and distances the following paragraphs outline some of the ways that animals do this 91 1 93 91 70 93 beacons animals often learn what their nest or other goal looks like and if it is within sight they may simply move toward it it is said to serve as a beacon landmarks when an animal is unable to see its goal it may learn the appearance of nearby objects and use these landmarks as guides researchers working with birds and bees have demonstrated this by moving prominent objects in the vicinity of nest sites causing returning foragers to hunt for their nest in a new location 91 1 93 dead reckoning also known as path integration is the process of computing one s position by starting from a known location and keeping track of the distances and directions subsequently traveled classic experiments have shown that the desert ant keeps track of its position in this way as it wanders for many meters searching for food though it travels in a randomly twisted path it heads straight home when it finds food however if the ant is picked up and released some meters to the east for example it heads for a location displaced by the same amount to the east of its home nest cognitive maps some animals appear to construct a cognitive map of their surroundings meaning that they acquire and use information that enables them to compute how far and in what direction to go to get from one location to another such a map like representation is thought to be used for example when an animal goes directly from one food source to another even though its previous experience has involved only travel between each source and home 91 1 93 91 71 93 research in this area 91 70 93 has also explored such topics as the use of geometric properties of the environment by rats and pigeons and the ability of rats to represent a spatial pattern in either radial arm mazes or water mazes spatial cognition is used in visual search when an animal or human searches their environment for specific objects to focus on among other objects in the environment 91 72 93 detour behaviour some animals appear to have an advanced understanding of their spatial environment and will not take the most direct route if this confers an advantage to them some jumping spiders take an indirect route to prey rather than the most direct route thereby indicating flexibility in behaviour and route planning and possibly insight learning 91 73 93 long distance navigation homing edit main article animal navigation many animals travel hundreds or thousands of miles in seasonal migrations or returns to breeding grounds they may be guided by the sun the stars the polarization of light magnetic cues olfactory cues winds or a combination of these 91 74 93 this extensive area of research is covered in the main article on animal navigation it has been hypothesized that animals such as apes and wolves are good at spatial cognition because this skill is necessary for survival some researchers argue that this ability may have diminished somewhat in dogs because humans have provided necessities such as food and shelter during some 15 000 years of domestication 91 75 93 91 76 93 91 77 93 timing edit further information time perception time of day circadian rhythms edit main article circadian rhythms the behavior of most animals is synchronized with the earth s daily light dark cycle thus many animals are active during the day others are active at night still others near dawn and dusk though one might think that these circadian rhythms are controlled simply by the presence or absence of light nearly every animal that has been studied has been shown to have a biological clock that yields cycles of activity even when the animal is in constant illumination or darkness 91 1 93 circadian rhythms are so automatic and fundamental to living things 160 they occur even in plants 91 78 93 that they are usually discussed separately from cognitive processes and the reader is referred to the main article circadian rhythms for further information 91 79 93 interval timing edit survival often depends on an animal s ability to time intervals for example rufous hummingbirds feed on the nectar of flowers and they often return to the same flower but only after the flower has had enough time to replenish its supply of nectar in one experiment hummingbirds fed on artificial flowers that quickly emptied of nectar but were refilled at some fixed time e g twenty minutes later the birds learned to come back to the flowers at about the right time learning the refill rates of up to eight separate flowers and remembering how long ago they had visited each one 91 80 93 the details of interval timing have been studied in a number of species one of the most common methods is the peak procedure in a typical experiment a rat in an operant chamber presses a lever for food a light comes on a lever press brings a food pellet at a fixed later time say 10 seconds and then the light goes off timing is measured during occasional test trials on which no food is presented and the light stays on on these test trials the rat presses the lever more and more until about 10 sec and then when no food comes gradually stops pressing the time at which the rat presses most on these test trials is taken to be its estimate of the payoff time experiments using the peak procedure and other methods have shown that animals can time short intervals quite exactly can time more than one event at once and can integrate time with spatial and other cues such tests have also been used for quantitative tests of theories of animal timing such as gibbon s scalar expectancy theory set 91 81 93 killeen s behavioral theory of timing 91 82 93 and machado s learning to time model 91 83 93 no one theory has yet gained unanimous agreement 91 1 93 tool and weapon use edit main article tool use by animals although tool use was long assumed to be a uniquely human trait there is now much evidence that many animals use tools including mammals birds fish cephalopods and insects discussions of tool use often involve a debate about what constitutes a tool and they often consider the relation of tool use to the animal s intelligence and brain size mammals edit series of photographs showing a bonobo fishing for termitesa bonobo inserting a stick into a termite moundthe bonobo starts fishing for the termites the bonobo withdraws the stick and begins eating the termites the bonobo eats the termites extracted with the tool tool use has been reported many times in both wild and captive primates particularly the great apes the use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting mammals invertebrates fish collecting honey processing food nuts fruits vegetables and seeds collecting water weapons and shelter research in 2007 shows that chimpanzees in the fongoli savannah sharpen sticks to use as spears when hunting considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans 91 84 93 other mammals that spontaneously use tools in the wild or in captivity include elephants bears cetaceans sea otters and mongooses birds edit several species of birds have been observed to use tools in the wild including warblers parrots egyptian vultures brown headed nuthatches gulls and owls some species such as the woodpecker finch of the galapagos islands use particular tools as an essential part of their foraging behavior however these behaviors are often quite inflexible and cannot be applied effectively in new situations a great many species of birds build nests with a wide range of complexities but although nest building behaviour fulfills the criteria of some definitions of tool use this is not the case with other definitions several species of corvids have been trained to use tools in controlled experiments one species examined extensively under laboratory conditions is the new caledonian crow one individual called betty spontaneously made a wire tool to solve a novel problem she was being tested to see whether she would select a wire hook rather than a straight wire to pull a little bucket of meat out of a well betty tried poking the straight wire at the meat after a series of failures with this direct approach she withdrew the wire and began directing it at the bottom of the well which was secured to its base with duct tape the wire soon became stuck whereupon betty pulled it sideways bending it and unsticking it she then inserted the hook into the well and extracted the meat in all but one of 10 subsequent trials with only straight wire provided she also made and used a hook in the same manner but not before trying the straight wire first 91 85 93 91 86 93 another bird that is highly studied for its intelligence is the african gray parrot american animal behaviorist and psychologist irene pepperberg vindicated that african grays possess cognitive abilities pepperberg used a bird named alex in her trials and was able to prove that parrots could associate sound and meaning demolishing long held theories that birds were only capable of mimicking human voices studies by other researchers have determined that african grays can use deductive reasoning to correctly choose between pairs of boxes containing food and boxes that are empty 91 87 93 until pepperberg began this research in the 1970s few scientists had studied intelligence in parrots and few do today most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys chimpanzees gorillas and dolphins all of which are much more difficult to raise feed and handle 91 88 93 by the late 1980s alex had learned the names of more than 50 different objects five shapes and seven colors he d also learned what same and different mean a step so crucial in human intellectual development 91 89 93 fish edit main article fish intelligence several species of wrasses have been observed using rocks as anvils to crack bivalve scallops urchins and clams shells this behavior was first filmed 91 90 93 in an orange dotted tuskfish choerodon anchorago in 2009 by giacomo bernardi the fish fans sand to unearth the bivalve takes it into its mouth swims several meters to a rock which it then uses as an anvil by smashing the mollusc apart with sideward thrashes of the head this behaviour has also been recorded in a blackspot tuskfish choerodon schoenleinii on australia s great barrier reef yellowhead wrasse halichoeres garnoti in florida and a six bar wrasse thalassoma hardwicke in an aquarium setting these species are at opposite ends of the phylogenetic tree in this family so this behaviour may be a deep seated trait in all wrasses 91 91 93 invertebrates edit main article cephalopod intelligence the world s smartest invertebrate is by far the octopus octopuses can carry out complex tasks such as opening jars to get the contents inside and have remarkable ability to learn new skills from the moment they are born 91 92 93 some cephalopods are known to use coconut shells for protection or camouflage 91 93 93 cephalopod cognitive evolution is hypothesized to have been shaped primarily by predatory and foraging pressures but a challenging mating context may also have played a role 91 92 93 ants of the species conomyrma bicolor pick up stones and other small objects with their mandibles and drop them down the vertical entrances of rival colonies allowing workers to forage for food without competition 91 94 93 reasoning and problem solving edit it is clear that animals of quite a range of species are capable of solving problems that appear to require abstract reasoning 91 95 93 wolfgang k hler s 1917 work with chimpanzees is a famous early example he observed that chimpanzees did not use trial and error to solve problems such as retrieving bananas hung out of reach instead they behaved in a manner that was unwaveringly purposeful spontaneously placing boxes so that they could climb to reach the fruit 91 22 93 modern research has identified similar behavior in animals usually thought of as much less intelligent if appropriate pre training is given 91 96 93 causal reasoning has also been observed in rooks and new caledonian crows 91 97 93 91 98 93 it has been shown that barbados bullfinches loxigilla barbadensis from urbanized areas are better at innovative problem solving tasks than bullfinches from rural environments but that they did not differ in colour discrimination learning 91 99 93 cognitive bias edit main article cognitive bias is the glass half empty or half full a cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment whereby inferences about other individuals or situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion cognitive bias is sometimes illustrated by using answers to the question is the glass half empty or half full choosing half empty is supposed to indicate pessimism whereas choosing half full indicates optimism to test this in animals an individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus a e g a 100 160 hz tone precedes a positive event e g highly desired food is delivered when a lever is pressed by the animal the same individual is trained to anticipate that stimulus b e g a 900 160 hz tone precedes a negative event e g bland food is delivered when the animal presses a lever the animal is then tested by being given an intermediate stimulus c e g a 500 160 hz tone and observing whether the animal presses the lever associated with the positive or negative reward this has been suggested to indicate whether the animal is in a positive or negative mood 91 100 93 in a study that used this approach rats that were playfully tickled responded differently than rats that were simply handled the rats that had been tickled were more optimistic than the handled rats 91 101 93 the authors suggested that they had demonstrated for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model there is some evidence for cognitive bias in a number of species including rats dogs rhesus macaques sheep chicks starlings and honeybees 91 102 93 language edit main articles animal language and human animal communication further information talking animal the modeling of human language in animals is known as animal language research in addition to the ape language experiments mentioned above there have also been more or less successful attempts to teach language or language like behavior to some non primate species including parrots and great spotted woodpeckers arguing from his own results with the animal nim chimpsky and his analysis of others results herbert terrace criticized the idea that chimps can produce new sentences 91 103 93 shortly thereafter louis herman published research on artificial language comprehension in the bottlenosed dolphin herman richards amp wolz 1984 though this sort of research has been controversial especially among cognitive linguists many researchers agree that many animals can understand the meaning of individual words and that some may understand simple sentences and syntactic variations but there is little evidence that any animal can produce new strings of symbols that correspond to new sentences 91 1 93 insight edit see also reason wolfgang k hler is usually credited with introducing the concept of insight into experimental psychology 91 86 93 working with chimpanzees k hler came to dispute edward thorndike s theory that animals must solve problems gradually by trial and error he said that thorndike s animals could only use trial and error because the situation precluded other forms of problem solving he provided chimps with a relatively unstructured situation and he observed sudden ah ha insightful changes of behavior as for example when a chimp suddenly moved a box into position so that it could retrieve a banana 91 104 93 more recently asian elephants elephas maximus were shown to exhibit similar insightful problem solving a male was observed moving a box to a position where it could be stood upon to reach food that had been deliberately hung out of reach 91 105 93 numeracy edit main article number sense in animals a variety of studies indicates that animals are able to use and communicate quantitative information and that some can count in a rudimentary way some examples of this research follow in one study rhesus monkeys viewed visual displays containing for example 1 2 3 or 4 items of different sorts they were trained to respond to them in several ways involving numerical ordering for example touching 1 first 2 second and so on when tested with displays containing items they had never seen before they continued to respond to them in order the authors conclude that monkeys can represent the numerosities 1 to 9 at least on an ordinal scale 91 106 93 ants are able to use quantitative values and transmit this information 91 107 93 91 108 93 for instance ants of several species are able to estimate quite precisely numbers of encounters with members of other colonies on their feeding territories 91 109 93 91 110 93 numeracy has been described in the yellow mealworm beetle tenebrio molitor 91 111 93 and the honeybee 91 112 93 western lowland gorillas given the choice between two food trays demonstrated the ability to choose the tray with more food items at a rate higher than chance after training 91 113 93 in a similar task chimpanzees chose the option with the larger amount of food 91 114 93 salamanders given a choice between two displays with differing amounts of fruit flies used as a food reward reliably choose the display with more flies as shown in a particular experiment 91 115 93 other experiments have been conducted that show animals abilities to differentiate between non food quantities american black bears demonstrated quantity differentiation abilities in a task with a computer screen the bears were trained to touch a computer monitor with a paw or nose to choose a quantity of dots in one of two boxes on the screen each bear was trained with reinforcement to pick a larger or smaller amount during training the bears were rewarded with food for a correct response all bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static non moving dots indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities the bears choosing correctly in congruent number of dots coincided with area of the dots and incongruent number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen not just a larger or smaller retinal image which would indicate they are only judging size 91 116 93 bottlenose dolphins have shown the ability to choose an array with fewer dots compared to one with more dots experimenters set up two boards showing various numbers of dots in a poolside setup the dolphins were initially trained to choose the board with the fewer number of dots this was done by rewarding the dolphin when it chose the board with the fewer number of dots in the experimental trials two boards were set up and the dolphin would emerge from the water and point to one board the dolphins chose the arrays with fewer dots at a rate much larger than chance indicating they can differentiate between quantities 91 117 93 a particular grey parrot after training has shown the ability to differentiate between the numbers zero through six using vocalizations after number and vocalization training this was done by asking the parrot how many objects there were in a display the parrot was able to identify the correct amount at a rate higher than chance 91 118 93 angelfish when put in an unfamiliar environment will group together with conspecifics an action named shoaling given the choice between two groups of differing size the angelfish will choose the larger of the two groups this can be seen with a discrimination ratio of 2 1 or greater such that as long as one group has at least twice the fish as another group it will join the larger one 91 119 93 monitor lizards have been shown to be capable of numeracy and some species can distinguish among numbers up to six 91 120 93 sapience edit main article g factor in non humans as the cognitive ability and intelligence in non human animals cannot be measured with verbal scales it has been measured using a variety of methods that involve such things as habit reversal social learning and responses to novelty principal component analysis and factor analytic studies have shown that a single factor of intelligence is responsible for 47 of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates 91 121 93 and between 55 and 60 of the variance in mice 91 122 93 91 123 93 these values are similar to the accepted variance in iq explained by a similar single factor known as the general factor of intelligence in humans 40 50 91 124 93 however results from a recent meta analysis suggest that the average correlation between performance scores on various cognitive tasks is only 0 18 91 125 93 results from this study suggest that current evidence for general intelligence is weak in non human animals 91 125 93 the general factor of intelligence or g factor is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual s scores on various measures of cognitive abilities it has been suggested that g is related to evolutionary life histories and the evolution of intelligence 91 126 93 as well as to social learning and cultural intelligence 91 127 93 91 128 93 non human models of g have been used in genetic 91 129 93 and neurological 91 130 93 research on intelligence to help understand the mechanisms behind variation in g theory of mind edit main article theory of mind in animals theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states e g intents desires pretending knowledge to oneself and others and to understand that others have desires intentions and perspectives that are different from one s own 91 131 93 some research with ravens provides an example of evidence for theory of mind in a non human species ravens are members of the family corvidae which is widely regarded as having high cognitive abilities these birds have been observed to hide their food when dominant ravens are visible and audible at the same time based on this observation ravens were tested for their understanding of seeing as a mental state in a first step the birds protected their cache when dominants were visible but not when they could only be heard from an adjacent room in the next step they had access to a small peephole which allowed them to see into the adjacent room with the peephole open the ravens guarded their caches against discovery when they could hear dominants in the adjacent room even when the dominant s sounds were playbacks of recordings 91 132 93 consciousness edit main article animal consciousness mirror test with a baboon the sense in which animals can be said to have self consciousness or a self concept has been hotly debated the best known research technique in this area is the mirror test devised by gordon g gallup in which an animal s skin is marked in some way while it is asleep or sedated and it is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behavior towards the mark that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself 91 133 93 91 134 93 self awareness by this criterion has been reported for chimpanzees 91 135 93 91 136 93 and also for other great apes 91 137 93 the european magpie 91 138 93 some cetaceans 91 139 93 91 140 93 91 141 93 and an asian elephant 91 142 93 but not for monkeys the mirror test has been criticized by researchers because it is entirely focused on vision the primary sense in humans while other species rely more heavily on other senses such as the sense of smell in dogs 91 143 93 91 144 93 91 145 93 though generally dismissed in the paleontology community mark mcmenamin published in the 21st century science amp technology that fossils from several dead ichthyosaurs is evidence of an intelligent triassic cephalopod creating a primitive self portrait 91 146 93 it has been suggested that metacognition in some animals provides some evidence for cognitive self awareness 91 147 93 the great apes dolphins and rhesus monkeys have demonstrated the ability to monitor their own mental states and use an i don t know response to avoid answering difficult questions unlike the mirror test which reveals awareness of the condition of one s own body this uncertainty monitoring is thought to reveal awareness of one s internal mental state a 2007 study has provided some evidence for metacognition in rats 91 148 93 91 149 93 although this interpretation has been questioned 91 150 93 91 151 93 these species might also be aware of the strength of their memories some researchers propose that animal calls and other vocal behaviors provide evidence of consciousness this idea arose from research on children s crib talk by weir 1962 and in investigations of early speech in children by greenfield and others 1976 some such research has been done with a macaw see arielle in july 2012 during the consciousness in human and nonhuman animals conference in cambridge a group of scientists announced and signed a declaration with the following conclusions convergent evidence indicates that non human animals have the neuroanatomical neurochemical and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors consequently the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness non human animals including all mammals and birds and many other creatures including octopuses also possess these neurological substrates 91 152 93 biological constraints edit instinctive drift can influence the interpretation of cognitive research instinctive drift is the tendency of an animal to revert to instinctive behaviors that can interfere with learned responses the concept originated with keller and marian breland when they taught a raccoon to put coins into a box the raccoon drifted to its instinctive behavior of rubbing the coins with its paws as it would do when foraging for food 91 153 93 animal ability to process and respond to stimuli is correlated with brain size small brain animals tend to show simple behaviors that are less dependent on learning than those of large brained animals vertebrates particularly mammals have large brains and complex behavior that changes with experience a formula called the encephalization quotient ec expresses a relationship between brain and body size it was developed by h j jerison in the late 1960s 91 154 93 when the encephalization quotient is plotted as a curve an animal with an ec above the curve is expected to show more cognitive ability than the average animal of its size whereas an animal with an ec below the curve is expected to have less various formulas been suggested but the equation ew brain 0 12w body 2 3 has been found to fit data from a sample of mammals 91 155 93 the formula is suggestive at best and should only be applied to non mammals with extreme caution for some of the other vertebrate classes the power of 3 4 rather than 2 3 is sometimes used and for many groups of invertebrates the formula may not give meaningful results experimental evidence against animal cognition edit several experiments cannot be readily reconciled with the belief that some animal species are intelligent insightful or possess a theory of mind jean henri fabre 91 156 93 1823 1915 setting the stage for all subsequent experiments of this kind argued that insects obey their compelling instinct without realizing what they do for instance to understand that she can grab her paralyzed prey by a leg instead of an antenna is utterly beyond the powers of a sand wasp her actions are like a series of echoes each awakening the next in a settled order which allows none to sound until the previous one has sounded fabre s numerous experiments led him in turn to the view that scientists often try to exalt animals instead of objectively studying them c lloyd morgan s 91 157 93 1852 1936 observations suggested to him that prima facie intelligent behavior in animals is often the result of either instincts or trial and error 160 for instance most visitors watching morgan s dog smoothly lifting a latch with the back of its head and thereby opening a garden gate and escaping were convinced that the dog s actions involved thinking morgan however carefully observed the dog s prior random purposeless actions and argued that they involved continued trial and failure until a happy effect is reached rather than methodical planning e l thorndike 91 158 93 1874 1949 placed hungry cats and dogs in enclosures from which they could escape by some simple act such as pulling at a loop of cord their behavior suggested to him that they did not possess the power of rationality most books about animal behavior thorndike wrote do not give us a psychology but rather a eulogy of animals although wolfgang k hler s 91 159 93 experiments are often cited as providing support for the animal cognition hypothesis his book is replete with counterexamples 160 for instance he placed chimpanzees in a situation where they could only get bananas by removing a box 160 the chimpanzee k hler observed has special difficulty in solving such problems he often draws into a situation the strangest and most distant tools and adopts the most peculiar methods rather than remove a simple obstacle which could be displaced with perfect ease daniel j povinelli and timothy eddy 91 160 93 of the university of louisiana showed that chimpanzees when given a choice between two food providers were just as likely to beg food from a person who could see the begging gesture as from a person who could not thereby raising the possibility that chimpanzees do not understand that people see moty nissani 91 161 93 of wayne state university trained burmese logging elephants to lift a lid in order to retrieve food from a bucket the lid was then placed on the ground alongside the bucket where it no longer obstructed access to the food while the treat was simultaneously placed inside the bucket all elephants continued to toss the lid before retrieving the reward thus suggesting that elephants do not grasp simple causal relationships cognitive faculty by species edit a traditionally common image is the scala naturae the ladder of nature on which animals of different species occupy successively higher rungs with humans typically at the top 91 162 93 91 163 93 however there is some disagreement with the use of such a hierarchy with some critics saying it may be necessary to understand specific cognitive capacities as adaptations to differing ecological niches 91 164 93 some biologists argue that humans are not in fact the smartest animal and that no animal can be characterized as the smartest given that some animals have superior cognitive skills in certain areas 91 165 93 91 166 93 this contrasts with evolutionary psychologists such as john tooby who assess based on the large list of related unique characteristics that humans do possess that humans evolved to fill a unique cognitive niche and can fairly be characterized as the smartest animal 91 167 93 whether fairly or not the performance of animals is often compared to that of humans on cognitive tasks not surprisingly our closest biological relatives the great apes tend to perform most like humans among the birds corvids and parrots have typically been found to perform well on human like tasks 91 168 93 some octopodes have also been shown to exhibit a number of higher level skills such as tool use 91 93 93 but the amount of research on cephalopod intelligence is still limited 91 169 93 baboons have been shown to be capable of recognizing words 91 170 93 91 171 93 91 172 93 see also edit anthropomorphism biosemiotics bird intelligence cetacean
