91 3 93 91 4 93 91 5 93 in applying statistics to a scientific industrial or social problem it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as all people living in a country or every atom composing a crystal statistics deals with every aspect of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments 91 6 93 when census data cannot be collected statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation two main statistical methods are used in data analysis descriptive statistics which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation and inferential statistics which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation e g observational errors sampling variation 91 7 93 descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution sample or population central tendency or location seeks to characterize the distribution s central or typical value while dispersion or variability characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory which deals with the analysis of random phenomena a standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model a hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false given the data that are used in the test working from a null hypothesis two basic forms of error are recognized type i errors null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a false positive and type ii errors null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual relationship between populations is missed giving a false negative 91 8 93 multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis 91 7 93 measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors e g blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also occur the presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased

presentation of data 91 9 93 or as a branch of mathematics 91 10 93 some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics while many scientific investigations make use of data statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty 91 11 93 91 12 93 in applying statistics to a problem it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied populations can be diverse topics such as all people living in a country or every atom composing a crystal ideally statisticians compile data about the entire population an operation called census this may be organized by governmental statistical institutes descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data like income while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data like education when a census is not feasible a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied once a sample that is representative of the population is determined data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting again descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data however drawing the sample contains an element of randomness hence the numerical descriptors from the sample are also prone to uncertainty to draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population inferential statistics is needed it uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented while accounting for randomness these inferences may take the form of answering yes no questions about the data hypothesis testing estimating numerical characteristics of the data estimation describing associations within the data correlation and modeling relationships within the data for example using regression analysis inference can extend to forecasting prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data and data mining mathematical statistics edit main article mathematical statistics mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis linear algebra stochastic analysis differential equations and measure theoretic probability theory 91 13 93 91 14 93 history edit main articles history of statistics and founders of statistics bernoulli s ars conjectandi was the first work that dealt with probability theory as currently understood formal discussions on inference date back to arab mathematicians and cryptographers during the islamic golden age between the 8th and 13th centuries al khalil 717 786 wrote the book of cryptographic messages which contains one of the first uses of permutations and combinations to list all possible arabic words with and without vowels 91 15 93 al kindi s manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages providing an early example of statistical inference for decoding ibn adlan 1187 1268 later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis 91 15 93 the earliest writing containing statistics in europe dates back to 1663 with the publication of natural and political observations upon the bills of mortality by john graunt 91 16 93 early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data hence its stat etymology the scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general today statistics is widely employed in government business and natural and social sciences the mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning games of chance among mathematicians such as gerolamo cardano blaise pascal pierre de fermat and christiaan huygens although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy such as the work of juan caramuel probability theory as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the 17th century particularly in jacob bernoulli s posthumous work ars conjectandi 91 17 93 this was the first book where the realm of games of chance and the realm of the probable which concerned opinion evidence and argument were combined and submitted to mathematical analysis 91 18 93 91 19 93 the method of least squares was first described by adrien marie legendre in 1805 though carl friedrich gauss presumably made use of it a decade earlier in 1795 91 20 93 karl pearson a founder of mathematical statistics the modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages 91 21 93 the first wave at the turn of the century was led by the work of francis galton and karl pearson who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis not just in science but in industry and politics as well galton s contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation correlation regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics height weight eyelash length among others 91 22 93 pearson developed the pearson product moment correlation coefficient defined as a product moment 91 23 93 the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the pearson distribution among many other things 91 24 93 galton and pearson founded biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics then called biometry and the latter founded the world s first university statistics department at university college london 91 25 93 the second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by william sealy gosset and reached its culmination in the insights of ronald fisher who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world fisher s most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance which was the first to use the statistical term variance his classic 1925 work statistical methods for research workers and his 1935 the design of experiments 91 26 93 91 27 93 91 28 93 where he developed rigorous design of experiments models he originated the concepts of sufficiency ancillary statistics fisher s linear discriminator and fisher information 91 29 93 he also coined the term null hypothesis during the lady tasting tea experiment which is never proved or established but is possibly disproved in the course of experimentation 91 30 93 91 31 93 in his 1930 book the genetical theory of natural selection he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as fisher s principle 91 32 93 which a w f edwards called probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology and fisherian runaway 91 33 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway effect found in evolution the final wave which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments emerged from the collaborative work between egon pearson and jerzy neyman in the 1930s they introduced the concepts of type ii error power of a test and confidence intervals jerzy neyman in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive quota sampling 91 39 93 today statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology the use of modern computers has expedited large scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data 91 40 93 statistical data edit main article statistical data data collection edit sampling edit when full census data cannot be collected statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models to use a sample as a guide to an entire population it is important that it truly represents the overall population representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole a major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures there are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and more generally the properties of statistical procedures the use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method the difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is roughly that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples statistical inference however moves in the opposite direction inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population experimental and observational studies edit a common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables there are two major types of causal statistical studies experimental studies and observational studies in both types of studies the effect of differences of an independent variable or variables on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed the difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted each can be very effective an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation instead data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated while the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies they are also applied to other kinds of data like natural experiments and observational studies 91 41 93 for which a statistician would use a modified more structured estimation method e g difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables among many others that produce consistent estimators experiments edit the basic steps of a statistical experiment are planning the research including finding the number of replicates of the study using the following information preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects alternative hypotheses and the estimated experimental variability consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary statisticians recommend that experiments compare at least one new treatment with a standard treatment or control to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects design of experiments using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error at this stage the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol further examining the data set in secondary analyses to suggest new hypotheses for future study documenting and presenting the results of the study experiments on human behavior have special concerns the famous hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the hawthorne plant of the western electric company the researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers the researchers first measured the productivity in the plant then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity it turned out that productivity indeed improved under the experimental conditions however the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness the hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome in this case worker productivity changed due to observation itself those in the hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed 91 42 93 observational study edit an example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer this type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis in this case the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non smokers perhaps through a cohort study and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group 91 43 93 a case control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest e g lung cancer are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected types of data edit main articles statistical data type and levels of measurement various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement the psychophysicist stanley smith stevens defined nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values and permit any one to one injective transformation ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values and permit any order preserving transformation interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined but the zero value is arbitrary as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in celsius or fahrenheit and permit any linear transformation ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined and permit any rescaling transformation because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables which can be either discrete or continuous due to their numerical nature such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the boolean data type polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point arithmetic but the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented other categorizations have been proposed for example mosteller and tukey 1977 91 44 93 distinguished grades ranks counted fractions counts amounts and balances nelder 1990 91 45 93 described continuous counts continuous ratios count ratios and categorical modes of data see also chrisman 1998 91 46 93 van den berg 1991 91 47 93 the issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions the relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer 91 48 93 58 8202 82 8202 methods edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to

descriptive statistic in the count noun sense is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information 91 49 93 while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics or inductive statistics in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent inferential statistics edit main article statistical inference statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution 91 50 93 inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates it is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population terminology and theory of inferential statistics edit statistics estimators and pivotal quantities edit consider independent identically distributed iid random variables with a given probability distribution standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these iid variables 91 51 93 the population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters a statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample but not a function of unknown parameters the probability distribution of the statistic though may have unknown parameters consider now a function of the unknown parameter an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function commonly used estimators include sample mean unbiased sample variance and sample covariance a random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot widely used pivots include the z score the chi square statistic and student s t value between two estimators of a given parameter the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient furthermore an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter other desirable properties for estimators include umvue estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter this still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation several methods have been proposed the method of moments the maximum likelihood method the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis edit interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually but not necessarily that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time 91 52 93 91 53 93 the best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial the null hypothesis h0 asserts that the defendant is innocent whereas the alternative hypothesis h1 asserts that the defendant is guilty the indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt the h0 status quo stands in opposition to h1 and is maintained unless h1 is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt however failure to reject h0 in this case does not imply innocence but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict so the jury does not necessarily accept h0 but fails to reject h0 while one can not prove a null hypothesis one can test how close it is to being true with a power test which tests for type ii errors what statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis error edit working from a null hypothesis two broad categories of error are recognized type i errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a false positive type ii errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a false negative standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value such as the sample or population mean while standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean a statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value a residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample also called prediction mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators a widely used class of estimators root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error a least squares fit in red the points to be fitted in blue the fitted line many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares and these are called methods of least squares in contrast to least absolute deviations the latter gives equal weight to small and big errors while the former gives more weight to large errors residual sum of squares is also differentiable which provides a handy property for doing regression least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non linear least squares also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term disturbance or more simply noise both linear regression and non linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable y axis as a function of the independent variable x axis and the deviations errors noise disturbances from the estimated fitted curve measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors e g blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also be important the presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems 91 54 93 interval estimation edit main article interval estimation confidence intervals the red line is true value for the mean in this example the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations most studies only sample part of a population so results don t fully represent the whole population any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population often they are expressed as 95 confidence intervals formally a 95 confidence interval for a value is a range where if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions yielding a different dataset the interval would include the true population value in 95 of all possible cases this does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95 from the frequentist perspective such a claim does not even make sense as the true value is not a random variable either the true value is or is not within the given interval however it is true that before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval the probability is 95 that the yet to be calculated interval will cover the true value at this point the limits of the interval are yet to be observed random variables one approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from bayesian statistics this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by probability that is as a bayesian probability in principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical an interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter left sided interval or right sided interval but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds significance edit main article statistical significance statistics rarely give a simple yes no type answer to the question under analysis interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis sometimes referred to as the p value in this graph the black line is probability distribution for the test statistic the critical region is the set of values to the right of the observed data point observed value of the test statistic and the p value is represented by the green area the standard approach 91 51 93 is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis a critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis the probability of type i error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true statistical significance and the probability of type ii error is the probability that the estimator doesn t belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true the statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms for example in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate the significance level is the largest p value that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis this test is logically equivalent to saying that the p value is the probability assuming the null hypothesis is true of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic therefore the smaller the significance level the lower the probability of committing type i error some problems are usually associated with this framework see criticism of hypothesis testing a difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this one response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the p value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted the p value however does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies a better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p values they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it fallacy of the transposed conditional aka prosecutor s fallacy criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis the null hypothesis to be favored since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result an alternative to this approach is offered by bayesian inference although it requires establishing a prior probability 91 55 93 rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis as everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size and therefore under fat tails p values may be seriously mis computed 91 clarification needed 93 examples edit some well known statistical tests and procedures are analysis of variance anova chi squared test correlation factor analysis mann whitney u mean square weighted deviation mswd pearson product moment correlation coefficient regression analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficient student s t test time series analysis conjoint analysis exploratory data analysis edit main article exploratory data analysis exploratory data analysis eda is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics often with visual methods a statistical model can be used or not but primarily eda is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task misuse edit main article misuse of statistics misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors for instance social policy medical practice and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics even when statistical techniques are correctly applied the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise the statistical significance of a trend in the data which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance the set of basic statistical skills and skepticism that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy there is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all too frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter 91 56 93 a mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional and the book how to lie with statistics 91 56 93 by darrell huff outlines a range of considerations in an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted e g warne lazo ramos and ritter 2012 91 57 93 ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias 91 58 93 misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias 91 59 93 bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs 91 58 93 unfortunately most people do not look for bias or errors so they are not noticed thus people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented 91 59 93 to make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate the sample taken must be representative of the whole 91 60 93 according to huff the dependability of a sample can be destroyed by bias allow yourself some degree of skepticism 91 61 93 to assist in the understanding of statistics huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case 91 56 93 who says so does he she have an axe to grind how does he she know does he she have the resources to know the facts what s missing does he she give us a complete picture did someone change the subject does he she offer us the right answer to the wrong problem does it make sense is his her conclusion logical and consistent with what we already know the confounding variable problem x and y may be correlated not because there is causal relationship between them but because both depend on a third variable z z is called a confounding factor misinterpretation correlation edit see also correlation does not imply causation the concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables properties of the population under consideration tend to vary together as if they were connected for example a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people the two variables are said to be correlated however they may or may not be the cause of one another the correlation phenomena could be caused by a third previously unconsidered phenomenon called a lurking variable or confounding variable for this reason there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables applications edit applied statistics theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics edit applied statistics sometimes referred to as statistical science 91 62 93 comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics 91 63 93 91 64 93 theoretical statistics concerns the

edit gretl an example of an open source statistical package main article computational statistics the rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models but powerful computers coupled with suitable numerical algorithms caused an increased interest in nonlinear models such as neural networks as well as the creation of new types such as generalized linear models and multilevel models increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling such as permutation tests and the bootstrap while techniques such as gibbs sampling have made use of bayesian models more feasible the computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on experimental and empirical statistics a large number of both general and

generally see also business mathematics 160 university level professional certification programs such as the cfa often include topics in statistics statistics applied to mathematics or the arts edit traditionally statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi standardized methodology that was required learning in most sciences 91 71 93 this tradition has changed with the use of statistics in non inferential contexts what was once considered a dry subject taken in many fields as a degree requirement is now viewed enthusiastically 91 according to whom 93 initially derided by some mathematical purists it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas in number theory scatter plots of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns which may then lead to hypotheses predictive methods of statistics in forecasting combining chaos theory and fractal geometry can be used to create video works 91 72 93 the process art of jackson pollock relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed 91 73 93 with the advent of computers statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art 91 citation needed 93 methods of statistics may be used predicatively in performance art as in a card trick based on a markov process that only works some of the time the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology statistics can be used to predicatively create art as in the statistical or stochastic music invented by iannis xenakis where the music is performance specific though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics specialized disciplines edit main article list of fields of application of statistics statistical techniques are used in a wide
