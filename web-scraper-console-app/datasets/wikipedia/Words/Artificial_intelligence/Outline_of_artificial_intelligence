period of time when an exponentially self improving computer is able to increase its capabilities to a superintelligent level recursive self improvement aka seed ai speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent the more intelligent it got the more capable it would be of further improving itself in successively more rapid iterations potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence intelligence explosion through recursive self improvement and self replication the
