law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit ic doubles about every two years moore s law is an observation and projection of a historical trend rather than a law of physics it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production the observation is named after gordon moore the co founder of fairchild semiconductor and intel and former ceo of the latter who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit 91 a 93 and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade in 1975 looking forward to the next decade he revised the forecast to doubling every two years a compound annual growth rate cagr of 41 while moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a law moore s prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long term planning and to set targets for research and development thus functioning to some extent as a self fulfilling prophecy advancements in digital electronics such as the reduction in quality adjusted microprocessor prices the increase in memory capacity ram and flash the improvement of sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras are strongly linked to moore s law these ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change productivity and economic growth industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when moore s law will cease to apply

size publishing his results in the article microelectronics and the art of similitude 91 2 93 91 3 93 91 4 93 engelbart presented his findings at the 1960 international solid state circuits conference where moore was present in the audience 91 5 93 in 1965 gordon moore who at the time was working as the director of research and development at fairchild semiconductor was asked to contribute to the thirty fifth anniversary issue of electronics magazine with a prediction on the future of the semiconductor components industry over the next ten years his response was a brief article entitled cramming more components onto integrated circuits 91 1 93 91 6 93 91 b 93 within his editorial he speculated that by 1975 it would be possible to contain as many as 65 000 components on a single quarter square inch 1 6 square centimeter semiconductor the complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue if not to increase over the longer term the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years 91 1 93 moore posited a log linear relationship between device complexity higher circuit density at reduced cost and time 91 9 93 91 10 93 in a 2015 interview moore noted of the 1965 article i just did a wild extrapolation saying it s going to continue to double every year for the next 10 years 91 11 93 one historian of the law cites stigler s law of eponymy to introduce the fact that the regular doubling of components was known to many working in the field 91 10 93 in 1974 robert h dennard at ibm recognized the rapid mosfet scaling technology and formulated what became known as dennard scaling which describes that as mos transistors get smaller their power density stays constant such that the power use remains in proportion with area 91 12 93 91 13 93 evidence from the semiconductor industry shows that this inverse relationship between power density and areal density broke down in the mid 2000s 91 14 93 at the 1975 ieee international electron devices meeting moore revised his forecast rate 91 15 93 91 16 93 predicting semiconductor complexity would continue to double annually until about 1980 after which it would decrease to a rate of doubling approximately every two years 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 he outlined several contributing factors for this exponential behavior 91 9 93 91 10 93 the advent of metal oxide semiconductor mos technology the exponential rate of increase in die sizes coupled with a decrease in defective densities with the result that semiconductor manufacturers could work with larger areas without losing reduction yields finer minimum dimensions what moore called circuit and device cleverness shortly after 1975 caltech professor carver mead popularized the term moore s law 91 19 93 91 20 93 moore s law eventually came to be widely accepted as a goal for the semiconductor industry and it was cited by competitive semiconductor manufacturers as they strove to increase processing power moore viewed his eponymous law as surprising and optimistic moore s law is a violation of murphy s law everything gets better and better 91 21 93 the observation was even seen as a self fulfilling prophecy 91 22 93 91 23 93 the doubling period is often misquoted as 18 months because of a prediction by moore s colleague intel executive david house in 1975 house noted that moore s revised law of doubling transistor count every 2 years in turn implied that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months 91 24 93 with no increase in power consumption 91 25 93 mathematically moore s law predicted that transistor count would double every 2 years due to shrinking transistor dimensions and other improvements as a consequence of shrinking dimensions dennard scaling predicted that power consumption per unit area would remain constant combining these effects david house deduced that computer chip performance would roughly double every 18 months also due to dennard scaling this increased performance would not be accompanied by increased power i e the energy efficiency of silicon based computer chips roughly doubles every 18 months dennard scaling ended in the 2000s 91 14 93 koomey later showed that a similar rate of efficiency improvement predated silicon chips and moore s law for technologies such as vacuum tubes an osborne executive portable computer from 1982 with a zilog z80 4 160 mhz cpu and a 2007 apple iphone with a 412 160 mhz arm11 cpu the executive has 100 times the weight almost 500 times the volume approximately 10 times the inflation adjusted cost and 1 103rd the clock frequency of the smartphone microprocessor architects report that since around 2010 semiconductor advancement has slowed industry wide below the pace predicted by moore s law 91 14 93 brian krzanich the former ceo of intel cited moore s 1975 revision as a precedent for the current deceleration which results from technical challenges and is a natural part of the history of moore s law 91 26 93 91 27 93 91 28 93 the rate of improvement in physical dimensions known as dennard scaling also ended in the mid 2000s as a result much of the semiconductor industry has shifted its focus to the needs of major computing applications rather than semiconductor scaling 91 22 93 91 29 93 91 14 93 nevertheless leading semiconductor manufacturers tsmc and samsung electronics have claimed to keep pace with moore s law 91 30 93 91 31 93 91 32 93 91 33 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 with 10 160 nm and 7 160 nm nodes in mass production 91 30 93 91 31 93 and 5 160 nm nodes in risk production as of 2019 91 update 93 91 36 93 91 37 93 moore s second law edit further information moore s second law as the cost of computer power to the consumer falls the cost for producers to fulfill moore s law follows an opposite trend r amp d manufacturing and test costs have increased steadily with each new generation of chips rising manufacturing costs are an important consideration for the sustaining of moore s law 91 38 93 this led to the formulation of moore s second law also called rock s law which is that the capital cost of a semiconductor fabrication plant also increases exponentially over time 91 39 93 91 40 93 major enabling factors edit see also list of semiconductor scale examples and transistor count the trend of mosfet scaling for nand flash memory allows the doubling of floating gate mosfet components manufactured in the same wafer area in less than 18 months numerous innovations by scientists and engineers have sustained moore s law since the beginning of the ic era some of the key innovations are listed below as examples of breakthroughs that have advanced integrated circuit and semiconductor device fabrication technology allowing transistor counts to grow by more than seven orders of magnitude in less than five decades integrated circuit ic the raison d tre for moore s law the germanium hybrid ic was invented by jack kilby at texas instruments in 1958 91 41 93 followed by the invention of the silicon monolithic ic chip by robert noyce at fairchild semiconductor in 1959 91 42 93 complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos the cmos process was invented by chih tang sah and

chemically amplified photoresist for dram production in the mid 1980s 91 51 93 91 52 93 deep uv excimer laser photolithography invented by kanti jain 91 53 93 at ibm circa 1980 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 prior to this excimer lasers had been mainly used as research devices since their development in the 1970s 91 57 93 91 58 93 from a broader scientific perspective the invention of excimer laser lithography has been highlighted as one of the major milestones in the 50 year history of the laser 91 59 93 91 60 93 interconnect innovations interconnect innovations of the late 1990s including chemical mechanical polishing or chemical mechanical planarization cmp trench isolation and copper interconnects although not directly a factor in creating smaller transistors have enabled improved wafer yield additional layers of metal wires closer spacing of devices and lower electrical resistance 91 61 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 computer industry technology road maps predicted in 2001 that moore s law would continue for several generations of semiconductor chips 91 64 93 recent trends edit a simulation of electron density as gate voltage vg varies in a nanowire mosfet the threshold voltage is around 0 45 160 v nanowire mosfets lie toward the end of the itrs road map for scaling devices below 10 160 nm gate lengths one of the key challenges of engineering future nanoscale transistors is the design of gates as device dimension shrinks controlling the current flow in the thin channel becomes more difficult modern nanoscale transistors typically take the form of multi gate mosfets with the finfet being the most common nanoscale transistor the finfet has gate dielectric on three sides of the channel in comparison the gate all around mosfet gaafet structure has even better gate control a gate all around mosfet gaafet was first demonstrated in 1988 by a toshiba research team led by fujio masuoka who demonstrated a vertical nanowire gaafet which he called a surrounding gate transistor sgt 91 65 93 91 66 93 masuoka best known as the inventor of flash memory later left toshiba and founded unisantis electronics in 2004 to research surrounding gate technology along with tohoku university 91 67 93 in 2006 a team of korean researchers from the korea advanced institute of science and technology kaist and the national nano fab center developed a 3 160 nm transistor the world s smallest nanoelectronic device at time based on finfet technology 91 68 93 91 69 93 in 2010 researchers at the tyndall national institute in cork ireland announced a junctionless transistor a control gate wrapped around a silicon nanowire can control the passage of electrons without the use of junctions or doping they claim these may be produced at 10 nm scale using existing fabrication techniques 91 70 93 in 2011 researchers at the university of pittsburgh announced the development of a single electron transistor 1 5 160 nm in diameter made out of oxide based materials three wires converge on a central island that can house one or two electrons electrons tunnel from one wire to another through the island conditions on the third wire result in distinct conductive properties including the ability of the transistor to act as a solid state memory 91 71 93 nanowire transistors could spur the creation of microscopic computers 91 72 93 91 73 93 91 74 93 in 2012 a research team at the university of new south wales announced the development of the first working transistor consisting of a single atom placed precisely in a silicon crystal not just picked from a large sample of random transistors 91 75 93 moore s law predicted this milestone to be reached for ics in the lab by 2020 in 2015 ibm demonstrated 7 160 nm node chips with silicon germanium transistors produced using euvl the company believes this transistor density would be four times that of current 14 160 nm chips 91 76 93 samsung and tsmc plan to manufacture 3 160 nm gaafet nodes by 2021 2022 91 77 93 91 78 93 note that node names such as 3 160 nm have no relation to the physical size of device elements transistors a toshiba research team including t imoto m matsui and c takubo developed a system block module wafer bonding process for manufacturing three dimensional integrated circuit 3d ic packages in 2001 91 79 93 91 80 93 in april 2007 toshiba introduced an eight layer 3d ic the 16 160 gb thgam embedded nand flash memory chip which was manufactured with eight stacked 2 160 gb nand flash chips 91 81 93 in september 2007 hynix introduced 24 layer 3d ic a 16 160 gb flash memory chip that was manufactured with 24 stacked nand flash chips using a wafer bonding process 91 82 93 v nand also known as 3d nand allows flash memory cells to be stacked vertically using charge trap flash technology originally presented by john szedon in 1967 significantly increasing the number of transistors on a flash memory chip 3d nand was first announced by toshiba in 2007 91 83 93 v nand was first commercially manufactured by samsung electronics in 2013 91 84 93 91 85 93 91 86 93 in 2008 researchers at hp labs announced a working memristor a fourth basic passive circuit element whose existence only had been theorized previously the memristor s unique properties permit the creation of smaller and better performing electronic devices 91 87 93 in 2014 bioengineers at stanford university developed a circuit modeled on the human brain sixteen neurocore chips simulate one million neurons and billions of synaptic connections claimed to be 9 000 times faster as well as more energy

31 93 91 needs update 93 in may 2021 ibm announces the creation of the first 2 nm computer chip with parts supposedly being smaller than human dna 91 95 93 microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry wide since around 2010 below the pace predicted by moore s law 91 14 93 brian krzanich the former ceo of intel announced our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two 91 96 93 intel stated in 2015 that improvements in mosfet devices have slowed starting at the 22 160 nm feature width around 2012 and continuing at 14 160 nm 91 97 93 the physical limits to transistor scaling have been reached due to source to drain leakage limited gate metals and limited options for channel material other approaches are being investigated which do not rely on physical scaling these include the spin state of electron spintronics tunnel junctions and advanced confinement of channel materials via nano wire geometry 91 98 93 spin based logic and memory options are being developed actively in labs 91 99 93 91 100 93 alternative materials research edit the vast majority of current transistors on ics are composed principally of doped silicon and its alloys as silicon is fabricated into single nanometer transistors short channel effects adversely change desired material properties of silicon as a functional transistor below are several non silicon substitutes in the fabrication of small nanometer transistors one proposed material is indium gallium arsenide or ingaas compared to their silicon and germanium counterparts ingaas transistors are more promising for future high speed low power logic applications because of intrinsic characteristics of iii v compound semiconductors quantum well and tunnel effect transistors based on ingaas have been proposed as alternatives to more traditional mosfet designs in the early 2000s the atomic layer deposition high film and pitch double patterning processes were invented by gurtej singh sandhu at micron technology extending moore s law for planar cmos technology to 30 160 nm class and smaller in 2009 intel announced the development of 80 nm ingaas quantum well transistors quantum well devices contain a material sandwiched between two layers of material with a wider band gap despite being double the size of leading pure silicon transistors at the time the company reported that they performed equally as well while consuming less power 91 101 93 in 2011 researchers at intel demonstrated 3 d tri gate ingaas transistors with improved leakage characteristics compared to traditional planar designs the company claims that their design achieved the best electrostatics of any iii v compound semiconductor transistor 91 102 93 at the 2015 international solid state circuits conference intel mentioned the use of iii v compounds based on such an architecture for their 7 160 nm node 91 103 93 91 104 93 in 2011 researchers at the university of texas at austin developed an ingaas tunneling field effect transistors capable of higher operating currents than previous designs the first iii v tfet designs were demonstrated in 2009 by a joint team from cornell university and pennsylvania state university 91 105 93 91 106 93 in 2012 a team in mit s microsystems technology laboratories developed a 22 160 nm transistor based on ingaas which at the time was the smallest non silicon transistor ever built the team used techniques currently used in silicon device fabrication and aims for better electrical performance and a reduction to 10 nanometer scale 91 107 93 biological computing research shows that biological material has superior information density and energy efficiency compared to silicon based computing 91 108 93 scanning probe microscopy image of graphene in its hexagonal lattice structure various forms of graphene are being studied for graphene electronics e g graphene nanoribbon transistors have shown great promise since its appearance in publications in 2008 bulk graphene has a band gap of zero and thus cannot be used in transistors because of its constant conductivity an inability to turn off the zigzag edges of the nanoribbons introduce localized energy states in the conduction and valence bands and thus a bandgap that enables switching when fabricated as a transistor as an example a typical gnr of width of 10 160 nm has a desirable bandgap energy of 0 4 160 ev 91 109 93 91 110 93 more research will need to be performed however on sub 50 160 nm graphene layers as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases 91 109 93 forecasts and roadmaps edit in april 2005 gordon moore stated in an interview that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely it can t continue forever the nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens he also noted that transistors eventually would reach the limits of miniaturization at atomic levels in terms of size of transistors you can see that we re approaching the size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier but it ll be two or three generations before we get that far but that s as far out as we ve ever been able to see we have another 10 to 20 years before we reach a fundamental limit by then they ll be able to make bigger chips and have transistor budgets in the billions 91 111 93 in 2016 the international technology roadmap for semiconductors after using moore s law to drive the industry since 1998 produced its final roadmap it no longer centered its research and development plan on moore s law instead it outlined what might be called the more than moore strategy in which the needs of applications drive chip development rather than a focus on semiconductor scaling application drivers range from smartphones to ai to data centers 91 112 93 ieee began a road mapping initiative in 2016 rebooting computing named the international roadmap for devices and systems irds 91 113 93 most forecasters including gordon moore 91 114 93 expect moore s law will end by around 2025 91 115 93 91 112 93 91 116 93 although moore s law will reach a physical limitation some forecasters are optimistic about the continuation of technological progress in a variety of other areas including new chip architectures quantum computing and ai and machine learning 91 117 93 91 118 93 nvidia ceo jensen huang declared moore s law dead in 2022 91 119 93 several days later intel ceo pat gelsinger declared that moore s law is not dead 91 120 93 consequences edit digital electronics have contributed to world economic growth in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries 91 121 93 the primary driving force of economic growth is the growth of productivity 91 122 93 and moore s law factors into productivity moore 1995 expected that the rate of technological progress is going to be controlled from financial realities 91 123 93 the reverse could and did occur around the late 1990s however with economists reporting that productivity growth is the key economic indicator of innovation 91 124 93 moore s law describes a driving force of technological and social change productivity and economic growth 91 125 93 91 126 93 91 122 93 an acceleration in the rate of semiconductor progress contributed to a surge in u s productivity growth 91 127 93 91 128 93 91 129 93 which reached 3 4 per year in 1997 2004 outpacing the 1 6 per year during both 1972 1996 and 2005 2013 91 130 93 as economist richard g anderson notes numerous studies have traced the cause of the productivity acceleration to technological innovations in the production of semiconductors that sharply reduced the prices of such components and of the products that contain them as well as expanding the capabilities of such products 91 131 93 the primary negative implication of moore s law is that obsolescence pushes society up against the limits to growth as technologies continue to rapidly improve they render predecessor technologies obsolete in situations in which security and survivability of hardware or data are paramount or in which resources are limited rapid obsolescence often poses obstacles to smooth or continued operations 91 132 93 because of the intensive resource footprint and toxic materials used in the production of computers obsolescence leads to serious harmful environmental impacts americans throw out 400 000 cell phones every day 91 133 93 but this high level of obsolescence appears to companies as an opportunity to generate regular sales of expensive new equipment instead of retaining one device for a longer period of time leading to industry using planned obsolescence as a profit centre 91 134 93 intel transistor gate length trend transistor scaling has slowed down significantly at advanced smaller nodes an alternative source of improved performance is in microarchitecture techniques exploiting the growth of available transistor count out of order execution and on chip caching and prefetching reduce the memory latency bottleneck at the expense of using more transistors and increasing the processor complexity these increases are described empirically by pollack s rule which states that performance increases due to microarchitecture techniques approximate the square root of the complexity number of transistors or the area of a processor 91 135 93 for years processor makers delivered increases in clock rates and instruction level parallelism so that single threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification 91 136 93 now to manage cpu power dissipation processor makers favor multi core chip designs and software has to be written in a multi threaded manner to take full advantage of the hardware many multi threaded development paradigms introduce overhead and will not see a linear increase in speed vs number of processors this is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources due to lock contention this effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases there are cases where a roughly 45 increase in processor transistors has translated to roughly 10 20 increase in processing power 91 137 93 on the other hand manufacturers are adding specialized processing units to deal with features such as graphics video and cryptography for one example intel s parallel javascript extension not only adds support for multiple cores but also for the other non general processing features of their chips as part of the migration in client side scripting toward html5 91 138 93 moore s law has affected the performance of other technologies significantly michael s malone wrote of a moore s war following the apparent success of shock and awe in the early days of the iraq war progress in the development of guided weapons depends on electronic technology 91 139 93 improvements in circuit density and low power operation associated with moore s law also have contributed to the development of technologies including mobile telephones 91 140 93 and 3 d printing 91 141 93 other formulations and similar observations edit several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to moore s law including the size cost density and speed of components moore wrote only about the density of components a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor 91 123 93 at minimum cost transistors per integrated circuit the most popular formulation is of the doubling of the number of transistors on ics every two years at the end of the 1970s moore s law became known as the limit for the number of transistors on the most complex chips the graph at the top shows this trend holds true today as of 2017 the commercially available processor possessing the highest number of transistors is the 48 core centriq with over 18 160 billion transistors 91 142 93 density at minimum cost per transistor edit this is the formulation given in moore s 1965 paper 91 1 93 it is not just about the density of transistors that can be achieved but about the density of transistors at which the cost per transistor is the lowest 91 143 93 as more transistors are put on a chip the cost to make each transistor decreases but the chance that the chip will not work due to a defect increases in 1965 moore examined the density of transistors at which cost is minimized and observed that as transistors were made smaller through advances in photolithography this number would increase at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year 91 1 93 dennard scaling this posits that power usage would decrease in proportion to area both voltage and current being proportional to length of transistors combined with moore s law performance per watt would grow at roughly the same rate as transistor density doubling every 1 2 years according to dennard scaling transistor dimensions would be scaled by 30 0 7x every technology generation thus reducing their area by 50 this would reduce the delay by 30 0 7x and therefore increase operating frequency by about 40 1 4x finally to keep electric field constant voltage would be reduced by 30 reducing energy by 65 and power at 1 4x frequency by 50 91 c 93 therefore in every technology generation transistor density would double circuit becomes 40 faster while power consumption with twice the number of transistors stays the same 91 144 93 dennard scaling came to end in 2005 2010 due to leakage currents 91 14 93 the exponential processor transistor growth predicted by moore does not always translate into exponentially greater practical cpu performance since around 2005 2007 dennard scaling has ended so even though moore s law continued for several years after that it has not yielded dividends in improved performance 91 12 93 91 145 93 the primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes current leakage poses greater challenges and also causes the chip to heat up which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore further increases energy costs 91 12 93 91 145 93 91 14 93 the breakdown of dennard scaling prompted a greater focus on multicore processors but the gains offered by switching to more cores are lower than the gains that would be achieved had dennard scaling continued 91 146 93 91 147 93 in another departure from dennard scaling intel microprocessors adopted a non planar tri gate finfet at 22 160 nm in 2012 that is faster and consumes less power than a conventional planar transistor 91 148 93 the rate of performance improvement for single core microprocessors has slowed significantly 91 149 93 single core performance was improving by 52 per year in 1986 2003 and 23 per year in 2003 2011 but slowed to just seven percent per year in 2011 2018 91 149 93 quality adjusted price of it equipment the price of information technology it computers and peripheral equipment adjusted for quality and inflation declined 16 per year on average over the five decades from 1959 to 2009 91 150 93 91 151 93 the pace accelerated however to 23 per year in 1995 1999 triggered by faster it innovation 91 124 93 and later slowed to 2 per year in 2010 2013 91 150 93 91 152 93 while quality adjusted microprocessor price improvement continues 91 153 93 the rate of improvement likewise varies and is not linear on a log scale microprocessor price improvement accelerated during the late 1990s reaching 60 per year halving every nine months versus the typical 30 improvement rate halving every two years during the years earlier and later 91 154 93 91 155 93 laptop microprocessors in particular improved 25 35 per year in 2004 2010 and slowed to 15 25 per year in 2010 2013 91 156 93 the number of transistors per chip cannot explain quality adjusted microprocessor prices fully 91 154 93 91 157 93 91 158 93 moore s 1995 paper does not limit moore s law to strict linearity or to transistor count the definition of moore s law has come to refer to almost anything related to the semiconductor industry that on a semi log plot approximates a straight line i hesitate to review its origins and by doing so restrict its definition 91 123 93 hard disk drive areal density a similar prediction sometimes called kryder s law was made in 2005 for hard disk drive areal density 91 159 93 the prediction was later viewed as over optimistic several decades of rapid progress in areal density slowed around 2010 from 30 100 per year to 10 15 per year because of noise related to smaller grain size of the disk media thermal stability and writability using available magnetic fields 91 160 93 91 161 93 fiber optic capacity the number of bits per second that can be sent down an optical fiber increases exponentially faster than moore s law keck s law in honor of donald keck 91 162 93 network capacity according to gerald butters 91 163 93 91 164 93 the former head of lucent s optical networking group at bell labs there is another version called butters law of photonics 91 165 93 a formulation that deliberately parallels moore s law butters law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months 91 166 93 thus the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months the availability of wavelength division multiplexing sometimes called wdm increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100 optical networking and dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking and further progress seems assured as a result the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot com bubble nielsen s law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50 annually 91 167 93 pixels per dollar similarly barry hendy of kodak australia has plotted pixels per dollar as a basic measure of value for a digital camera demonstrating the historical linearity on a log scale of this market and the opportunity to predict the future trend of digital camera price lcd and led screens and resolution 91 168 93 91 169 93 91 170 93 91 171 93 the great moore s law compensator tgmlc also known as wirth s law generally is referred to as software bloat and is the principle that successive generations of computer software increase in size and complexity thereby offsetting the performance gains predicted by moore s law in a 2008 article in infoworld randall c kennedy 91 172 93 formerly of intel introduces this term using successive versions of microsoft office between the year 2000 and 2007 as his premise despite the gains in computational performance during this time period according to moore s law office 2007 performed the same task at half the speed on a prototypical year 2007 computer as compared to office 2000 on a year 2000 computer library expansion was calculated in 1945 by fremont rider to double in capacity every 16 years if sufficient space were made available 91 173 93 he advocated replacing bulky decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs which could be duplicated on demand for library patrons or other institutions he did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging storage and transmission media automated potentially lossless digital technologies allowed vast increases in the rapidity of information growth in an era that now sometimes is called the information age carlson curve is a term coined by the economist 91 174 93 to describe the biotechnological equivalent of moore s law and is named after author rob carlson 91 175 93 carlson accurately predicted that the doubling time of dna sequencing technologies measured by cost and performance would be at least as fast as moore s law 91 176 93 carlson curves illustrate the rapid in some cases hyperexponential decreases in cost and increases in performance of a variety of technologies including dna sequencing dna synthesis and a range of physical and computational tools used in protein expression and in determining protein structures eroom s law is a pharmaceutical drug development observation which was deliberately written as moore s law spelled backwards in order to contrast it with the exponential advancements of other forms of technology such as transistors over time it states that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years experience curve effects says that each doubling of the cumulative production of virtually any product or service is accompanied by an approximate constant percentage reduction in the unit cost the acknowledged first documented qualitative description of this dates from 1885 91 177 93 91 178 93 a power curve was used to describe this phenomenon in a 1936 discussion of the cost of airplanes 91 179 93 edholm s law phil edholm observed that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks including the internet is doubling every 18 months 91 180 93 the bandwidths of online communication networks has risen from bits per second to terabits per second the rapid rise in online bandwidth is largely due to the same mosfet scaling that enables moore s law as telecommunications networks are built from mosfets 91 181 93 haitz s law predicts that the brightness of leds increases as their manufacturing cost goes down swanson s law is the observation that the price of solar photovoltaic modules tends to drop 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative shipped volume at present rates costs go down 75
