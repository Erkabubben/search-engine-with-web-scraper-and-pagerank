results page 91 53 93 91 54 93 marissa mayer then vice president of search products and user experience described the goal of universal search as we re attempting to break down the walls that

swiping left on the home screen of certain android devices as of 2019 google will not allow political campaigns worldwide to target their advertisement to people to make them vote 91 76 93 safe search main article safesearch ranking of results pagerank main article pagerank google s rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called pagerank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string 91 77 93 when google was a stanford research project it was nicknamed backrub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site s importance other keyword based methods to rank search results used by many search engines that were once more popular than google would check how often the search terms occurred in a page or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page the pagerank algorithm instead analyzes human generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are also important the algorithm computes a recursive score for pages based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them pagerank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance in addition to pagerank google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of resulting pages this is reported to comprise over 250 different indicators 91 78 93 91 79 93 the specifics of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by scammers and help google maintain an edge over its competitors globally pagerank was influenced by a similar page ranking and site scoring algorithm earlier used for rankdex developed by robin li in 1996 larry page s patent for pagerank filed in 1998 includes a citation to li s earlier patent li later went on to create the chinese search engine baidu in 2000 91 80 93 91 81 93 91 82 93 in a potential hint of google s future direction of their search algorithm google s then chief executive eric schmidt said in a 2007 interview with the financial times the goal is to enable google users to be able to ask the question such as what shall i do tomorrow and what job shall i take 91 83 93 schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with the wall street journal i actually think most people don t want google to answer their questions they want google to tell them what they should be doing next 91 84 93 in 2013 the european commission found that google search favored google s own products instead of the best result for consumers needs 91 85 93 in february 2015 google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites nearly 60 of google searches come from mobile phones google says it wants users to have access to premium quality websites those websites which lack a mobile friendly interface would be ranked lower and it is expected that this update will cause a shake up of ranks businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic 91 86 93 google optimization main article search engine optimization because google is the most popular search engine many webmasters attempt to influence their website s google rankings an industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on google and other search engines this field called search engine optimization attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients sites search engine optimization encompasses both on page factors like body copy title elements h1 heading elements and image alt attribute values and off page optimization factors like anchor text and pagerank the general idea is to affect google s relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places on page in particular the title element and the body copy note the higher up in the page presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking too many occurrences of the keyword however cause the page to look suspect to google s spam checking algorithms google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants 91 87 93 it has been hypothesized and allegedly is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints that negative publicity for example numerous consumer complaints may serve as well to elevate page rank on google search as favorable comments 91 88 93 the particular problem addressed in the new york times article which involved decormyeyes was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the google algorithm according to google it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about decormyeyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it google search console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content 91 89 93 hummingbird search algorithm upgrade main article google hummingbird in 2013 google significantly upgraded its search algorithm with hummingbird its name was derived from the speed and accuracy of the hummingbird 91 90 93 the change was announced on september 26 2013 having already been in use for a month 91 91 93 hummingbird places greater emphasis on natural language queries considering context and meaning over individual keywords 91 90 93 it also looks deeper at content on individual pages of a website with improved ability to lead users directly to the most appropriate page rather than just a website s homepage 91 92 93 the upgrade marked the most significant change to google search in years with more human search interactions 91 93 93 and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning 91 90 93 thus web developers and writers were encouraged to optimize their sites with natural writing rather than forced keywords and make effective use of technical web development for on site navigation 91 94 93 google doodles main article google doodle on certain occasions the logo on google s webpage will change to a special version known as a google doodle this is a picture drawing animation or interactive game that includes the logo it is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known 91 95 93 clicking on the doodle links to a string of google search results about the topic the first was a reference to the burning man festival in 1998 91 96 93 91 97 93 and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like albert einstein historical events like the interlocking lego block s 50th anniversary and holidays like valentine s day 91 98 93 some google doodles have interactivity beyond a simple search such as the famous google pac man version that appeared on may 21 2010 smartphone apps google offers a google search mobile app for android and ios devices 91 99 93 the mobile apps exclusively feature google discover and a collections feature in which the user can save for later perusal any type of search result like images bookmarks or map locations into groups 91 100 93 android devices were introduced to a preview of the feed perceived as related to google now in december 2016 91 101 93 while it was made official on both android and ios in july 2017 91 102 93 91 103 93 in april 2016 google updated its search app on android to feature trends search queries gaining popularity appeared in the autocomplete box along with normal query autocompletion 91 104 93 the update received significant backlash due to encouraging search queries unrelated to users interests or intentions prompting the company to issue an update with an opt out option 91 105 93 in september 2017 the google search app on ios was updated to feature the same functionality 91 106 93 in december 2017 google released google go an app designed to enable use of google search on physically smaller and lower spec devices in multiple languages a google blog post about designing india first products and features explains that it is tailor made for the millions of people in india and indonesia coming online for the first time 91 107 93 discontinued features translate foreign pages until may 2013 google search had offered a feature to translate search queries into other languages a google spokesperson told search engine land that removing features is always tough but we do think very hard about each decision and its implications for our users unfortunately this feature never saw much pick up 91 108 93 instant search instant search was announced in september 2010 as a feature that displayed suggested results while the user typed in their search query initially only in select countries or to registered users 91 109 93 the primary advantage of the new system was its ability to save time with marissa mayer then vice president of search products and user experience proclaiming that the feature would save 2 5 seconds per search elaborating that that may not seem like a lot at first but it adds up with google instant we estimate that we ll save our users 11 hours with each passing second 91 110 93 matt van wagner of search engine land wrote that personally i kind of like google instant and i think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works and also praised google s efforts in public relations writing that with just a press conference and a few well placed interviews google has parlayed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention grabbing front page news story 91 111 93 the upgrade also became notable for the company switching google search s underlying technology from html to ajax 91 112 93 instant search could be disabled via google s preferences menu for those who didn t want its functionality 91 113 93 the publication 2600 the hacker quarterly compiled a list of words that google instant did not show suggested results for with a google spokesperson giving the following statement to mashable 91 114 93 there are several reasons you may not be seeing search queries for a particular topic among other things we apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography violence and hate speech it s important to note that removing queries from autocomplete is a hard problem and not as simple as blacklisting particular terms and phrases in search we get more than one billion searches each day because of this we take an algorithmic approach to removals and just like our search algorithms these are imperfect we will continue to work to improve our approach to removals in autocomplete and are listening carefully to feedback from our users our algorithms look not only at specific words but compound queries based on those words and across all languages so for example if there s a bad word in russian we may remove a compound word including the transliteration of the russian word into english we also look at the search results themselves for given queries so for example if the results for a particular query seem pornographic our algorithms may remove that query from autocomplete even if the query itself wouldn t otherwise violate our policies this system is neither perfect nor instantaneous and we will continue to work to make it better pc magazine discussed the inconsistency in how some forms of the same topic are allowed for instance lesbian was blocked while gay was not and cocaine was blocked while crack and heroin were not the report further stated that seemingly normal words were also blocked due to pornographic innuendos most notably scat likely due to having two completely separate contextual meanings one for music and one for a sexual practice 91 115 93 on july 26 2017 google removed instant results due to a growing number of searches on mobile devices where interaction with search as well as screen sizes differ significantly from a computer 91 116 93 91 117 93 instant previews instant previews allowed previewing screenshots of search results web pages without having to open them the feature was introduced in november 2010 to the desktop website and removed in april 2013 citing low usage 91 118 93 91 119 93 dedicated encrypted search page various search engines provide encrypted web search facilities in may 2010 google rolled out ssl encrypted web search 91 120 93 the encrypted search was accessed at encrypted google com 91 121 93 however the web search is encrypted via transport layer security tls by default today thus every search request should be automatically encrypted if tls is supported by the web browser 91 122 93 on its support website google announced that the address encrypted google com would be turned off april 30 2018 stating that all google products and most new browsers use https connections as the reason for the discontinuation 91 123 93 real time search google real time search was a feature of google search in which search results also sometimes included real time information from sources such as twitter facebook blogs and news websites 91 124 93 the feature was introduced on december 7 2009 91 125 93 and went offline on july 2 2011 after the deal with twitter expired 91 126 93 real time search included facebook status updates beginning on february 24 2010 91 127 93 a feature similar to real time search was already available on microsoft s bing search engine which showed results from twitter and facebook 91 128 93 the interface for the engine showed a live descending river of posts in the main region which could be paused or resumed while a bar chart metric of the frequency of posts containing a certain search term or hashtag was located on the right hand corner of the page above a list of most frequently reposted posts and outgoing links hashtag search links were also supported as were promoted tweets hosted by twitter located persistently on top of the river and thumbnails of retweeted image or video links in january 2011 geolocation links of posts were made available alongside results in real time search in addition posts containing syndicated or attached shortened links were made searchable by the link query option in july 2011 real time search became inaccessible with the real time link in the google sidebar disappearing and a custom 404 error page generated by google returned at its former url google originally suggested that the interruption was temporary and related to the launch of google 91 129 93 they subsequently announced that it was due to the expiry of a commercial arrangement with twitter to provide access to tweets 91 130 93 privacy main article privacy concerns regarding google this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it march 2012 searches made by search engines including google leave traces this raises concerns about privacy in principle if details of a user s searches are found those with access to the information principally state agencies responsible for law enforcement and similar matters can make deductions about the user s activities this has been used for the detection and prosecution of lawbreakers for example a murderer was found and convicted after searching for terms such as tips with killing with a baseball bat 91 131 93 a search may leave traces both on a computer used to make the search and in records kept by the search provider when using a search engine through a browser program on a computer search terms and other information may be stored on the computer by default unless the browser is set not to do this or they are erased saved terms may be discovered on forensic analysis of the computer an internet service provider isp or search engine provider e g google may store records which relate search terms to an ip address and a time 91 132 93 whether such logs are kept and access to them by law enforcement agencies is subject to legislation in different jurisdictions and working practices the law may mandate prohibit or say nothing about logging of various types of information some search engines located in jurisdictions where it is not illegal make a feature of not storing user search information 91 133

smiling happy teenagers they also searched for three asian teenagers and very revealing photos of asian girls and women appeared benjamin concluded that these results reflect human prejudice and views on different ethnic groups a group of analysts explained the concept of a racist computer program the idea here is that computers unlike people can t be racist but we re increasingly learning that they do in fact take after their makers 160 some experts believe that this problem might stem from the hidden biases in the massive piles of data that the algorithms process as they learn to recognize patterns 160 reproducing our worst values 91 160 93 trademark main article google verb as people talk about googling rather than searching the company has taken some steps to defend its trademark in
