content discovery platform decision support system music genome project product finder research grouplens research movielens netflix prize vte a recommender system or a recommendation system sometimes replacing system with a synonym such as platform or engine is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user 91 1 93 91 2 93 typically the suggestions refer to various decision making processes such as what product to purchase what music to listen to or what online news to read 91 1 93 recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer 91 1 93 91 3 93 recommender systems are used in a variety of areas with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services product recommenders for online stores or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders 91 4 93 91 5 93 these systems can operate using a single input like music or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news books and search queries there are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts 91 6 93 collaborators 91 7 93 and

both collaborative filtering and content based filtering also known as the personality based approach 91 9 93 as well as other systems such as knowledge based systems collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user s past behavior items previously purchased or selected and or numerical ratings given to those items as well as similar decisions made by other users this model is then used to predict items or ratings for items that the user may have an interest in 91 10 93 content based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete pre tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties 91 11 93 we can demonstrate the differences between collaborative and content based filtering by comparing two early music recommender systems last fm and pandora radio last fm creates a station of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users last fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user s library but are often played by other users with similar interests as this approach leverages the behavior of users it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique 91 12 93 pandora uses the properties of a song or artist a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the music genome project to seed a station that plays music with similar properties user feedback is used to refine the station s results deemphasizing certain attributes when a user dislikes a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user likes a song this is an example of a content based approach each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses in the above example last fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations this is an example of the cold start problem and is common in collaborative filtering systems 91 13 93 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 whereas pandora needs very little information to start it is far more limited in scope for example it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed recommender systems are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise of note recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non traditional data recommender systems have been the focus of several granted patents 91 19 93 91 20 93 91 21 93 91 22 93 91 23 93 history edit elaine rich created 1979 unknowingly the first recommender systems grundy 91 24 93 91 25 93 she looked for a way to recommend a user a book he might like her idea was to create a system that asks the user specific questions and assigns him stereotypes depending on his answers depending on a users stereotype he would then get a recommendation for a book he might like the first actual mention of recommender system was in a technical report as a digital bookshelf in 1990 by jussi karlgren at columbia university 91 26 93 and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by jussi karlgren then at sics 91 27 93 a 91 28 93 and research groups led by pattie maes at mit 91 29 93 will hill at bellcore 91 30 93 and paul resnick also at mit 91 31 93 91 3 93 whose work with grouplens was awarded the 2010 acm software systems award montaner provided the first overview of recommender systems from an intelligent agent perspective 91 32 93 adomavicius provided a new alternate overview of recommender systems 91 33 93 herlocker provides an additional overview of evaluation techniques for recommender systems 91 34 93 and beel et al discussed the problems of offline evaluations 91 35 93 beel et al have also provided literature surveys on available research paper recommender systems and existing challenges 91 36 93 91 37 93 approaches edit collaborative filtering edit main article collaborative filtering an example of collaborative filtering based on a rating system one approach to the design of recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative filtering 91 38 93 collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past the system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items by locating peer users items with a rating history similar to the current user or item they generate recommendations using this neighborhood collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory based and model based a well known example of memory based approaches is the user based algorithm 91 39 93 while that of model based approaches is matrix factorization recommender systems 91 40 93 a key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an understanding of the item itself many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems for example the k nearest neighbor k nn approach 91 41 93 and the pearson correlation as first implemented by allen 91 42 93 when building a model from a user s behavior a distinction is often made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection examples of explicit data collection include the following asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale asking a user to search asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite presenting two items to a user and asking him her to choose the better one of them asking a user to create a list of items that he she likes see rocchio classification or other similar techniques examples of implicit data collection include the following observing the items that a user views in an online store analyzing item user viewing times 91 43 93 keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his her computer analyzing the user s social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems cold start scalability and sparsity 91 44 93 cold start for a new user or item there isn t enough data to make accurate recommendations note one commonly implemented solution to this problem is the multi armed bandit algorithm 91 45 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 91 16 93 91 18 93 scalability there are millions of users and products in many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations thus a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations sparsity the number of items sold on major e commerce sites is extremely large the most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database thus even the most popular items have very few ratings one of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item to item collaborative filtering people who buy x also buy y an algorithm popularized by amazon com s recommender system 91 46 93 many social networks originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends groups and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends 91 1 93 collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems content based filtering edit another common approach when designing recommender systems is content based filtering content based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user s preferences 91 47 93 91 48 93 these methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item name location description etc but not on the user content based recommenders treat recommendation as a user specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user s likes and dislikes based on an item s features in this system keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes in other words these algorithms try to recommend items similar to those that a user liked in the past or is examining in the present it does not rely on a user sign in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile in particular various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best matching items are recommended this approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research to create a user profile the system mostly focuses on two types of information 1 a model of the user s preference 2 a history of the user s interaction with the recommender system basically these methods use an item profile i e a set of discrete attributes and features characterizing the item within the system to abstract the features of the items in the system an item presentation algorithm is applied a widely used algorithm is the tf idf representation also called vector space representation 91 49 93 the system creates a content based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features the weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as bayesian classifiers cluster analysis decision trees and artificial neural networks in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item 91 50 93 a key issue with content based filtering is whether the system can learn user preferences from users actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types when the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended for example recommending news articles based on news browsing is useful still it would be much more useful when music videos products discussions etc from different services can be recommended based on news browsing to overcome this most content based recommender systems now use some form of the hybrid system content based recommender systems can also include opinion based recommender systems in some cases users are allowed to leave text reviews or feedback on the items these user generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resources of both feature aspects of the item and users evaluation sentiment to the item features extracted from the user generated reviews are improved meta data of items because as they also reflect aspects of the item like meta data extracted features are widely concerned by the users sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users rating scores on the corresponding features popular approaches of opinion based recommender system utilize various techniques including text mining information retrieval sentiment analysis see also multimodal sentiment analysis and deep learning 91 51 93 hybrid recommendations approaches edit most recommender systems now use a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering content based filtering and other approaches there is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways by making content based and collaborative based predictions separately and then combining them by adding content based capabilities to a collaborative based approach and vice versa or by unifying the approaches into one model see 91 33 93 for a complete review of recommender systems several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches these methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in knowledge based approaches 91 52 93 netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems 91 53 93 the website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users i e collaborative filtering as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly content based filtering some hybridization techniques include weighted combining the score of different recommendation components numerically switching choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one mixed recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation feature combination features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm 91 54 93 feature augmentation computing a feature or set of features which is then part of the input to the next technique 91 54 93 cascade recommenders are given strict priority with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones meta level one recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model which is then the input used by the next technique 91 55 93 technologies edit session based recommender systems edit these recommender systems use the interactions of a user within a session 91 56 93 to generate recommendations session based recommender systems are used at youtube 91 57 93 and amazon 91 58 93 these are particularly useful when history such as past clicks purchases of a user is not available or not relevant in the current user session domains where session based recommendations are particularly relevant include video e commerce travel music and more most instances of session based recommender systems rely on the sequence of recent interactions within a session without requiring any additional details historical demographic of the user techniques for session based recommendations are mainly based on generative sequential models such as recurrent neural networks 91 56 93 91 59 93 transformers 91 60 93 and other deep learning based approaches 91 61 93 91 62 93 reinforcement learning for recommender systems edit the recommendation problem can be seen as a special instance of a reinforcement learning problem whereby the user is the environment upon which the agent the recommendation system acts upon in order to receive a reward for instance a click or engagement by the user 91 57 93 91 63 93 91 64 93 one aspect of reinforcement learning that is of particular use in the area of recommender systems is the fact that the models or policies can be learned by providing a reward to the recommendation agent this is in contrast to traditional learning techniques which rely on supervised learning approaches that are less flexible reinforcement learning recommendation techniques allow to potentially train models that can be optimized directly on metrics of engagement and user interest 91 65 93 multi criteria recommender systems edit multi criteria recommender systems mcrs can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value the overall preference of user u for the item i these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value several researchers approach mcrs as a multi criteria decision making mcdm problem and apply mcdm methods and techniques to implement mcrs systems 91 66 93 see this chapter 91 67 93 for an extended introduction risk aware recommender systems edit the majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications it is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances for instance during a professional meeting early morning or late at night therefore the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process one option to manage this issue is drars a system which models the context aware recommendation as a bandit problem this system combines a content based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm 91 68 93 mobile recommender systems edit further information location based recommendation mobile recommender systems make use of internet accessing smart phones to offer personalized context sensitive recommendations this is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with it is heterogeneous noisy requires spatial and temporal auto correlation and has validation and generality problems 91 69 93 there are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results the context the recommendation method and privacy 91 70 93 additionally mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem recommendations may not apply in all regions for instance it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available one example of a mobile recommender system are the approaches taken by companies such as uber and lyft to generate driving routes for taxi drivers in a city 91 69 93 this system uses gps data of the routes that taxi drivers take while working which includes location latitude and longitude time stamps and operational status with or without passengers it uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits the netflix prize edit one of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the netflix prize from 2006 to 2009 netflix sponsored a competition offering a grand prize of 1 000 000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10 more accurate than those offered by the company s existing recommender system this competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms on 21 september 2009 the grand prize of us 1 000 000 was given to the bellkor s pragmatic chaos team using tiebreaking rules 91 71 93 the most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches blended into a single prediction as stated by the winners bell et al 91 72 93 predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches rather than refining a single technique consequently our solution is an ensemble of many methods many benefits accrued to the web due to the netflix project some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets some members from the team that finished second place founded gravity r amp d a recommendation engine that s active in the recsys community 91 71 93 91 73 93 4 tell inc created a netflix project derived solution for ecommerce websites a number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by netflix for the netflix prize competition although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy in 2007 two researchers from the university of texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the internet movie database 91 74 93 as a result in december 2009 an anonymous netflix user sued netflix in doe v netflix alleging that netflix had violated united states fair trade laws and the video privacy protection act by releasing the datasets 91 75 93 this as well as concerns from the federal trade commission led to the cancellation of a second netflix prize competition in 2010 91 76 93 evaluation edit performance measures edit evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms to measure the effectiveness of recommender systems and compare different approaches three types of evaluations are available user studies online evaluations a b tests and offline evaluations 91 35 93 the commonly used metrics are the mean squared error and root mean squared error the latter having been used in the netflix prize the information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or dcg are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method diversity novelty and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation 91 77 93 however many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized 91 78 93 evaluating the performance of a recommendation algorithm on a fixed test dataset will always be extremely challenging as it is impossible to accurately predict the reactions of real users to the recommendations hence any metric that computes the effectiveness of an algorithm in offline data will be imprecise user studies are rather a small scale a few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches and then the users judge which recommendations are best in a b tests recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations the effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as conversion rate or click through rate offline evaluations are based on historic data e g a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies 91 79 93 the effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users ratings in the dataset while a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie such information is not available in all domains for instance in the domain of citation recommender systems users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article in such cases offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness for instance it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article s reference list however this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers 91 80 93 91 81 93 91 82 93 91 35 93 for instance it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or a b tests 91 82 93 91 83 93 a dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms 91 84 93 often results of so called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user satisfaction 91 85 93 this is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module 91 80 93 91 86 93 researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically 91 87 93 beyond accuracy edit typically research on recommender systems is concerned with finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms however there are a number of factors that are also important diversity users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra list diversity e g items from different artists 91 88 93 91 89 93 recommender persistence in some situations it is more effective to re show recommendations 91 90 93 or let users re rate items 91 91 93 than showing new items there are several reasons for this users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time for instance because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully privacy recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns 91 92 93 because users have to reveal sensitive information building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view many european countries have a strong culture of data privacy and every attempt to introduce any level of user profiling can result in a negative customer response much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space the netflix prize is particularly notable for the detailed personal information released in its dataset ramakrishnan et al have conducted an extensive overview of the trade offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset 91 93 93 user demographics beel et al found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations 91 94 93 in their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users robustness when users can participate in the recommender system the issue of fraud must be addressed 91 95 93 serendipity serendipity is a measure of how surprising the recommendations are 91 96 93 91 89 93 for instance a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy serendipity serves two purposes first the chance that users lose interest because the choice set is too uniform decreases second these items are needed for algorithms to learn and improve themselves 91 97 93 trust a recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system 91 98 93 trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations and why it recommends an item labelling user satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations 91 99 93 for instance in the cited study click through rate ctr for recommendations labeled as sponsored were lower ctr 5 93 than ctr for identical recommendations labeled as organic ctr 8 86 recommendations with no label performed best ctr 9 87 in that study reproducibility edit recommender systems are notoriously difficult to evaluate offline with some researchers claiming that this has led to a reproducibility crisis in recommender systems publications a recent survey of a small number of selected publications applying deep learning or neural methods to the top k recommendation problem published in top conferences sigir kdd www recsys ijcai has shown that on average less than 40 of articles could be reproduced by the authors of the survey with as little as 14 in some conferences overall the studies identify 26 articles only 12 of them could be reproduced by the authors and 11 of them could be outperformed by much older and simpler properly tuned baselines on off line evaluation metrics the articles considers a number of potential problems in today s research scholarship and suggests improved scientific practices in that area 91 100 93 91 101 93 91 102 93 more recent work on benchmarking a set of the same methods came to qualitatively very different results 91 103 93 whereby neural methods were found to be among the best performing methods deep learning and neural methods for recommender systems have been used in the winning solutions in several recent recommender system challenges wsdm 91 104 93 recsys challenge 91 105 93 moreover neural and deep learning methods are widely used in industry where they are extensively tested 91 106 93 91 57 93 91 58 93 the topic of reproducibility is not new in recommender systems by 2011 ekstrand konstan et al criticized that it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results and that evaluations are not handled consistently 91 107 93 konstan and adomavicius conclude that the recommender systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge often because the research lacks the evaluation to be properly judged and hence to provide meaningful contributions 91 108 93 as a consequence much research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible 91 109 93 hence operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems said amp bellog n conducted a study of papers published in the field as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results even when the same algorithms and data sets were used 91 110 93 some researchers demonstrated that minor variations in the recommendation algorithms or scenarios led to strong changes in the effectiveness of a recommender system they conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation 91 109 93 1 survey other research fields and learn from them 2 find a common understanding of reproducibility 3 identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility 4 conduct more comprehensive experiments 5 modernize publication practices 6 foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks and 7
