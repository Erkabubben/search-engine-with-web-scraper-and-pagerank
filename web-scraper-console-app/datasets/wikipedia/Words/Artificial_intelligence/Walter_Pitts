author of the cognitive science paper what the frog s eye tells the frog s brain 1959 walter harry pitts jr 23 april 1923 160 14 may 1969 was a logician who worked in the field of computational neuroscience 91 1 93 he proposed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity and generative processes that influenced diverse fields such as cognitive sciences and psychology philosophy neurosciences computer science artificial neural networks cybernetics and artificial intelligence together with what has come to be known as the generative sciences he is best remembered for having written along with warren mcculloch a seminal paper in scientific history titled a logical calculus of ideas immanent in nervous activity 1943 this paper proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network the unit of this model a simple formalized neuron is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks it is often called a mcculloch pitts neuron prior to that paper he formalized his ideas regarding the fundamental steps to building a turing machine in the bulletin of mathematical biophysics in an essay titled some observations on the simple neuron circuit contents

april 23 1923 the son of walter and marie n e welsia he was an autodidact who taught himself logic and mathematics and was able to read several languages including greek and latin his father and brothers were rough uneducated and regarded walter as a freak he is widely remembered for having spent three days in a library at the age of 12 reading principia mathematica and sent a letter to bertrand russell pointing out what he considered serious problems with the first half of the first volume russell was appreciative and invited him to study at cambridge university at age 12 the offer was not taken up however pitts did decide to become a logician at age 15 he ran away from home and from that time he refused to speak of his family academic career edit pitts probably continued to correspond with bertrand russell and at the age of 15 he attended russell s lectures at the university of chicago 91 1 93 91 2 93 he stayed there without registering as a student while there in 1938 he met jerome lettvin a pre medical student and the two became close friends 91 3 93 russell was a visiting professor at the university of chicago in the fall of 1938 and he directed pitts to study with the logician rudolf carnap 91 3 93 pitts met carnap at chicago by walking into his office during office hours and presenting him with an annotated version of carnap s recent book on logic the logical syntax of language 91 4 93 since pitts did not introduce himself carnap spent months searching for him and when he found him he obtained for him a menial job at the university and had pitts study with him pitts at the time was homeless and without income 91 5 93 he mastered carnap s abstract logic then met with and was intrigued by the work of the russian mathematical physicist nicolas rashevsky who was also at chicago and was the founder of mathematical biophysics remodeling biology on the structure of the physical sciences and mathematical logic 91 6 93 pitts also worked closely with the mathematician alston scott householder who was a member of rashevsky s group 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 during his studies under carnap pitts was also a regular attendant at nicolas rashevsky s seminars in theoretical biology which included frank offner herbert landahl alston householder and the neuroanatomist gerhardt von bonin from the university of illinois at chicago in 1940 von bonin introduced lettvin to warren mcculloch who would become a professor of psychiatry at illinois in 1941 warren mcculloch took a position as professor of psychiatry at the university of illinois at chicago and in early 1942 he invited pitts who was still homeless together with lettvin to live with his family 91 10 93 in the evenings mcculloch and pitts collaborated pitts was familiar with the work of gottfried leibniz on computing and they considered the question of whether the nervous system could be considered a kind of universal computing device as described by leibniz this led to their seminal neural networks paper a logical calculus of ideas immanent in nervous activity after five years of unofficial studies the university of chicago awarded pitts an associate of arts his only earned degree for his work on the paper 91 11 93 in 1943 lettvin introduced pitts to norbert wiener at the massachusetts institute of technology their first meeting where they discussed wiener s proof of the ergodic theorem went so well that pitts moved to greater boston to work with wiener while pitts was an unofficial student under the aegis of wiener at mit until their acrimonious parting in 1952 he formally enrolled as a graduate student in the physics department during the 1943 1944 academic year and in the electrical engineering computer science department from 1956 1958 91 11 93 91 12 93 in 1944 pitts was hired by kellex corporation later acquired in 1950 by vitro corporation in new york city part of the atomic energy project 91 13 93 from 1946 pitts was a core member and involved with the macy conferences whose principal purpose was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind personal life emotional trauma and decline edit in 1951 wiener convinced jerome wiesner to hire some physiologists of the nervous system a group was established with pitts lettvin mcculloch and pat wall pitts wrote a large dissertation on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions lettvin described him as in no uncertain sense the genius of the group when you asked him a question you would get back a whole textbook pitts never married 91 1 93 pitts was also described as an eccentric refusing to allow his name to be made publicly available he continued to refuse all offers of advanced degrees or positions of authority at mit in part as he would have to sign his name in 1952 wiener suddenly turned against mcculloch his wife margaret wiener hated mcculloch 91 14 93 and broke off relations with anyone connected to him including pitts 91 14 93 although he remained employed as a research associate in the research laboratory of electronics at mit as little more than a technicality 91 15 93 for the rest of his life pitts became increasingly socially isolated in 1959 the paradigmatic what the frog s eye tells the frog s brain credited to humberto maturana lettvin mcculloch and pitts conclusively demonstrated that analog processes in the eye were doing at least part of the interpretive work in image processing as opposed to the brain computing information digital neuron by digital neuron using the exacting implement of mathematical logic leading pitts to burn his unpublished doctoral dissertation on probabilistic three dimensional neural networks and years of unpublished research he took little further interest in work excepting only a collaboration with lettvin and robert gesteland which produced a paper on olfaction in 1965 pitts died in 1969 of bleeding esophageal varices a condition usually associated with cirrhosis and alcoholism 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 14 93 publications edit walter pitts some observations on the simple neuron circuit bulletin of mathematical biology volume 4 number 3 121 129 1942

about the reunion wiener s wife margaret wiener was by all accounts a controlling conservative prude and she despised mcculloch s influence on her husband mcculloch hosted wild get togethers at his family farm in old lyme connecticut where ideas roamed free and everyone went skinny dipping it had been one thing when mcculloch was in chicago but now he was coming to cambridge and margaret wouldn t have it and so she invented a story she sat wiener down and informed him that when their daughter barbara had stayed at mcculloch s house in chicago several of his boys had seduced her wiener
