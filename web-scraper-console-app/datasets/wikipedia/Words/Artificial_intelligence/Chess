more chancenoneskillsstrategy tactics chess is a board game between two players it is sometimes called international chess or western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi chinese chess and shogi japanese chess the current form of the game emerged in spain and the rest of southern europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga a similar but much older game of indian origin today chess is one of the world s most popular games played by millions of people worldwide chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information it is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight by eight grid at the start each player controls sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns the player controlling the white pieces moves first followed by the player controlling the black pieces the object of the game is to checkmate the opponent s king whereby the king is under immediate attack in check and there is no way for it to escape there are also several ways a game can end in a draw organized chess arose in the 19th century chess competition today is governed internationally by fide the international chess federation the first universally recognized world chess champion wilhelm steinitz claimed his title in 1886 magnus carlsen is the current world champion a huge body of chess theory has developed since the game s inception aspects of art are found in chess composition and chess in its turn influenced western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics computer science and psychology one of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess playing machine in 1997 deep blue became the first computer to beat the reigning world champion in a match when it defeated garry kasparov today s chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory

bishop queen king bishop knight and rook second row pawns setup at the start of a chess game chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets while the sets might not be literally white and black e g the light set may be a yellowish or off white color the dark set may be brown or red they are always referred to as white and black the players of the sets are referred to as white and black respectively each set consists of 16 pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns chess sets come in a wide variety of styles for competition the staunton pattern is preferred the game is played on a square board of eight rows called ranks and eight columns called files by convention the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares common colors for chessboards are white and brown or white and dark green the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo thus on white s first rank from left to right the pieces are placed in the following order rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight rook on the second rank is placed a row of eight pawns black s position mirrors white s with an equivalent piece on the same file the board is placed with a light square at the right hand corner nearest to each player the correct positions of the king and queen may be remembered by the phrase queen on her own color i e the white queen begins on a light square and the black queen on a dark square in competitive games the piece colors are allocated to players by the organizers in informal games the colors are usually decided randomly for example by a coin toss or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose movement white moves first after which players alternate turns moving one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved a piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent s piece which is captured and removed from play with the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent s piece occupies moving is compulsory a player may not skip a turn even when having to move is detrimental each piece has its own way of moving in the diagrams the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece s of either color except the knight which leaps over any intervening pieces all pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is located on a square to which they would be able to move if the square was unoccupied the squares on which pawns can capture enemy pieces are marked in the diagram with black crosses moves of the king abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh moves of a rook abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh moves of a

king moves one square in any direction there is also a special move called castling that involves moving the king and a rook the king is the most valuable piece attacks on the king must be immediately countered and if this is impossible immediate loss of the game ensues see check and checkmate below a rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file but cannot leap over other pieces along with the king a rook is involved during the king s castling move a bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but cannot leap over other pieces a queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank file or diagonal but cannot leap over other pieces a knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal thus the move forms an l shape two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically the knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces a pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram a pawn can capture an opponent s piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square black crosses it cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file a pawn has two special moves the en passant capture and promotion check and checkmate when a king is under immediate attack it is said to be in check a move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check this can involve capturing the checking piece interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen rook or bishop and there is a square between it and the king or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack castling is not a permissible response to a check 91 1 93 the object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponent s king is in check and there is no legal way to get it out of check it is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player s own king in check in casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponent s king in check but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments 91 2 93 abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghthe black king is in check by the rook abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghwhite is in checkmate being unable to escape attack by the bishop on f3 32 castling main article castling examples of castling view animation once per game each king can make a move known as castling castling consists of moving the king two squares toward a rook of the same color on the same rank and then placing the rook on the square that the king crossed castling is permissible if the following conditions are met 91 1 93 neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game there are no pieces between the king and the rook the king is not in check and does not pass through or land on any square attacked by an enemy piece castling is still permitted if the rook is under attack or if the rook crosses an attacked square for castling notation see notation en passant main article en passant examples of pawn moves left promotion right en passant when a pawn makes a two step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent s pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file then the opponent s pawn can capture it en passant in passing moving to the square the pawn passed over this can be done only on the turn immediately following the enemy pawn s two square advance otherwise the right to do so is forfeited for example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5 and the white pawn on f5 can take it en passant on g6 but only immediately after the black pawn s advance promotion main article promotion chess when a pawn advances to its eighth rank as part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player s choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion in the animated diagram the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted there is no restriction on the piece promoted to so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game e g two or more queens if the required piece is not available e g a second queen an inverted rook is sometimes used as a substitute but this is not recognized in fide sanctioned games end of the game win a game can be won in the following ways checkmate the king is in check and the player has no legal move see check and checkmate above resignation a player may resign conceding the game to the opponent 91 3 93 most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in a hopeless position 91 4 93 91 5 93 win on time in games with a time control a player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has a superior position as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue forfeit a player who cheats violates the rules or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited occasionally both players are forfeited 91 1 93 draw there are several ways a game can end in a draw stalemate if the player to move has no legal move but is not in check the position is a stalemate and the game is drawn dead position if neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves the game is drawn for example if only the kings are on the board all other pieces having been captured checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule on the other hand if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply the dead position rule supersedes the previous rule which referred to insufficient material extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns cannot be attacked draw by agreement in tournament chess draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players the correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make a move then start the opponent s clock traditionally players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing a move in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty threefold repetition this most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage in this situation either player can claim a draw this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged the three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid the addition of the fivefold repetition rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game a draw after five occurrences of the same position consecutive or otherwise without requiring a claim by either player fide rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition fifty move rule if during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim a draw the addition of the seventy five move rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after 75 moves without a pawn move or capture without requiring a claim by either player there are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops historically fide has sometimes revised the fifty move rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty move rule 91 note 1 93 draw on time in games with a time control the game is drawn if a player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player 91 1 93 abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghblack to move is not in check and has no legal move the result is stalemate abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghthis is a dead position white s king and bishop are insufficient to checkmate abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghthis is also a dead position neither king is able to capture the other s pawns in order to promote a pawn and effect a checkmate 32 time control a digital chess clock in competition chess games are played with a time control if a player s time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate 91 1 93 the duration of a game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under 3 160 minutes per player for the entire game intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between one and two hours per game a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays one for each player s remaining time analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions a typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves notation main article chess notation historically many different notation systems have been used to record chess moves the standard system today is short form algebraic notation 91 7 93 in this system each square is uniquely identified by a set of coordinates a h for the files followed by 1 8 for the ranks the usual format is initial of the piece moved file of destination square rank of destination square the pieces are identified by their initials in english these are k king q queen r rook b bishop and n knight n is used to avoid confusion with king for example qg5 means queen moves to the g file 5th rank that is to the square g5 different initials may be used for other languages in chess literature figurine algebraic notation fan is frequently used to aid understanding independent of language square names in algebraic chess notation to resolve ambiguities an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved e g ngf3 means knight from the g file moves to the square f3 r1e2 means rook on the first rank moves to e2 for pawns no letter initial is used so e4 means pawn moves to the square e4 if the piece makes a capture x is usually inserted before the destination square thus bxf3 means bishop captures on f3 when a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn making the capture for example exd5 pawn on the e file captures the piece on d5 ranks may be omitted if unambiguous for example exd pawn on the e file captures a piece somewhere on the d file a minority of publications use to indicate a capture and some omit the capture symbol altogether in its most abbreviated form exd5 may be rendered simply as ed an en passant capture may optionally be marked with the notation e p if a pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example e1 q or e1q castling is indicated by the special notations 0 0 or o o for kingside castling and 0 0 0 or o o o for queenside castling a move that places the opponent s king in check usually has the notation added there are no specific notations for discovered check or double check checkmate can be indicated by at the end of the game 1 0 means white won 0 1 means black won and indicates a draw 91 1 93 chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols for example indicates a good move an excellent move a mistake a blunder an interesting move that may not be best or a dubious move not easily refuted 91 8 93 scholar s mate for example one variation of a simple trap known as the scholar s mate see animated diagram can be recorded 160 1 e4 e5 2 qh5 nc6 3 bc4 nf6 4 qxf7 variants of algebraic notation include long form algebraic in which both the departure and destination square are indicated abbreviated algebraic in which capture signs check signs and ranks of pawn captures may be omitted and figurine algebraic notation used in chess publications for universal readability regardless of language portable game notation pgn is a text based file format for recording chess games based on short form english algebraic notation with a small amount of markup pgn files suffix pgn can be processed by most chess software as well as being easily readable by humans until about 1980 the majority of english language chess publications used descriptive notation in which files are identified by the initial letter of the piece that occupies the first rank at the beginning of the game in descriptive notation the common opening move 1 e4 is rendered as 1 p k4 pawn to king four another system is iccf numeric notation recognized by the international correspondence chess federation though its use is in decline in competitive games players are normally required to keep a score record of the game for this purpose only algebraic notation is recognized in fide sanctioned events game scores recorded in a different notation system may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute organized competition tournaments and matches tata steel chess tournament 2019 wijk aan zee the netherlands contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues tournaments and congresses thousands of chess tournaments matches and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels tournaments with a small number of players may use the round robin format in which every player plays one game against every other player for a large numbers of players the swiss system may be used in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same or as similar as possible score in each round in either case a player s score is usually calculated as 1 point for each game won and one half point for each game drawn variations such as football scoring 3 points for a win 1 point for a draw may be used by tournament organizers but ratings are always calculated on the basis of standard scoring there are different ways to denote a player s score in a match or tournament most commonly p g points scored out of games played e g 5 8 p a points for and points against e g 5 2 or w l d w wins l losses d draws e g 4 1 3 the term match refers not to an individual game but to either a series of games between two players or a team competition in which each player of one team plays one game against a player of the other team governance chess s international governing body is usually known by its french acronym fide pronounced fee day french f d ration internationale des checs or international chess federation fide s membership consists of the national chess organizations of over 180 countries there are also several associate members including various supra national organizations the international braille chess association ibca international committee of chess for the deaf

part of the olympic games garry kasparov former world chess champion fide s most visible activity is organizing the world chess championship a role it assumed in 1948 the current world champion is magnus carlsen of norway 91 11 93 the reigning women s world champion is ju wenjun from china 91 12 93 other competitions for individuals include the world junior chess championship the european

these are held independently of fide titles and rankings main article chess titles in order to rank players fide iccf and most national chess organizations use the elo rating system developed by arpad elo an average club player has a rating of about 1500 the highest fide rating of all time 2882 was achieved by magnus carlsen on the march 2014 fide rating list 91 13 93 players may be awarded lifetime titles by fide 91 15 93 grandmaster gm sometimes international grandmaster or igm is used is awarded to world class chess masters apart from world champion grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain before fide will confer the title on a player the player must have an elo rating of at least 2500 at one time and three results of a prescribed standard called norms in tournaments involving other grandmasters including some from countries other than the applicant s there are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title such as winning the world junior championship international master im the conditions are similar to gm but less demanding the minimum rating for the im title is 2400 fide master fm the usual way for a player to qualify for the fide

the international correspondence chess federation national chess organizations may also award titles theory main articles chess theory chess tactics chess strategy chess libraries list of chess books and list of chess periodicals chess has an extensive literature in 1913 the chess historian h j r murray estimated the total number of books magazines and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5 000 91 18 93 b h wood estimated the number as of 1949 to be about 20 000 91 19 93 david hooper and kenneth whyld write that since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications no one knows how many have been printed 91 19 93 significant public chess libraries include the john g white chess and checkers collection at cleveland public library with over 32 000 chess books and over 6 000 bound volumes of chess periodicals 91 20 93 and the chess amp draughts collection at the national library of the netherlands with about 30 000 books 91 21 93 chess theory usually divides the game of chess into three phases with different sets of strategies the opening typically the first 10 to 20 moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle the middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take a more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive opening theory is concerned with finding the best moves in the initial phase of the game there are dozens of different openings and hundreds of variants the oxford companion to chess lists 1 327 named openings and variants 91 22 93 middlegame theory is usually divided into chess tactics and chess strategy chess strategy concentrates on setting and achieving long term positioning advantages during the game 160 for example where to place different pieces 160 while tactics concerns immediate maneuver these two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play endgame theory is concerned with positions where there are only a few pieces left theoretics categorize these positions according to the pieces for example king and pawn endings or rook versus a minor piece opening main article chess opening a chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game the opening moves recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the ruy lopez or sicilian defense they are catalogued in reference works such as the encyclopaedia of chess openings there are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the r ti opening to very aggressive the latvian gambit in some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves 91 23 93 professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve the fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar 91 24 93 development this is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game control of the center control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent king safety it is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities a correctly timed castling can often enhance this pawn structure players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands 160 and to force such weaknesses in the opponent s position most players and theoreticians consider that white by virtue of the first move begins the game with a small advantage this initially gives white the initiative 91 25 93 black usually strives to neutralize white s advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position middlegame main article chess middlegame the middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening there is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position 91 26 93 the middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent s king some typical patterns have their own names for example the boden s mate or the lasker bauer combination 91 27 93 specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure an example is the minority attack which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside the study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames 91 28 93 another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame i e simplify minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending not every reduction of material is good for this purpose for example if one side keeps a light squared bishop and the opponent has a dark squared one the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw even with an advantage of a pawn or sometimes even with a two pawn advantage 91 29 93 tactics main article chess tactics in chess tactics in general concentrate on short term actions 160 so short term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or a computer the possible depth of calculation depends on the player s ability in quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in positions with a limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences 91 30 93 simple one move or two move tactical actions 160 threats exchanges of material and double attacks 160 can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players 91 31 93 a forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination 91 31 93 brilliant combinations 160 such as those in the immortal game 160 are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers a common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players skills is a position where a decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it 91 32 93 strategy main article chess strategy example of underlying pawn structure

strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long term plans for future play during the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares the most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides 91 34 93 the point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points the king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game but in practical terms in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook 91 35 93 these basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece e g advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces e g a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight or the type of position e g knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions 91 36 93 another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton the configuration of pawns on the chessboard 91 37 93 since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position weaknesses in pawn structure include isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created they are often permanent care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack 91 38 93 example of zugzwang abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghthe side having to move is disadvantaged endgame main article chess endgame the endgame also end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board there are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame 91 39 93 pawns become more important endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote a pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank the king which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame emerges as a strong piece in the endgame it is often brought to the center where it can protect its own pawns attack enemy pawns and hinder moves of the opponent s king zugzwang a situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur a disadvantage is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game in the example diagram either side having the move is in zugzwang black to move must play 1 kb7 allowing white to promote the pawn after 2 kd7 white to move must permit a draw either by 1 kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king with the pieces working together with their king for example king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both

written in pahlavi middle persian 91 42 93 and one the harshacharita is in sanskrit 91 43 93 one of these texts the chatrang namak represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess the narrator bozorgmehr explains that chatrang the pahlavi word for chess was introduced to persia by dewasarm a great ruler of india during the reign of khosrow i 91 44 93 the oldest known chess manual was in arabic and dates to about 840 written by al adli ar rumi 800 870 a renowned arab chess player titled kitab ash shatranj the book of chess this is a lost manuscript but is referenced in later works 91 45 93 here also al adli attributes the origins of persian chess to india along with the eighth century collection of fables kal la wa dimna 91 46 93 by the twentieth century a substantial consensus 91 47 93 91 48 93 developed regarding chess s origins in northwest india in the early 7th 160 century 91 49 93 91 50 93 more recently this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny 91 51 93 the early forms of chess in india were known as chatura ga sanskrit literally four divisions of the military 160 infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by pieces which would later evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively chaturanga was played on an 8 8 uncheckered board called asht pada 91 52 93 thence it spread eastward and westward along the silk road the earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby sasanian persia around 600 a d where the game came to be known by the name chatrang persian 91 53 93 chatrang was taken up by the muslim world after the islamic conquest of persia 633 51 where it was then named shatranj arabic persian with the pieces largely retaining their persian names in spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez al shatranj in portuguese as xadrez and in greek as zatrikion which comes directly from the persian chatrang 91 54 93 but in the rest of europe it was replaced by versions of the persian sh h king from which the english words check and chess descend 91 note 3 93 the word checkmate is derived from the persian sh h m t the king is dead 91 55 93 knights templar playing chess libro de los juegos 1283 xiangqi is the form of chess best known in china the eastern migration of chess into china and southeast asia has even less documentation than its migration west making it largely conjectured the word xi ngq was used in china to refer to a game from 569 a d at the latest but it has not been proven if this game was or was not directly related to chess 91 56 93 91 57 93 the first reference to chinese chess appears in a book entitled xu n gua l record of the mysterious and strange dating to about 800 a minority view holds that western chess arose from xi ngq or one of its predecessors 91 58 93 although this has been contested 91 59 93 chess historians jean louis cazaux and rick knowlton contend that xiangqi s intrinsic characteristics make it easier to construct an evolutionary path from china to india persia than the opposite direction 91 60 93 the oldest archaeological chess artifacts ivory pieces were excavated in ancient afrasiab today s samarkand in uzbekistan central asia and date to about 760 with some of them possibly being older remarkably almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the silk road from the former regions of the tarim basin today s xinjiang in china transoxiana sogdiana bactria gandhara to iran on one end and to india through kashmir on the other 91 61 93 the game reached western europe and russia via at least three routes the earliest being in the 9th 160 century by the year 1000 it had spread throughout both the muslim iberia and latin europe 91 62 93 a latin poem called versus de scachis verses on chess dated to the late 10th century has been preserved at einsiedeln abbey in switzerland 1200 1700 origins of the modern game the game of chess was then played and known in all european countries a famous 13th century spanish manuscript covering chess backgammon and dice is known as the libro de los juegos which is the earliest european treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on european tables games the rules were fundamentally similar to those of the arabic shatranj the differences were mostly in the use of a checkered board instead of a plain monochrome board used by arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step in some regions the queen which had replaced the vizier and or the king could also make an initial two square leap under some conditions 91 63 93 a tactical puzzle from lucena s 1497 book around 1200 the rules of shatranj started to be modified in spain and the rest of southern europe culminating several major changes later in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today 91 64 93 a major change was the modern piece movement rules which began to appear in intellectual circles in valencia spain around 1475 91 note 4 93 which established the foundations and brought it very close to current chess these new rules then were quickly adopted in italy and southern france before diffusing into the rest of europe 91 67 93 91 68 93 pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers the queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the 10th 160 century and by the 15th 160 century had become the most powerful piece 91 69 93 in light of that modern chess was often referred to at the time as queen s chess or mad queen chess 91 70 93 castling derived from the king s leap usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety was introduced these new rules quickly spread throughout western europe writings about chess theory began to appear in the 15th 160 century the repetici n de amores y arte de ajedrez repetition of love and the art of playing chess by spanish churchman luis ram rez de lucena was published in salamanca in 1497 91 68 93 lucena and later masters like portuguese pedro damiano italians giovanni leonardo di bona giulio cesare polerio and gioachino greco and spanish bishop ruy l pez de segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames 1700 1873 romantic era the immortal game anderssen vs kieseritzky 1851 in the 18th century the center of european chess life moved from southern europe to mainland france the two most important french masters were fran ois andr danican philidor a musician by profession who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy and later louis charles mah de la bourdonnais who won a famous series of matches against irish master alexander mcdonnell in 1834 91 71 93 centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major european cities like caf de la r gence in paris and simpson s divan in london 91 72 93 91 73 93 at the same time the intellectual movement of romanticism had had a far reaching impact on chess with aesthetics and tactical beauty being held in higher regard than objective soundness and strategic planning as a result virtually all games began with the open game and it was considered unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the king s gambit and the evans gambit 91 74 93 this chess philosophy is known as romantic chess and a sharp tactical style consistent with the principles of chess romanticism was predominant until the late 19th century 91 75 93 the rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th 160 century also in the 19th 160 century the convention that white moves first was established formerly either white or black could move first finally the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized 160 variations in these rules persisted in italy until the late 19th 160 century the resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as western chess 91 76 93 or international chess 91 77 93 particularly in asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent since the 19th 160 century the only rule changes such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition have been technical in nature chess in the netherlands 1864 as the 19th century progressed chess organization developed quickly many chess clubs chess books and chess journals appeared there were correspondence matches between cities for example the london chess club played against the edinburgh chess club in 1824 91 78 93 chess problems became a regular part of 19th century newspapers bernhard horwitz josef kling and samuel loyd composed some of the most influential problems in 1843 von der lasa published his and bilguer s handbuch des schachspiels handbook of chess the first comprehensive manual of chess theory the first modern chess tournament was organized by howard staunton a leading english chess player and was held in london in 1851 it was won by the german adolf anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master his brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time 91 79 93 91 80 93 sparkling games like anderssen s immortal game and evergreen game or morphy s opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the art of chess 91 81 93 deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the american paul morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy morphy won against all important competitors except staunton who refused to play including anderssen during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863 morphy s success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks 91 82 93 1873 1945 birth of a sport wilhelm steinitz the first official world chess champion from 1886 to 1894 prague born wilhelm steinitz laid the foundations for a scientific approach to the game the art of breaking a position down into components 91 83 93 and preparing correct plans 91 84 93 in addition to his theoretical achievements steinitz founded an important tradition his triumph over the leading german master johannes zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official world chess championship this win marked a stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking tactical style predominant in the romantic era to a more positional strategic style introduced to the chess world by steinitz steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player the german mathematician emanuel lasker who maintained this title for 27 years the longest tenure of any world champion 91 85 93 after the end of the 19th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew the first olympiad was held in paris in 1924 and fide was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event in 1927 the women s world chess championship was established the first to hold the title was czech english master vera menchik 91 86 93 a prodigy from cuba jos ra l capablanca known for his skill in endgames won the world championship from lasker in 1921 capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years from 1916 to 1924 his successor 1927 was the russian french alexander alekhine a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946 alekhine briefly lost the title to dutch player max euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later 91 87 93 in the interwar period chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so called hypermodernists like aron nimzowitsch and richard r ti they advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack 91 88 93 1945 1990 post world war ii era bobby fischer world champion from 1972 to 1975 after the death of alekhine a new world champion was sought fide which has controlled the title since then ran a tournament of elite players the winner of the 1948 tournament was russian mikhail botvinnik in 1950 fide established a system of titles conferring the titles of grandmaster and international master on 27 players some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess grandmaster was first formally conferred by tsar nicholas ii of russia to lasker capablanca alekhine tarrasch and marshall but this is a disputed claim 91 note 5 93 mikhail botvinnik the first post war world champion botvinnik started an era of soviet dominance in the chess world which mainly through the soviet government s politically inspired efforts to demonstrate intellectual superiority over the west 91 89 93 91 90 93 stood almost uninterrupted for more than a half century until the dissolution of the soviet union there was only one non soviet champion american bobby fischer champion 1972 1975 91 91 93 botvinnik also revolutionized opening theory previously black strove for equality attempting to neutralize white s first move advantage as black botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning 91 92 93 in the previous informal system of world championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match fide set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches the world s strongest players were seeded into interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from zonal tournaments the leading finishers in these interzonals would go through the candidates stage which was initially a tournament and later a series of knockout matches the winner of the candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title a champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later this system operated on a three year cycle botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years he won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954 in 1957 he lost to vasily smyslov but regained the title in a rematch in 1958 in 1960 he lost the title to the 23 year old latvian prodigy mikhail tal an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever 91 93 93 hence his nickname the magician from riga botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961 following the 1961 event fide abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch and the next champion armenian tigran petrosian a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills held the title for two cycles 1963 1969 his successor boris spassky from russia champion 1969 1972 won games in both positional and sharp tactical style 91 94 93 the next championship the so called match of the century saw the first non soviet challenger since world war ii american bobby fischer fischer defeated his opponents in the candidates matches by unheard of margins and convincingly defeated spassky for the world championship the match was followed closely by news media of the day leading to a surge in popularity for chess it also held significant political importance at the height of the cold war with the match being seen by both sides as a microcosm of the conflict between east and west 91 95 93 in 1975 however fischer refused to defend his title against soviet anatoly karpov when he was unable to reach agreement on conditions with fide and karpov obtained the title by default 91 96 93 fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings 91 97 93 karpov defended his title twice against viktor korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes 91 98 93 in the 1984 world chess championship karpov faced his toughest challenge to date the young garry kasparov from baku soviet azerbaijan the match was aborted in controversial circumstances after 5 months and 48 games with karpov leading by 5 wins to 3 but evidently exhausted many commentators believed kasparov who had won the last two games would have won the match had it continued kasparov won the 1985 rematch kasparov and karpov contested three further closely fought matches in 1986 1987 and 1990 kasparov winning them all 91 99 93 kasparov became the dominant figure of world chess from the mid 1980s until his retirement from competition in 2005 beginnings of chess technology chess playing computer programs later known as chess engines began to appear in the 1960s in 1970 the first major computer chess tournament the north american computer chess championship was held followed in 1974 by the first world computer chess championship in the late 1970s dedicated home chess computers such as fidelity electronics chess challenger became commercially available as well as software to run on home computers however the overall standard of computer chess was low until the 1990s the first endgame tablebases which provided perfect play for relatively simple endgames such as king and rook versus king and bishop appeared in the late 1970s this set a precedent to the complete six and seven piece tablebases that became available in the 2000s and 2010s respectively 91 100 93 the first commercial chess database a collection of chess games searchable by move and position was introduced by the german company chessbase in 1987 databases containing millions of chess games have since had a profound effect on opening theory and other areas of chess research digital chess clocks were invented in 1973 though they did not become commonplace until the 1990s digital clocks allow for time controls involving increments and delays 1990 present rise of computers and online chess technology the internet enabled online chess as a new medium of playing with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time the first such server known as internet chess server or ics was developed at the university of utah in 1992 ics formed the basis for the first commercial chess server the internet chess club which was launched in 1995 and for other early chess servers such as fics free internet chess server since then many other platforms have appeared and online chess began to rival over the board chess in popularity 91 101 93 91 102 93 during the 2020 covid 19 pandemic the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world combined with the success of the popular netflix show the queen s gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments notably pogchamps and chess twitch streamers resulted in a surge of popularity not only for online chess but for the game of chess in general this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the 2020 online chess boom 91 103 93 91 104 93 computer chess has also seen major advances by the 1990s chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs and in 1997 deep blue defeated world champion garry kasparov in a six game match starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess in the 2010s engines of superhuman strength became accessible for free on a number of pc and mobile platforms and free engine analysis became a commonplace feature on internet chess servers an adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating which has grown to be a major concern in both over the board and online chess 91 105 93 in 2017 alphazero a neural network also capable of playing shogi and go was introduced since then many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written the best of which have surpassed the traditional brute force engines alphazero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game which affected the style of play at the top level 91 106 93 as endgame tablebases developed they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game theoretical outcome was previously unknown such as positions with king queen and pawn against king and queen in 1991 lewis stiller published a tablebase for select six piece endgames 91 107 93 91 108 93 and by 2005 following the publication of nalimov tablebases all six piece endgame positions were solved in 2012 lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven piece endgame positions 91 109 93 use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis technological progress made in the 1990s and the 21st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels as well as the state of chess as a spectator sport previously preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as chess informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents games today preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties 91 110 93 a number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels such as online courses tactics trainers and video lessons 91 111 93 since the late 1990s it has been possible to follow major international chess events online the players moves being relayed in real time sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities while in the past the moves have been relayed live today chess organizers will often impose a half hour delay as an anti cheating measure in the mid to late 2010s and especially following the 2020 online boom it became commonplace for supergrandmasters such as hikaru nakamura and magnus carlsen to livestream chess content on platforms such as twitch 91 112 93 91 113 93 also following the boom online chess started being viewed as an e sport with e sport teams signing chess players for the first time in 2020 91 114 93 growth organized chess even for young children has become common fide holds world championships for age levels down to 8 years old the largest tournaments in number of players are those held for children 91 115 93 the number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era kenneth regan and guy haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines they concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play rather than rating inflation or title inflation 91 116 93 91 non primary source needed 93 professional chess in 1993 garry kasparov and nigel short broke ties with fide to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing professional chess association pca from then until 2006 there were two simultaneous world championships and respective world champions the pca or classical champions extending the steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of games and the other following fide s new format of many players competing in a large knockout tournament to determine the champion kasparov lost his pca title in 2000 to vladimir kramnik of russia 91 117 93 due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again despite this he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world s highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in 2005 the world chess championship 2006 in which kramnik beat the fide world champion veselin topalov reunified the titles and made kramnik the undisputed world chess champion 91 118 93 in september 2007 he lost the title to viswanathan anand of india who won the championship tournament in mexico city anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008 91 119 93 2010 and 2012 in 2013 magnus carlsen of norway beat anand in the 2013 world chess championship 91 120 93 he defended his title 4 times since then and is the reigning world champion

discouraged by various religious authorities in middle ages jewish 91 128 93 catholic and orthodox 91 129 93 some muslim authorities prohibited it even recently for example ruhollah khomeini in 1979 and abdul aziz ash sheikh even later 91 130 93 during the age of enlightenment chess was viewed as a means of self improvement benjamin franklin in his article the morals of chess 1750 wrote the game of chess is not merely an idle amusement several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired and strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions for life is a kind of chess in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effect of prudence or the want of it by playing at chess then we may learn i foresight which looks a little into futurity and considers the consequences that may attend an action ii circumspection which surveys the whole chess board or scene of action the relation of the several pieces and their situations iii caution not to make our moves too hastily 91 131 93 through the

schools around the world today many schools host chess clubs and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children tournaments are held regularly in many countries hosted by organizations such as the united states chess federation and the national scholastic chess foundation 91 134 93 chess is many times depicted in the arts significant works where chess plays a key role range from thomas middleton s a game at chess to through the looking glass by lewis carroll to vladimir nabokov s the defense to the royal game by stefan zweig chess has also featured in film classics such as ingmar bergman s the seventh seal satyajit ray s the chess players and powell and pressburger s a matter of life and death chess is also present in contemporary popular culture for example the characters in star trek play a futuristic version of the game called federation tri dimensional chess 91 135 93 and wizard s chess is played in j k rowling s harry potter 91 136 93 mathematics see

such as the knight s tour and the eight queens puzzle have been known for hundreds of years mathematicians euler legendre de moivre and vandermonde studied the knight s tour the number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be 4 59 0 38 x1044 with a 95 confidence level 91 137 93 with a game tree complexity of approximately 10123 the game tree complexity of chess was first calculated by claude shannon as 10120 a number known as the shannon number 91 138 93 an average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves but there may be as few as zero in the case of checkmate or stalemate or in a constructed position as many as 218 91 139 93 in 1913 ernst zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory 91 140 93 zermelo s theorem states that it is possible to solve chess i e to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game either white can force a win or black can force a win or both sides can force at least a draw 91 141 93 however with 1043 legal positions in chess it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology 91 142 93 psychology there is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology 91 note 6 93 91 144 93 91 145 93 91 146 93 91 147 93 alfred binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal rather than visuospatial ability lies at the core of expertise 91 148 93 91 149 93 in his doctoral thesis adriaan de groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position 91 150 93 according to de groot this perception made possible by years of practice and study is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves de groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly the ability to memorize does not alone account for chess playing skill since masters and novices when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces had equivalent recall about six positions in each case rather it is the ability to recognize patterns which are then memorized which distinguished the skilled players from the novices when the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game the masters had almost total positional recall 91 151 93 more recent research has focused on chess as mental training the respective roles of knowledge and look ahead search brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices blindfold chess the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill gender differences and computational models of chess expertise the role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess 91 152 93 recent research however fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are
