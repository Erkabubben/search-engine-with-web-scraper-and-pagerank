heuristic computer science from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search type of algorithm produces approximately correct solutions for other uses see heuristic disambiguation in mathematical optimization and computer science heuristic from greek i find discover is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an approximate solution or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution this is achieved by trading optimality completeness accuracy or precision for speed in a way it can be considered a shortcut a heuristic function also simply called a heuristic is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow for example it may approximate the exact solution 91 1 93 contents 1 definition and motivation 2 trade off 3 examples 3 1 simpler problem 3 2 travelling salesman problem 3 3 search 3 4 newell and simon heuristic search hypothesis 3 5 antivirus software 4 pitfalls 5 etymology 6 see also 7 references definition and motivation edit the objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand this solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem or it may simply approximate the exact solution but it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time heuristics may produce results by themselves or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency e g they may be used to generate good seed values results about np hardness in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimization problems that need to be routinely solved in real world applications heuristics underlie the whole field of artificial intelligence and the computer simulation of thinking as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms 91 2 93 trade off edit the trade off criteria for deciding whether to use a heuristic for solving a given problem include the following optimality when several solutions exist for a given problem does the heuristic guarantee that the best solution will be found is it actually necessary to find the best solution completeness when several solutions exist for a given problem can the heuristic find them all do we actually need all solutions many heuristics are only meant to find one solution accuracy and precision can the heuristic provide a confidence interval for the purported solution is the error bar on the solution unreasonably large execution time is this the best known heuristic for solving this type of problem some heuristics converge faster than others some heuristics are only marginally quicker than classic methods in which case the overhead on calculating the heuristic might have negative impact in some cases it may be difficult to decide whether the solution found by the heuristic is good enough because the theory underlying heuristics is not very elaborate examples edit simpler problem edit one way of achieving the computational performance gain expected of a heuristic consists of solving a simpler problem whose solution is also a solution to the initial problem travelling salesman problem edit an example of approximation is described by jon bentley for solving the travelling salesman problem tsp given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city so as to select the order to draw using a pen plotter tsp is known to be np hard so an optimal solution for even a moderate size problem is difficult to solve instead the greedy algorithm can be used to give a good but not optimal solution it is an approximation to the optimal answer in a reasonably short amount of time the greedy algorithm heuristic says to pick whatever is currently the best next step regardless of whether that prevents or even makes impossible good steps later it is a heuristic in the sense that practice indicates it is a good enough solution while theory indicates that there are better solutions and even indicates how much better in some cases 91 3 93 search edit another example of heuristic making an algorithm faster occurs in certain search problems initially the heuristic tries every possibility at each step like the full space search algorithm but it can stop the search at any time if the current possibility is already worse than the best solution already found in such search problems a heuristic can be used to try good choices first so that bad paths can be eliminated early see alpha beta pruning in the case of best first search algorithms such as a search the heuristic improves the algorithm s convergence while maintaining its correctness as long as the heuristic is admissible newell and simon heuristic search hypothesis edit in their turing award acceptance speech allen newell and herbert a simon discuss the heuristic search hypothesis a physical symbol system will repeatedly generate and modify known symbol structures until the created structure matches the solution structure each following step depends upon the step before it thus the heuristic search learns what avenues to pursue and which ones to disregard by measuring how close the current step is to the solution therefore some possibilities will never be generated as they are measured to be less likely to complete the solution a heuristic method can accomplish its task by using search trees however instead of generating all possible solution branches a heuristic selects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches it is selective at each decision point picking branches that are more likely to produce solutions 91 4 93 antivirus software edit antivirus software often uses heuristic rules for detecting viruses and other forms of malware heuristic scanning looks for code and or behavioral patterns common to a class or family of viruses with different sets of rules for different viruses if a file or executing process is found to contain matching code patterns and or to be performing that set of activities then the scanner infers that the file is infected the most advanced part of behavior based heuristic scanning is that it can work against highly randomized self modifying mutating polymorphic viruses that cannot be easily detected by simpler string scanning methods heuristic scanning has the potential to detect future viruses without requiring the virus to be first detected somewhere else submitted to the virus scanner developer analyzed and a detection update for the scanner provided to the scanner s users pitfalls edit some heuristics have a strong underlying theory they are either derived in a top down manner from the theory or are arrived at based on either experimental or real world data others are just rules of thumb based on real world observation or experience without even a glimpse of theory the latter are exposed to a larger number of pitfalls when a heuristic is reused in various contexts because it has been seen to work in one context without having been mathematically proven to meet a given set of requirements it is possible that the current data set does not necessarily represent future data sets see overfitting and that purported solutions turn out to be akin to noise statistical analysis can be conducted when employing heuristics to estimate the probability of incorrect outcomes to use a heuristic for solving a search problem or a knapsack problem it is necessary to check that the heuristic is
