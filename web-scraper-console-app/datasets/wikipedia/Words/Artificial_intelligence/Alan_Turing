theoretical biologist 91 6 93 turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 he is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence 91 10 93 born in maida vale london turing was raised in southern england he graduated at king s college cambridge with a degree in mathematics whilst he was a fellow at cambridge he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a turing machine and went on to prove that the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable in 1938 he obtained his phd from the department of mathematics at princeton university during the second world war turing worked for the government code and cypher school gc amp cs at bletchley park britain s codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence for a time he led hut 8 the section that was responsible for german naval cryptanalysis here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers including improvements to the pre war polish bomba method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the enigma machine turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the allies to defeat the axis powers in many crucial engagements including the battle of the atlantic 91 11 93 91 12 93 after the war turing worked at the national physical laboratory where he designed the automatic computing engine ace one of the first designs for a stored program computer in 1948 turing joined max newman s computing machine laboratory at the victoria university of manchester where he helped develop the manchester computers 91 13 93 and became interested in mathematical biology he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis 91 1 93 and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousov zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s despite these accomplishments turing was never fully recognised in britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the official secrets act 91 14 93 turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts he accepted hormone treatment with des a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration as an alternative to prison turing died on 7 june 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning an inquest determined his death as a suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning following a public campaign in 2009 the british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology on behalf of the british government for the appalling way turing was treated queen elizabeth ii granted a posthumous pardon in 2013 the term alan turing law is now used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the united kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts 91 15 93 turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him including an annual award for computer science innovations he appears on the current bank of england 50 note which was released on 23 june 2021 to coincide with his birthday a 2019 bbc series as voted by the audience named him the greatest person of the 20th century contents 1 early life and education 1 1 family 1 2 school 1 3

life and education family turing was born in maida vale london while his father julius mathison turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the indian civil service ics of the british raj government at chatrapur then in the madras presidency and presently in odisha state in india 91 16 93 91 17 93 turing s father was the son of a clergyman the rev 160 john robert turing from a scottish family of merchants that had been based in the netherlands and included a baronet turing s mother julius s wife was ethel sara turing n e stoney 1881 1976 daughter of edward waller stoney chief engineer of the madras railways the stoneys were a protestant anglo irish gentry family from both county tipperary and county longford while ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in county clare 91 18 93 julius and ethel married on 1 october 1907 at batholomew s church on clyde road in dublin 91 19 93 julius s work with the ics brought the family to british india where his grandfather had been a general in the bengal army however both julius and ethel wanted their children to be brought up in britain so they moved to maida vale 91 20 93 london where alan turing was born on 23 june 1912 as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth 91 21 93 91 22 93 later the colonnade hotel 91 16 93 91 23 93 turing had an elder brother john the father of sir john dermot turing 12th baronet of the turing baronets 91 24 93 turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during turing s childhood years his parents travelled between hastings in the united kingdom 91 25 93 and india leaving their two sons to stay with a retired army couple at hastings turing stayed at baston lodge upper maze hill st leonards on sea now marked with a blue plaque 91 26 93 the plaque was unveiled on 23 june 2012 the centenary of turing s birth 91 27 93 very early in life turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently 91 28 93 his parents purchased a house in guildford in 1927 and turing lived there during school holidays the location is also marked with a blue plaque 91 29 93 school turing s parents enrolled him at st michael s a primary school at 20 charles road st leonards on sea from the age of six to nine the headmistress recognised his talent noting that she has had clever boys and hardworking boys but alan is a genius 91 30 93 between january 1922 and 1926 turing was educated at hazelhurst preparatory school an independent school in the village of frant in sussex now east sussex 91 31 93 in 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to sherborne school 91 32 93 a boarding independent school in the market town of sherborne in dorset where he boarded at westcott house the first day of term coincided with the 1926 general strike in britain but turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles 97 160 km from southampton to sherborne stopping overnight at an inn 91 33 93 turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics his headmaster wrote to his parents i hope he will not fall between two stools if he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated if he is to be solely a scientific specialist he is wasting his time at a public school 91 34 93 despite this turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus in 1928 aged 16 turing encountered albert einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce einstein s questioning of newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit 91 35 93 christopher morcom at sherborne turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil christopher collan morcom 13 july 1911 13 february 1930 91 36 93 who has been described as turing s first love their relationship provided inspiration in turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by morcom s death in february 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously 91 37 93 91 38 93 91 39 93 the event caused turing great sorrow he coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with morcom in a letter to morcom s mother frances isobel morcom n e swan turing wrote i am sure i could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited i regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and i think he felt a little the same about me 160 i know i must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do 91 40 93 turing s relationship with morcom s mother continued long after morcom s death with her sending gifts to turing and him sending letters typically on morcom s birthday 91 41 93 a day before the third anniversary of morcom s death 13 february 1933 he wrote to mrs morcom i expect you will be thinking of chris when this reaches you i shall too and this letter is just to tell you that i shall be thinking of chris and of you tomorrow i am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here your affectionate alan 91 42 93 some have speculated that morcom s death was the cause of turing s atheism and materialism 91 43 93 apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death in a later letter also written to morcom s mother turing wrote personally i believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body 160 as regards the actual connection between spirit and body i consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected when the body is asleep i cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately 91 44 93 91 45 93 university and work on computability after sherborne turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at king s college cambridge where he was awarded first class honours in mathematics in 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of king s college on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved a version of the central limit theorem 91 46 93 unknown to turing this version of the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by jarl waldemar lindeberg despite this the committee found turing s methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship abram besicovitch s report for the committee went so far as to say that if turing s work had been published before lindeberg s it would have been an important event in the mathematical literature of that year 91 47 93 91 48 93 91 49 93 in 1936 turing published his paper on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem 91 50 93 it was published in the proceedings of the london mathematical society journal in two parts the first on 30 november and the second on 23 december 91 51 93 in this paper turing reformulated kurt g del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing g del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as turing machines the entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by german mathematician david hilbert in 1928 turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm he went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a turing machine will ever halt this paper has been called easily the most influential math paper in history 91 52 93 king s college cambridge where turing was an undergraduate in 1931 and became a fellow in 1935 the computer room is named after him although turing s proof was published shortly after alonzo church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus 91 53 93 turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than church s 91 54 93 it also included a notion of a universal machine now known as a universal turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could church s lambda calculus according to the church turing thesis turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable john von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to turing s paper 91 55 93 to this day turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation from september 1936 to july 1938 turing spent most of his time studying under church at princeton university 91 4 93 in the second year as a jane eliza procter visiting fellow in addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier 91 56 93 in june 1938 he obtained his phd from the department of mathematics at princeton 91 57 93 his dissertation systems of logic based on ordinals 91 58 93 91 59 93 introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing in which turing machines are augmented with so called oracles allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by turing machines john von neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to the united kingdom 91 60 93 career and research when turing returned to cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by ludwig wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics 91 61 93 the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from turing and other students from students notes 91 62 93 turing and wittgenstein argued and disagreed with turing defending formalism and wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them 91 63 93 cryptanalysis during the second world war turing was a leading participant in the breaking of german ciphers at bletchley park the historian and wartime codebreaker asa briggs has said you needed exceptional talent you needed genius at bletchley and turing s was that genius 91 64 93 from september 1938 turing worked part time with the government code and cypher school gc amp cs the british codebreaking organisation he concentrated on cryptanalysis of the enigma cipher machine used by nazi germany together with dilly knox a senior gc amp cs codebreaker 91 65 93 soon after the july 1939 meeting near warsaw at which the polish cipher bureau gave the british and french details of the wiring of enigma machine s rotors and their method of decrypting enigma machine s messages turing and knox developed a broader solution 91 66 93 the polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the germans were likely to change which they in fact did in may 1940 turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement on the polish bomba 91 67 93 two cottages in the stable yard at bletchley park turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to hut 8 on 4 september 1939 the day after the uk declared war on germany turing reported to bletchley park the wartime station of gc amp cs 91 68 93 like all others who came to bletchley he was required to sign the official secrets act in which he agreed not to disclose anything about his work at bletchley with severe legal penalties for violating the act 91 69 93 specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that turing made during the war the others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the german navy developing a statistical procedure dubbed banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes developing a procedure dubbed turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the lorenz sz 40 42 tunny cipher machine and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at hanslope park that was codenamed delilah by using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process turing made an innovative contribution to the subject he wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled the applications of probability to cryptography 91 70 93 and paper on statistics of repetitions 91 71 93 which were of such value to gc amp cs and its successor gchq that they were not released to the uk national archives until april 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth a gchq mathematician who identified himself only as richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted under the official secrets act for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis 91 72 93 he said the fact that the contents had been restricted shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject the papers detailed using mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible richard said that gchq had now squeezed the juice out of the two papers and was happy for them to be released into the public domain turing had a reputation for eccentricity at bletchley park he was known to his colleagues as prof and his treatise on enigma was known as the prof s book 91 73 93 91 74 93 according to historian ronald lewin jack good a cryptanalyst who worked with turing said of his colleague in the first week of june each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off his bicycle had a fault the chain would come off at regular intervals instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen 91 75 93 peter hilton recounted his experience working with turing in hut 8 in his reminiscences of bletchley park from a century of mathematics in america 91 76 93 it is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues we can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts however the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement alan turing was such a genius and those like myself who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity created by the strange exigencies of the second world war to be able to count turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us hilton echoed similar thoughts in the nova pbs documentary decoding nazi secrets 91 77 93 while working at bletchley turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the 40 miles 64 160 km to london when he was needed for meetings 91 78 93 and he was capable of world class marathon standards 91 79 93 91 80 93 turing tried out for the 1948 british olympic team but he was hampered by an injury his tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than british silver medallist thomas richards olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes he was walton athletic club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone 91 81 93 91 82 93 91 83 93 when asked why he ran so hard in training he replied i have such a stressful job that the only way i can get it out of my mind is by running hard it s the only way i can get some release 91 84 93 due to the problems of counterfactual history it is hard to estimate the precise effect ultra intelligence had on the war 91 85 93 however official war historian harry hinsley estimated that this work shortened the war in europe by more than two years and saved over 14 160 million lives 91 86 93 at the end of the war a memo was sent to all those who had worked at bletchley park reminding them that the code of silence dictated by the official secrets act did not end with the war but would continue indefinitely 91 69 93 thus even though turing was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire obe in 1946 by king george vi for his wartime services his work remained secret for many years 91 87 93 91 88 93 bombe main article bombe within weeks of arriving at bletchley park 91 68 93 turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe which could break enigma more effectively than the polish bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived the bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician gordon welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack enigma enciphered messages 91 89 93 a working replica of a bombe now at the national museum of computing on bletchley parkthe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an enigma message i e rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib a fragment of probable plaintext for each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 1019 states or 1022 states for the four rotor u boat variant 91 90 93 the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically 91 91 93 the bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail a contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter which was impossible with the enigma the first bombe was installed on 18 march 1940 91 92 93 action this day main article action this day memo by late 1941 turing and his fellow cryptanalysts gordon welchman hugh alexander and stuart milner barry were frustrated building on the work of the poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting enigma signals but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals in the summer they had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month however they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of german adjustments they had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but had failed 91 93 93 on 28 october they wrote directly to winston churchill explaining their difficulties with turing as the first named they emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces 91 93 93 as andrew hodges biographer of turing later wrote this letter had an electric effect 91 94 93 churchill wrote a memo to general ismay which read action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done on 18 november the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken 91 94 93 the cryptographers at bletchley park did not know of the prime minister s response but as milner barry recalled all that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth 91 95 93 more than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war 91 96 93 statue of turing by stephen kettle at bletchley park commissioned by sidney frank built from half a million pieces of welsh slate 91 97 93 hut 8 and the naval enigma turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of german naval enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and i could have it to myself 91 98 93 in december 1939 turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services 91 98 93 91 99 93 that same night he also conceived of the idea of banburismus a sequential statistical technique what abraham wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval enigma though i was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken 91 98 93 for this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes 91 100 93 later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans one tenth of a ban was used in cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher 91 101 93 turing travelled to the united states in november 1942 91 102 93 and worked with us navy cryptanalysts on the naval enigma and bombe construction in washington he also visited their computing machine laboratory in dayton ohio turing s reaction to the american bombe design was far from enthusiastic the american bombe programme was to produce 336 bombes one for each wheel order i used to smile inwardly at the conception of bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it 91 103 93 during this trip he also assisted at bell labs with the development of secure speech devices 91 104 93 he returned to bletchley park in march 1943 during his absence hugh alexander had officially assumed the position of head of hut 8 although alexander had been de facto head for some time turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at bletchley park 91 105 93 alexander wrote of turing s contribution there should be no question in anyone s mind that turing s work was the biggest factor in hut 8 s success in the early days he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the hut but he also shared with welchman and keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe it is always difficult to say that anyone is absolutely indispensable but if anyone was indispensable to hut 8 it was turing the pioneer s work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in hut 8 felt that the magnitude of turing s contribution was never fully realised by the outside world 91 106 93 turingery main article turingery in july 1942 turing devised a technique termed turingery or jokingly turingismus 91 107 93 for use against the lorenz cipher messages produced by the germans new geheimschreiber secret writer machine this was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed tunny at bletchley park turingery was a method of wheel breaking i e a procedure for working out the cam settings of tunny s wheels 91 108 93 he also introduced the tunny team to tommy flowers who under the guidance of max newman went on to build the colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the heath robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages 91 109 93 some have mistakenly said that turing was a key figure in the design of the colossus computer turingery and the statistical approach of banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher 91 110 93 91 111 93 but he was not directly involved in the colossus development 91 112 93 delilah following his work at bell labs in the us 91 113 93 turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the secret service s radio security service later hmgcc at hanslope park at the park he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer donald bayley together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed delilah 91 114 93 the machine was intended for different applications but it lacked the capability for use with long distance radio transmissions in any case delilah was completed too late to be used during the war though the system worked fully with turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a winston churchill speech delilah was not adopted for use 91 115 93 turing also consulted with bell labs on the development of sigsaly a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war early computers and the turing test plaque 78 high street hampton between 1945 and 1947 turing lived in hampton london 91 116 93 while he worked on the design of the ace automatic computing engine at the national physical laboratory npl he presented a paper on 19 february 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer 91 117 93 von neumann s incomplete first draft of a report on the edvac had predated turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to john r womersley superintendent of the npl mathematics division it contains a number of ideas which are dr turing s own 91 118 93 although ace was a feasible design the effect of the official secrets act surrounding the wartime work at bletchley park made it impossible for turing to explain the basis of his analysis of how a computer installation involving human operators would work 91 119 93 this led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned in late 1947 he returned to cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on intelligent machinery that was not published in his lifetime 91 120 93 while he was at cambridge the pilot ace was being built in his absence it executed its first program on 10 may 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the english electric deuce and the american bendix g 15 the full version of turing s ace was not built until after his death 91 121 93 according to the memoirs of the german computer pioneer heinz billing from the max planck institute for physics published by genscher d sseldorf there was a meeting between turing and konrad zuse 91 122 93 it took place in g ttingen in 1947 the interrogation had the form of a colloquium participants were womersley turing porter from england and a few german researchers like zuse walther and billing for more details see herbert bruderer konrad zuse und die schweiz in 1948 turing was appointed reader in the mathematics department at the victoria university of manchester a year later he became deputy director of the computing machine laboratory where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the manchester mark 1 turing wrote the first version of the programmer s manual for this machine and was recruited by ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine the ferranti mark 1 he continued to be paid consultancy fees by ferranti until his death 91 123 93 during this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics 91 124 93 and in computing machinery and intelligence mind october 1950 turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that became known as the turing test an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent the idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being 91 125 93 in the paper turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education a reversed form of the turing test is widely used on the internet the captcha test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer in 1948 turing working with his former undergraduate colleague d g champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist by 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the turochamp 91 126 93 in 1952 he tried to implement it on a ferranti mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program instead turing ran the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard taking about half an hour per move the game was recorded 91 127 93 according to garry kasparov turing s program played a recognizable game of chess 91 128 93 the program lost to turing s colleague alick glennie although it is said that it won a game against champernowne s wife isabel 91 129 93 his turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century 91 130 93 pattern formation and mathematical biology when turing was 39 years old in 1951 he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece the chemical basis of morphogenesis in january 1952 he was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms he suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis 91 131 93 he used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions for example if a catalyst a is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst a then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst a but also produced an inhibitor b that slowed down the production of a if a and b then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where a dominated and some where b did to calculate the extent of this turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots the russian biochemist boris belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics belousov was not aware of turing s paper in the philosophical transactions of the royal society 91 132 93 although published before the structure and role of dna was understood turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology 91 133 93 one of the early applications of turing s paper was the work by james murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small 91 134 93 91 135 93 91 136 93 further research in the area suggests that turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest 91 137 93 in 2012 sheth et al found that in mice removal of hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a turing type mechanism 91 138 93 later papers were not available until collected works of a 160 m 160 turing was published in 1992 91 139 93 personal life engagement in 1941 turing proposed marriage to hut 8 colleague joan clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived after admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage 91 140 93 homosexuality and indecency conviction in january 1952 turing was 39 when he started a relationship with arnold murray a 19 year old unemployed man just before christmas turing was walking along manchester s oxford road when he met murray just outside the regal cinema and invited him to lunch on 23 january turing s house was burgled murray told turing that he and the burglar were acquainted and turing reported the crime to the police during the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with murray homosexual acts were criminal offences in the united kingdom at that time 91 141 93 and both men were charged with gross indecency under section 11 of the criminal law amendment act 1885 91 142 93 initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 february during which turing s solicitor reserved his defence i e did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor and he entered a plea of guilty 91 143 93 the case regina v turing and murray was brought to trial on 31 march 1952 91 144 93 turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation his probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido known as chemical castration 91 145 93 he accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or des a synthetic oestrogen this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year the treatment rendered turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form 91 146 93 fulfilling in the literal sense turing s prediction that no doubt i shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who i ve not found out 91 147 93 91 148 93 murray was given a conditional discharge 91 149 93 turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the government communications headquarters gchq the british signals intelligence agency that had evolved from gc amp cs in 1946 though he kept his academic job he was denied entry into the united states after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other european countries 91 150 93 treasure in the 1940s turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a german invasion in order to protect it he bought two silver bars weighing 3 200 160 oz 90 160 kg and worth 250 in 2022 8 000 adjusted for inflation 48 000 at spot price and buried them in a wood near bletchley park 91 151 93 upon returning to dig them up turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly he had hidden them this along with the fact that the area had been renovated meant that he never regained the silver 91 152 93 death a blue plaque on the house at 43 adlington road wilmslow where turing lived and died 91 153 93 on 8 june 1954 at his house at 43 adlington road wilmslow 91 153 93 turing s housekeeper found him dead he had died the previous day at the age of 41 cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death 91 154 93 when his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide 91 155 93 it was speculated that this was the means by which turing had consumed a fatal dose an inquest determined that he had committed suicide 91 145 93 andrew hodges and another biographer david leavitt have both speculated that turing was re enacting a scene from the walt disney film snow white and the seven dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both men noted that in leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the wicked queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew 91 156 93 turing s remains were cremated at woking crematorium on 12 june 1954 91 157 93 and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium just as his father s had been 91 158 93 philosopher jack copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict he suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of turing s death the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons the potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half eaten 91 159 93 furthermore turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment which had been discontinued a year previously with good humour and had shown no sign of despondency before his death he even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend 91 159 93 turing s mother believed that the ingestion was accidental resulting from her son s careless storage of laboratory chemicals 91 160 93 biographer andrew hodges theorised that turing deliberately left the nature of his death ambiguous in order to shield his mother from the knowledge that he had killed himself 91 161 93 turing s obe currently held in sherborne school archives it has been suggested that turing s belief in fortune telling may have caused his depressed mood 91 158 93 as a youth turing had been told by a fortune teller that he would be a genius in mid may 1954 shortly before his death turing again decided to consult a fortune teller during a day trip to st annes on sea with the greenbaum family 91 158 93 according to the greenbaums daughter barbara 91 162 93 but it was a lovely sunny day and alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the pleasure beach at blackpool we found a fortune teller s tent and alan said he d like to go in so we waited around for him to come back and this sunny cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale shaking horror stricken face something had happened we don t know what the fortune teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy i think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide government apology and pardon main article alan turing law in august 2009 british programmer john graham cumming started a petition urging the british government to apologise for turing s prosecution as a homosexual 91 163 93 91 164 93 the petition received more than 30 000 signatures 91 165 93 91 166 93 the prime minister gordon brown acknowledged the petition releasing a statement on 10 september 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of turing as appalling 91 165 93 91 167 93 thousands of people have come together to demand justice for alan turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated while turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can t put the clock back his treatment was of course utterly unfair and i am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry i and we all are for what happened to him 160 so on behalf of the british government and all those who live freely thanks to alan s work i am very proud to say we re sorry you deserved so much better 91 165 93 91 168 93 in december 2011 william jones and his member of parliament john leech created an e petition 91 169 93 requesting that the british government pardon turing for his conviction of gross indecency 91 170 93 we ask the hm government to grant a pardon to alan turing for the conviction of gross indecency in 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency with another man and was forced to undergo so called organo therapy chemical castration two years later he killed himself with cyanide aged just 41 alan turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he d done so much to save this remains a shame on the british government and british history a pardon can go some way to healing this damage it may act as an apology to many of the other gay men not as well known as alan turing who were subjected to these laws 91 169 93 the petition gathered over 37 000 signatures 91 169 93 91 171 93 and was submitted to parliament by the manchester mp john leech but the request was discouraged by justice minister lord mcnally who said 91 172 93 a posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as alan turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence he would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted it is tragic that alan turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort however the law at the time required a prosecution and as such long standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right ensure instead that we never again return to those times 91 173 93 john leech the mp for manchester withington 2005 15 submitted several bills to parliament 91 174 93 and led a high profile campaign to secure the pardon leech made the case in the house of commons that turing s contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood 91 175 93 leech continued to take the bill through parliament and campaigned for several years gaining the public support of numerous leading scientists including stephen hawking 91 176 93 91 177 93 at the british premiere of a film based on turing s life the imitation game the producers thanked leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing turing s pardon 91 178 93 leech is now regularly described as the architect of turing s pardon and subsequently the alan turing law which went on to secure pardons for 75 000 other men and women convicted of similar crimes 91 179 93 91 180 93 91 181 93 91 182 93 91 183 93 91 184 93 91 185 93 on 26 july 2012 a bill was introduced in the house of lords to grant a statutory pardon to turing for offences under section 11 of the criminal law amendment act 1885 of which he was convicted on 31 march 1952 91 186 93 late in the year in a letter to the daily telegraph the physicist stephen hawking and 10 other signatories including the astronomer royal lord rees president of the royal society sir paul nurse lady trumpington who worked for turing during the war and lord sharkey the bill s sponsor called on prime minister david cameron to act on the pardon request 91 187 93 the government indicated it would support the bill 91 188 93 91 189 93 91 190 93 and it passed its third reading in the house of lords in october 91 191 93 at the bill s second reading in the house of commons on 29 november 2013 conservative mp christopher chope objected to the bill delaying its passage the bill was due to return to the house of commons on 28 february 2014 91 192 93 but before the bill could be debated in the house of commons 91 193 93 the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy on 24 december 2013 queen elizabeth ii signed a pardon for turing s conviction for gross indecency with immediate effect 91 194 93 announcing the pardon lord chancellor chris grayling said turing deserved to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and not for his later criminal conviction 91 171 93 91 195 93 the queen officially pronounced turing pardoned in august 2014 91 196 93 the queen s action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the second world war 91 197 93 pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent and a request has been made by the family or other interested party neither condition was met in regard to turing s conviction 91 198 93 in september 2016 the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences in what was described as an alan turing law 91 199 93 91 200 93 the alan turing law is now an informal term for the law in the united kingdom contained in the policing and crime act 2017 which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts the law applies in england and
