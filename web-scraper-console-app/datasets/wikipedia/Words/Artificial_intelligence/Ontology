is the philosophical study of being as well as related concepts such as existence becoming and reality ontology addresses questions like how entities are grouped into categories and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level ontologists often try to determine what the categories or highest kinds are and how they form a system of categories that encompasses classification of all entities commonly proposed categories include substances properties relations states of affairs and events these categories are characterized by fundamental ontological concepts including particularity and universality abstractness and concreteness or possibility and necessity of special interest is the concept of ontological dependence which determines whether the entities of a category exist on the most fundamental level disagreements within ontology are often about whether entities belonging to a certain category exist and if so how they are related to other entities 91 1 93 when used as a countable noun the words ontology and ontologies refer not to the science of being but to theories within the science of being ontological theories can be divided into various types according to their theoretical commitments monocategorical ontologies hold that there is only one basic category but polycategorical ontologies rejected this view hierarchical ontologies assert that some entities exist on a more fundamental level and that other entities depend on them flat ontologies on the other hand deny such a privileged status to any entity contents 1 etymology 2 overview 2 1

records of the word itself is a new latin form ontologia which appeared in 1606 in the ogdoas scholastica by jacob lorhard lorhardus and in 1613 in the lexicon philosophicum by rudolf g ckel goclenius the first occurrence in english of ontology as recorded by the oxford english dictionary 91 4 93 came in 1664 through archelogia philosophica nova by gideon harvey 91 5 93 the word was first used in its latin form by philosophers and based on the latin roots and in turn on the greek ones overview edit being redirects here for other uses see being disambiguation ontology is closely associated with aristotle s question of being qua being the question of what all entities in the widest sense have in common 91 6 93 91 7 93 the eleatic principle is one answer to this question it states that being is inextricably tied to causation that power is the mark of being 91 6 93 one problem with this answer is that it excludes abstract objects another explicit but little accepted answer can be found in berkeley s slogan that to be is to be perceived 91 8 93 intimately related but not identical to the question of being qua being is the problem of categories 91 6 93 categories are usually seen as the highest kinds or genera 91 9 93 a system of categories provides a classification of entities that is exclusive and exhaustive every entity belongs to exactly one category various such classifications have been proposed they often include categories for substances properties relations states of affairs or events 91 6 93 91 10 93 at the core of the differentiation between categories are various fundamental ontological concepts and distinctions for example the concepts of particularity and universality of abstractness and concreteness of ontological dependence of identity and of modality 91 6 93 91 10 93 these concepts are sometimes treated as categories themselves are used to explain the difference between categories or play other central roles for characterizing different ontological theories within ontology there is a lack of general consensus concerning how the different categories are to be defined 91 9 93 different ontologists often disagree on whether a certain category has any members at all or whether a given category is fundamental 91 10 93 particulars and universals edit particulars or individuals are usually contrasted with universals 91 11 93 91 12 93 universals concern features that can be exemplified by various different particulars 91 13 93 for example a tomato and a strawberry are two particulars that exemplify the universal redness universals can be present at various distinct locations in space at the same time while particulars are restricted to one location at a time furthermore universals can be fully present at different times which is why they are sometimes referred to as repeatables in contrast to non repeatable particulars 91 10 93 the so called problem of universals is the problem to explain how different things can agree in their features e g how a tomato and a strawberry can both be red 91 6 93 91 13 93 realists about universals believe that there are universals they can solve the problem of universals by explaining the commonality through a universal shared by both entities 91 10 93 realists are divided among themselves as to whether universals can exist independently of being exemplified by something ante res or not in rebus 91 14 93 nominalists on the other hand deny that there are universals they have to resort to other notions to explain how a feature can be common to several entities for example by positing either fundamental resemblance relations between the entities resemblance nominalism or a shared membership to a common natural class class nominalism 91 10 93 abstract and concrete edit main article abstract and concrete many philosophers agree that there is an exclusive and exhaustive distinction between concrete objects and abstract objects 91 10 93 some philosophers consider this to be the most general division of being 91 15 93 examples of concrete objects include plants human beings and planets while things like numbers sets and propositions are abstract objects 91 16 93 but despite the general agreement concerning the paradigm cases there is less consensus as to what the characteristic marks of concreteness and abstractness are popular suggestions include defining the distinction in terms of the difference between 1 existence inside or outside space time 2 having causes and effects or not and 3 having contingent or necessary existence 91 17 93 91 18 93 ontological dependence edit main article grounding metaphysics an entity ontologically depends on another entity if the first entity cannot exist without the second entity ontologically independent entities on the other hand can exist all by themselves 91 19 93 for example the surface of an apple cannot exist without the apple and so depends on it ontologically 91 20 93 entities often characterized as ontologically dependent include properties which depend on their bearers and boundaries which depend on the entity they demarcate from its surroundings 91 21 93 as these examples suggest ontological dependence is to be distinguished from causal dependence in which an effect depends for its existence on a cause it is often important to draw a distinction between two types of ontological dependence rigid and generic 91 21 93 91 10 93 rigid dependence concerns the dependence on one specific entity as the surface of an apple depends on its specific apple 91 22 93 generic dependence on the other hand involves a weaker form of dependence on merely a certain type of entity for example electricity generically depends on there being charged particles but it does not depend on any specific charged particle 91 21 93 dependence relations are relevant to ontology since it is often held that ontologically dependent entities have a less robust form of being this way a hierarchy is introduced into the world that brings with it the distinction between more and less fundamental entities 91 21 93 identity edit identity is a basic ontological concept that is often expressed by the word same 91 10 93 91 23 93 it is important to distinguish between qualitative identity and numerical identity for example consider two children with identical bicycles engaged in a race while their mother is watching the two children have the same bicycle in one sense qualitative identity and the same mother in another sense numerical identity 91 10 93 two qualitatively identical things are often said to be indiscernible the two senses of sameness are linked by two principles the principle of indiscernibility of identicals and the principle of identity of indiscernibles the principle of indiscernibility of identicals is uncontroversial and states that if two entities are numerically identical with each other then they exactly resemble each other 91 23 93 the principle of identity of indiscernibles on the other hand is more controversial in making the converse claim that if two entities exactly resemble each other then they must be numerically identical 91 23 93 this entails that no two distinct things exactly resemble each other 91 24 93 a well known counterexample comes from max black who describes a symmetrical universe consisting of only two spheres with the same features 91 25 93 black argues that the two spheres are indiscernible but not identical thereby constituting a violation of the principle of identity of indiscernibles 91 26 93 the problem of identity over time concerns the question of persistence whether or in what sense two objects at different times can be numerically identical this is usually referred to as diachronic identity in contrast to synchronic identity 91 23 93 91 27 93 the statement that t he table in the next room is identical with the one you purchased last year asserts diachronic identity between the table now and the table then 91 27 93 a famous example of a denial of diachronic identity comes from heraclitus who argues that it is impossible to step into the same river twice because of the changes that occurred in between 91 23 93 91 28 93 the traditional position on the problem of persistence is endurantism the thesis that diachronic identity in a strict sense is possible one problem with this position is that it seems to violate the principle of indiscernibility of identicals the object may have undergone changes in the meantime resulting in it being discernible from itself 91 10 93 perdurantism or four dimensionalism is an alternative approach holding that diachronic identity is possible only in a loose sense while the two objects differ from each other strictly speaking they are both temporal parts that belong to the same temporally extended whole 91 10 93 91 29 93 perdurantism avoids many philosophical problems plaguing endurantism but endurantism seems to be more in touch with how we ordinarily conceive diachronic identity 91 27 93 91 28 93 modality edit modality concerns the concepts of possibility actuality and necessity in contemporary discourse these concepts are often defined in terms of possible worlds 91 10 93 a possible world is a complete way how things could have been 91 30 93 the actual world is one possible world among others things could have been different from what they actually are a proposition is possibly true if there is at least one possible world in which it is true it is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds 91 31 93 actualists and possibilists disagree on the ontological status of possible worlds 91 10 93 actualists hold that reality is at its core actual and that possible worlds should be understood in terms of actual entities for example as fictions or as sets of sentences 91 32 93 possibilists on the other hand assign to possible worlds the same fundamental ontological status as to the actual world this is a form of modal realism holding that reality has irreducibly modal features 91 32 93 another important issue in this field concerns the distinction between contingent and necessary beings 91 10 93 contingent beings are beings whose existence is possible but not necessary necessary beings on the other hand could not have failed to exist 91 33 93 91 34 93 it has been suggested that this distinction is the highest division of being 91 10 93 91 35 93 substances edit the category of substances has played a central role in many ontological theories throughout the history of philosophy 91 36 93 91 37 93 substance is a technical term within philosophy not to be confused with the more common usage in the sense of chemical substances like gold or sulfur various definitions have been given but among the most common features ascribed to substances in the philosophical sense is that they are particulars that are ontologically independent they are able to exist all by themselves 91 36 93 91 6 93 being ontologically independent substances can play the role of fundamental entities in the ontological hierarchy 91 21 93 91 37 93 if ontological independence is defined as including causal independence then only self caused entities like spinoza s god can be substances with a specifically ontological definition of independence many everyday objects like books or cats may qualify as substances 91 6 93 91 36 93 another defining feature often attributed to substances is their ability to undergo changes changes involve something existing before during and after the change they can be described in terms of a persisting substance gaining or losing properties or of matter changing its form 91 36 93 from this perspective the ripening of a tomato may be described as a change in which the tomato loses its greenness and gains its redness it is sometimes held that a substance can have a property in two ways essentially and accidentally a substance can survive a change of accidental properties but it cannot lose its essential properties which constitute its nature 91 37 93 91 38 93 properties and relations edit main articles property philosophy and relations philosophy the category of properties consists of entities that can be exemplified by other entities e g by substances 91 39 93 properties characterize their bearers they express what their bearer is like 91 6 93 for example the red color and the round shape of an apple are properties of this apple various ways have been suggested concerning how to conceive properties themselves and their relation to substances 91 10 93 the traditionally dominant view is that properties are universals that inhere in their bearers 91 6 93 as universals they can be shared by different substances nominalists on the other hand deny that universals exist 91 13 93 some nominalists try to account for properties in terms of resemblance relations or class membership 91 10 93 another alternative for nominalists is to conceptualize properties as simple particulars so called tropes 91 6 93 this position entails that both the apple and its redness are particulars different apples may still exactly resemble each other concerning their color but they do not share the same particular property on this view the two color tropes are numerically distinct 91 13 93 another important question for any theory of properties is how to conceive the relation between a bearer and its properties 91 10 93 substratum theorists hold that there is some kind of substance substratum or bare particular that acts as bearer 91 40 93 bundle theory is an alternative view that does away with a substratum altogether objects are taken to be just a bundle of properties 91 37 93 91 41 93 they are held together not by a substratum but by the so called compresence relation responsible for the bundling both substratum theory and bundle theory can be combined with conceptualizing properties as universals or as particulars 91 40 93 an important distinction among properties is between categorical and dispositional properties 91 6 93 91 42 93 categorical properties concern what something is like e g what qualities it has dispositional properties on the other hand involve what powers something has what it is able to do even if it is not actually doing it 91 6 93 for example the shape of a sugar cube is a categorical property while its tendency to dissolve in water is a dispositional property for many properties there is a lack of consensus as to how they should be classified for example whether colors are categorical or dispositional properties 91 43 93 91 44 93 categoricalism is the thesis that on a fundamental level there are only categorical properties that dispositional properties are either non existent or dependent on categorical properties dispositionalism is the opposite theory giving ontological primacy to dispositional properties 91 43 93 91 42 93 between these two extremes there are dualists who allow both categorical and dispositional properties in their ontology 91 39 93 relations are ways in which things the relata stand to each other 91 6 93 91 45 93 relations are in many ways similar to properties in that both characterize the things they apply to properties are sometimes treated as a special case of relations involving only one relatum 91 39 93 central for ontology is the distinction between internal and external relations 91 46 93 a relation is internal if it is fully determined by the features of its relata 91 47 93 for example an apple and a tomato stand in the internal relation of similarity to each other because they are both red 91 48 93 some philosophers have inferred from this that internal relations do not have a proper ontological status since they can be reduced to intrinsic properties 91 46 93 91 49 93 external relations on the other hand are not fixed by the features of their relata for example a book stands in an external relation to a table by lying on top of it but this is not determined by the book s or the table s features like their color their shape etc 91 46 93 states of affairs and events edit states of affairs are complex entities in contrast to substances and properties which are usually conceived as simple 91 6 93 91 50 93 complex entities are built up from or constituted by other entities atomic states of affairs are constituted by one particular and one property exemplified by this particular 91 10 93 91 51 93 for example the state of affairs that socrates is wise is constituted by the particular socrates and the property wise relational states of affairs involve several particulars and a relation connecting them states of affairs that obtain are also referred to as facts 91 51 93 it is controversial which ontological status should be ascribed to states of affairs that do not obtain 91 10 93 states of affairs have been prominent in 20th century ontology as various theories were proposed to describe the world as composed of states of affairs 91 6 93 91 52 93 91 53 93 it is often held that states of affairs play the role of truthmakers judgments or assertions are true because the corresponding state of affairs obtains 91 51 93 91 54 93 events take place in time they are sometimes thought of as involving a change in the form of acquiring or losing a property like the lawn s becoming dry 91 55 93 but on a liberal view the retaining of a property without any change may also count as an event e g the lawn s staying wet 91 55 93 91 56 93 some philosophers see events as universals that can repeat at different times but the more dominant view is that events are particulars and therefore non repeatable 91 56 93 some events are complex in that they are composed of a sequence of events often referred to as a process 91 57 93 but even simple events can be conceived as complex entities involving an object a time and the property exemplified by the object at this time 91 58 93 91 59 93 so called process philosophy or process ontology ascribes ontological primacy to changes and processes as opposed to the emphasis on static being in the traditionally dominant substance metaphysics 91 60 93 91 61 93 reality of things edit the word real is derived from the latin word res which is often translated as thing the word thing is often used in ontological discourse as if it had a presupposed meaning not needing an explicit philosophical definition because it belongs to ordinary language nevertheless what is a thing and what is real or substantial are concerns of ontology 91 22 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 91 64 93 91 65 93 different views are held about this plato proposed that underlying and constituting the real basis of the concretely experienced world are forms or ideas which today are generally regarded as high abstractions in earlier days philosophers used the term realism to refer to plato s belief that his forms are real nowadays the term realism often has an almost opposite meaning so that plato s belief is sometimes called idealism 91 66 93 philosophers debate whether entities such as tables and chairs lions and tigers philosophical doctrines numbers truth and beauty are to be regarded as things or as something or nothing real types of ontologies edit ontological theories can be divided into various types according to their theoretical commitments particular ontological theories or types of theories are often referred to as ontologies singular or plural this usage contrasts with the meaning of ontology only singular as a branch of philosophy the science of being in general 91 67 93 91 68 93 flat vs polycategorical vs hierarchical edit one way to divide ontologies is by the number of basic categories they use monocategorical or one category ontologies hold that there is only one basic category while polycategorical ontologies imply that there are several distinct basic categories 91 69 93 91 70 93 91 71 93 another way to divide ontologies is through the notion of ontological hierarchy hierarchical ontologies assert that some entities exist on a more fundamental level and that other entities depend on them flat ontologies on the other hand deny such a privileged status to any entities 91 72 93 91 73 93 jonathan schaffer provides an overview of these positions by distinguishing between flat ontologies non hierarchical sorted ontologies polycategorical non hierarchical and ordered ontologies polycategorical hierarchical 91 74 93 flat ontologies are only interested in the difference between existence and non existence they are flat because each flat ontology can be represented by a simple set containing all the entities to which this ontology is committed an influential exposition 91 75 93 of this approach comes from willard van orman quine which is why it has been referred to as the quinean approach to meta ontology 91 74 93 91 76 93 this outlook does not deny that the existing entities can be further subdivided and may stand in various relations to each other these issues are questions for the more specific sciences but they do not belong to ontology in the quinean sense polycategorical ontologies are concerned with the categories of being each polycategorical ontology posits a number of categories these categories are exclusive and exhaustive every existing entity belongs to exactly one category 91 74 93 a recent example of a polycategorical ontology is e j lowe s four category ontology 91 77 93 the four categories are object kind mode and attribute the fourfold structure is based on two distinctions the first distinction is between substantial entities objects and kinds and non substantial entities modes and attributes the second distinction is between particular entities objects and modes and universal entities kinds and attributes reality is built up through the interplay of entities belonging to different categories particular entities instantiate universal entities and non substantial entities characterize substantial entities 91 77 93 91 78 93 hierarchical ontologies are interested in the degree of fundamentality of the entities they posit their main goal is to figure out which entities are fundamental and how the non fundamental entities depend on them the concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of metaphysical grounding 91 79 93 fundamental entities are different from non fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities 91 74 93 91 80 93 for example it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects like chairs and tables they compose this is a claim about the grounding relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects schaffer s priority monism is a recent form of a hierarchical ontology he holds that on the most fundamental level there exists only one thing the world as a whole this thesis does not deny our common sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist it only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence 91 81 93 an example of a hierarchical ontology in continental philosophy comes from nicolai hartmann he asserts that reality is made up of four levels the inanimate the biological the psychological and the spiritual 91 82 93 these levels form a hierarchy in the sense that the higher levels depend on the lower levels while the lower levels are indifferent to the higher levels 91 83 93 thing ontologies vs fact ontologies edit thing ontologies and fact ontologies are one category ontologies they both hold that all fundamental entities belong to the same category they disagree on whether this category is the category of things or of facts 91 84 93 91 85 93 91 86 93 a slogan for fact ontologies comes from ludwig wittgenstein the world is the totality of facts not of things 91 87 93 one difficulty in characterizing this dispute is to elucidate what things and facts are and how they differ from each other things are commonly contrasted with the properties and relations they instantiate 91 88 93 facts on the other hand are often characterized as having these things and the properties relations as their constituents 91 89 93 this is reflected in a rough linguistic characterization of this difference where the subjects and objects of an assertion refer to things while the assertion as a whole refers to a fact 91 90 93 reism is one form of thing ontology 91 91 93 franz brentano developed a version of reism in his later philosophy he held that only concrete particular things exist things can exist in two forms either as spatio temporal bodies or as temporal souls brentano was aware of the fact that many common sense expressions seem to refer to entities that do not have a place in his ontology like properties or intentional objects this is why he developed a method to paraphrase these expressions in order to avoid these ontological commitments 91 91 93 d m armstrong is a well known defender of fact ontology he and his followers refer to facts as states of affairs 91 89 93 states of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology they have particulars and universals as their constituents but they are primary in relation to particulars and universals states of affairs have ontologically independent existence while u npropertied particulars and uninstantiated universals are false abstractions 91 89 93 constituent ontologies vs blob theories edit constituent ontologies and blob theories sometimes referred to as relational ontologies are concerned with the internal structure of objects constituent ontologies hold that objects have an internal structure made up of constituents this is denied by blob theories they contend that objects are structureless blobs 91 88 93 91 92 93 91 69 93 91 93 93 bundle theories are examples of constituent ontologies bundle theorists assert that an object is nothing but the properties it has on this account a regular apple could be characterized as a bundle of redness roundness sweetness etc defenders of bundle theory disagree on the nature of the bundled properties some affirm that these properties are universals while others contend that they are particulars so called tropes 91 88 93 91 94 93 class nominalism on the other hand is a form of blob theory class nominalists hold that properties are classes of things to instantiate a property is merely to be a member of the corresponding class so properties are not constituents of the objects that have them 91 88 93 91 95 93 information science and natural sciences edit in information science ontologies are classified in various ways using criteria such as the degree of abstraction and field of application 91 96 93 upper ontology concepts supporting development of an ontology meta ontology domain ontology concepts relevant to a particular topic domain of discourse or area of interest for example to information technology or to computer languages or to particular branches of science interface ontology concepts relevant to the juncture of two disciplines process ontology inputs outputs constraints sequencing information involved in business or engineering processes in the biomedical sciences ontologies have been used to create terminologies for various aspects of living organism or medical applications a prominent example is the gene ontology but many other ontologies exist e g for anatomical terms or physiology 91 97 93 standards have been established to maintain and organize biological ontologies under the obo open biological ontologies project 91 97 93 history edit ancient greek edit parmenides was among the first to propose an

in the greek philosophical tradition parmenides was among the first to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of existence in the prologue or proem to on nature he describes two views of existence initially nothing comes from nothing thus existence is eternal this posits that existence is what may be conceived of by thought created or possessed hence there may be neither void nor vacuum and true reality neither may come into being nor vanish from existence rather the entirety of creation is eternal uniform and immutable though not infinite parmenides characterized its shape as that of a perfect sphere parmenides thus posits that change as perceived in everyday experience is illusory opposite to the eleatic monism of parmenides is the pluralistic conception of being in the 5th century bc anaxagoras and leucippus replaced 91 98 93 the reality of being unique and unchanging with that of becoming therefore by a more fundamental and elementary ontic plurality this thesis originated in the hellenic world stated in two different ways by anaxagoras and by leucippus the first theory dealt with seeds which aristotle referred to as homeomeries of the various substances the second was the atomistic theory 91 99 93 which dealt with reality as based on the vacuum the atoms and their intrinsic movement in it 91 100 93 the materialist atomism proposed by leucippus was indeterminist but democritus c 460 c 370 bc subsequently developed it in a deterministic way later 4th century bc epicurus took the original atomism again as indeterministic he saw reality as composed of an infinity of indivisible unchangeable corpuscles or atoms from the greek atomon lit uncuttable but he gives weight to characterize atoms whereas for leucippus they are characterized by a figure an order and a position in the cosmos 91 101 93 atoms are besides creating the whole with the intrinsic movement in the vacuum producing the diverse flux of being their movement is influenced by the parenklisis lucretius names it clinamen and that is determined by chance these ideas foreshadowed the understanding of traditional physics until the advent of 20th century theories on the nature of atoms 91 102 93 91 page 160 needed 93 plato edit plato developed the distinction between true reality and illusion in arguing that what is real are eternal and unchanging forms or ideas a precursor to universals of which things experienced in sensation are at best merely copies and real only in so far as they copy partake of such forms in general plato presumes that all nouns e g beauty refer to real entities whether sensible bodies or insensible forms hence in the sophist plato argues that being is a form in which all existent things participate and which they have in common though it is unclear whether being is intended in the sense of existence copula or identity and argues against parmenides that forms must exist not only of being but also of negation and of non being or difference 91 citation needed 93 aristotle edit in his categories aristotle 384 322 bce identifies ten possible kinds of things that may be the subject or the predicate

descartes has been central to many disputes in the western philosophical tradition 91 105 93 58 8202 845 8202 samkhya sees the mind as being the subtle part of prak ti it is made up of three faculties the sense mind manas the intellect buddhi and the ego aha k ra these faculties perform various functions but are by themselves unable to produce consciousness which belongs to a distinct ontological category and for which puru a alone is responsible 91 106 93 91 105 93 the yoga school agrees with samkhya philosophy on the fundamental dualism between puru a and prak ti but it differs from samkhya s atheistic position by incorporating the concept of a personal yet essentially inactive deity or personal god ishvara 91 107 93 91 108 93 91 109 93 91 110 93 these two schools stand in contrast to advaita vedanta which adheres to non duality by revealing that the apparent plurality of things is an illusion maya hiding the true oneness of reality at its most fundamental level brahman 91 111 93 91 112 93 medieval edit medieval ontology was strongly influenced by aristotle s teachings the thinkers of this period often relied on aristotelian categories like substance act and potency or matter and form to formulate their own theories important ontologists in this epoch include avicenna thomas aquinas duns scotus and william of ockham 91 113 93 91 114 93 91 115 93 avicenna edit according to avicenna s interpretation of greek aristotelian and platonist ontological doctrines in medieval metaphysics being is either necessary contingent qua possible or impossible necessary being is that which cannot but be since its non being would entail a contradiction contingent qua possible being is neither necessary nor impossible for it to be or not to be it is ontologically neutral and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence its being is borrowed unlike the necessary existent which is self subsisting and impossible not to be as for the impossible it necessarily does not exist and the affirmation of its being would involve a contradiction 91 116 93 aquinas edit fundamental to thomas aquinas s ontology is his distinction between essence and existence all entities are conceived as composites of essence and existence 91 117 93 91 118 93 91 119 93 the essence of a thing is what this thing is like it signifies the definition of this thing 91 120 93 god has a special status since he is the only entity whose essence is identical to its existence but for all other finite entities there is a real distinction between essence and existence 91 121 93 this distinction shows itself for example in our ability to understand the essence of something without knowing about its existence 91 122 93 aquinas conceives of existence as an act of being that actualizes the potency given by the essence different things have different essences which impose different limits on the corresponding act of being 91 117 93 the paradigm examples of essence existence composites are material substances like cats or trees aquinas incorporates aristotle s distinction between matter and form by holding that the essence of material things as opposed to the essence of immaterial things like angels is the composition of their matter and form 91 117 93 91 123 93 so for example the essence of a marble statue would be the composition of the marble its matter and the shape it has its form form is universal since substances made of different matter can have the same form the forms of a substance may be divided into substantial and accidental forms a substance can survive a change of an accidental form but ceases to exist upon a change of a substantial form 91 117 93 modern edit ontology is increasingly seen as a separate domain of philosophy in the modern period 91 115 93 91 124 93 many ontological theories of this period were rationalistic in the sense that they saw ontology largely as a deductive discipline that starts from a small set of first principles or axioms a position best exemplified by baruch spinoza and christian wolff this rationalism in metaphysics and ontology was strongly opposed by immanuel kant who insisted that many claims arrived at this way are to be dismissed since they go beyond any possible experience that could justify them 91 125 93 91 126 93 descartes edit ren descartes ontological distinction between mind and body has been one of the most influential parts of his philosophy 91 127 93 91 126 93 on his view minds are thinking things while bodies are extended things thought and extension are two attributes that each come in various modes of being modes of thinking include judgments doubts volitions sensations and emotions while the shapes of material things are modes of extension 91 128 93 modes come with a lower degree of reality since they depend for their existence on a substance 91 129 93 substances on the other hand can exist on their own 91 128 93 descartes substance dualism asserts that every finite substance is either a thinking substance or an extended substance 91 130 93 91 131 93 this position does not entail that minds and bodies actually are separated from each other which would defy the intuition that we both have a body and a mind instead it implies that minds and bodies can at least in principle be separated since they are distinct substances and therefore are capable of independent existence 91 127 93 91 132 93 a longstanding problem for substance dualism since its inception has been to explain how minds and bodies can causally interact with each other as they apparently do when a volition causes an arm to move or when light falling on the retina causes a visual impression 91 127 93 spinoza edit baruch spinoza is well known for his substance monism the thesis that only one substance exists 91 133 93 91 126 93 he refers to this substance as god or nature emphasizing both his pantheism and his naturalism 91 134 93 this substance has an infinite amount of attributes which he defines as what the intellect perceives of substance as constituting its essence 91 135 93 of these attributes only two are accessible to the human mind thought and extension modes are properties of a substance that follow from its attributes and therefore have only a dependent form of existence 91 136 93 spinoza sees everyday things like rocks cats or ourselves as mere modes and thereby opposes the traditional aristotelian and cartesian conception of categorizing them as substances 91 137 93 modes compose deterministic systems in which the different modes are linked to each other as cause and effect 91 133 93 each deterministic system corresponds to one attribute one for extended things one for thinking things etc causal relations only happen within a system while the different systems run in parallel without causally interacting with each other 91 137 93 spinoza calls the system of modes natura naturata nature natured and opposes it to natura naturans nature naturing the attributes responsible for the modes 91 138 93 everything in spinoza s system is necessary there are no contingent entities this is so since the attributes are themselves necessary and since the system of modes follows from them 91 133 93 wolff edit christian wolff defines ontology as the science of being in general he sees it as a part of metaphysics besides cosmology psychology and natural theology 91 139 93 91 140 93 91 141 93 according to wolff it is a deductive science knowable a priori and based on two fundamental principles the principle of non contradiction it cannot happen that the same thing is and is not and the principle of sufficient reason nothing exists without a sufficient reason for why it exists rather than does not exist 91 139 93 91 126 93 beings are defined by their determinations or predicates which cannot involve a contradiction determinates come in 3 types essentialia attributes and modes 91 139 93 essentialia define the nature of a being and are therefore necessary properties of this being attributes are determinations that follow from essentialia and are equally necessary in contrast to modes which are merely contingent wolff conceives existence as just one determination among others which a being may lack 91 140 93 ontology is interested in being at large not just in actual being but all beings whether actually existing or not have a sufficient reason 91 125 93 the sufficient reason for things without actual existence consists in all the determinations that make up the essential nature of this thing wolff refers to this as a reason of being and contrasts it with a reason of becoming which explains why some things have actual existence 91 140 93 schopenhauer edit arthur schopenhauer was a proponent of metaphysical voluntarism 91 142 93 he regards will as the underlying and ultimate reality 91 143 93 reality as a whole consists only of one will which is equated with the kantian thing in itself like the kantian thing in itself the will exists outside space and time but unlike the kantian thing in itself the will has an experiential component to it it comes in the form of striving desiring feeling etc 91 144 93 91 145 93 the manifold of things we encounter in our everyday experiences like trees or cars are mere appearances that lack existence independent of the observer schopenhauer describes them as objectivations of the will these objectivations happen in different steps which correspond to the platonic forms 91 146 93 all objectivations are grounded in the will this grounding is governed by the principium individuationis which enables a manifold of individual things spread out in space and time to be grounded in the one will 91 147 93 20th century edit dominant approaches to ontology in the 20th century were phenomenology linguistic analysis and naturalism phenomenological ontology as exemplified by edmund husserl and martin heidegger relies for its method on the description of experience linguistic analysis assigns to language a central role for ontology as seen for example in rudolf carnap s thesis that the truth value of existence claims depends on the linguistic framework in which they are made naturalism gives a prominent position to the natural sciences for the purpose of finding and evaluating ontological claims this position is exemplified by quine s method of ontology which involves analyzing the ontological commitments of scientific theories 91 126 93 91 115 93 husserl edit edmund husserl sees ontology as a science of essences 91 115 93 sciences of essences are contrasted with factual sciences the former are knowable a priori and provide the foundation for the later which are knowable a posteriori 91 126 93 91 148 93 ontology as a science of essences is not interested in actual facts but in the essences themselves whether they have instances or not 91 149 93 husserl distinguishes between formal ontology which investigates the essence of objectivity in general 91 150 93 and regional ontologies which study regional essences that are shared by all entities belonging to the region 91 115 93 regions correspond to the highest genera of concrete entities material nature personal consciousness and interpersonal spirit 91 151 93 91 152 93 husserl s method for studying ontology and sciences of essence in general is called eidetic variation 91 148 93 it involves imagining an object of the kind under investigation and varying its features 91 153 93 the changed feature is inessential to this kind if the object can survive its change otherwise it belongs to the kind s essence for example a triangle remains a triangle if one of its sides is extended but it ceases to be a triangle if a fourth side is added regional ontology involves applying this method to the essences corresponding to the highest genera 91 154 93 heidegger edit central to martin heidegger s philosophy is the notion of ontological difference the difference between being as such and specific entities 91 155 93 91 156 93 he accuses the philosophical tradition of being forgetful of this distinction which has led to the mistake of understanding being as such as a kind of ultimate entity for example as idea energeia substance monad or will to power 91 155 93 91 115 93 91 157 93 heidegger tries to rectify this mistake in his own fundamental ontology by focusing on the meaning of being instead a project which is akin to contemporary meta ontology 91 158 93 91 159 93 one method to achieve this is by studying the human being or dasein in heidegger s terminology 91 126 93 the reason for this is that we already have a pre ontological understanding of being that shapes how we experience the world phenomenology can be used to make this implicit understanding explicit but it has to be accompanied by hermeneutics in order to avoid the distortions due to the forgetfulness of being 91 155 93 in his later philosophy heidegger attempted to reconstruct the history of being in order to show how the different epochs in the history of philosophy were dominated by different conceptions of being 91 160 93 his goal is to retrieve the original experience of being present in the early greek thought that was covered up by later philosophers 91 157 93 hartmann edit nicolai hartmann is a 20th century philosopher within the continental tradition of philosophy he interprets ontology as aristotle s science of being qua being the science of the most general characteristics of entities usually referred to as categories and the relations between them 91 161 93 91 162 93 91 163 93 according to hartmann the most general categories are moments of being existence and essence modes of being reality and ideality and modalities of being possibility actuality and necessity every entity has both existence and essence 91 164 93 reality and ideality by contrast are two disjunctive categories every entity is either real or ideal ideal entities are universal returnable and always existing while real entities are individual unique and destructible 91 165 93 among the ideal entities are mathematical objects and values 91 166 93 the modalities of being are divided into the absolute modalities actuality and non actuality and the relative modalities possibility impossibility and necessity the relative modalities are relative in the sense that they depend on the absolute modalities something is possible impossible or necessary because something else is actual hartmann asserts that reality is made up of four levels inanimate biological psychological and spiritual that form a hierarchy 91 82 93 91 83 93 carnap edit rudolf carnap proposed that the truth value of ontological statements about the existence of entities depends on the linguistic framework in which these statements are made they are internal to the framework 91 1 93 91 115 93 as such they are often trivial in that it just depends on the rules and definitions within this framework for example it follows analytically from the rules and definitions within the mathematical framework that numbers exist 91 167 93 the problem carnap saw with traditional ontologists is that they try to make framework independent or external statements about what really is the case 91 126 93 91 168 93 such statements are at best pragmatic considerations about which framework to choose and at worst outright meaningless according to carnap 91 169 93 for example there is no matter of fact as to whether realism or idealism is true their truth depends on the adopted framework 91 170 93 the job of philosophers is not to discover which things exist by themselves but conceptual engineering to create interesting frameworks and to explore the consequences of adopting them 91 167 93 91 1 93 the choice of framework is guided by practical considerations like expedience or fruitfulness since there is no framework independent notion of truth 91 171 93 quine edit the notion of ontological commitment plays a central role in willard van orman quine s contributions to ontology 91 172 93 91 173 93 a theory is ontologically committed to an entity if that entity must exist in order for the theory to be true 91 174 93 quine proposed that the best way to determine this is by translating the theory in question into first order predicate logic of special interest in this translation are the logical constants known as existential quantifiers whose meaning corresponds to expressions like there exists or for some they are used to bind the variables in the expression following the quantifier 91 175 93 the ontological commitments of the theory then correspond to the variables bound by existential quantifiers 91 176 93 this approach is summed up by quine s famous dictum that t o be is to be the value of a variable 91 177 93 this method by itself is not sufficient for ontology since it depends on a theory in order to result in ontological commitments quine proposed that we should base our ontology on our best scientific theory 91 174 93 various followers of quine s method chose to apply it to different fields for example to everyday conceptions expressed in natural language 91 178 93 91 179 93 other ontological topics edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this

learn how and when to remove this template message ontological formations edit the concept of ontological formations refers to formations of social relations understood as dominant ways of living temporal spatial corporeal epistemological and performative relations are taken to be central to understanding a dominant formation that is a particular ontological formation is based on how ontological categories of time space embodiment knowing and performing are lived objectively and subjectively different ontological formations include the customary including the tribal the traditional the modern and the postmodern the concept was first introduced by paul james in 2006 together with a series of writers including damian grenfell and manfred steger 91 180 93 in the engaged theory approach ontological formations are seen as layered and intersecting rather than singular formations they are formations of being this approach avoids the usual problems of a great divide being posited between the modern and the pre modern from a philosophical distinction concerning different formations of being the concept then provides a way of translating into practical understandings concerning how humans might design cities and communities that live creatively across different ontological formations for example cities that are not completely dominated by modern valences of spatial configuration here the work of tony fry is important 91 181 93 ontology of fictional characters edit according to edward n zalta the ontology of fiction analyses such sentences as 91 182 93 nero worshipped the god mars mars the god does not exist and eliza doolittle in george bernard shaw s pygmalion is a flower girl according to amie l thomasson fictional discourse can be of four sorts uttered within works of fiction philosophical exercises such as captain marvel does not exist treating fictional characters as if they were real such as superman can leap tall buildings and discourse about works of fiction such as professor higgins was created by george bernard shaw 91 183 93 jeremy bentham distinguished three kinds of entities 91 184 93 the real those that can be perceived or can be inferred from perception the fictitious abstractions that referred to perceptible things the fabulous those that can be found only in the imagination where the word exist applies to such only in the sense that they do not really exist francis herbert bradley thought that real things exist respectively at particular times and places he recognised several kinds of entity 91 185 93 the genuinely historical the fictional the real the merely imagined the existent and the non existent alexius meinong would put fictional entities into the category which he called subsistence 91 186 93 this category contains objects that neither exist spatially or non spatially however they do have properties the properties are given to these objects in the way they are said to be described for example we can talk about the tall unicorn even though the tall unicorn does not exist we can say the unicorn is in fact tall because this follows from the properties in which the object is characterized 91 186 93 ontological and epistemological certainty edit ren descartes with cogito ergo sum je pense donc je suis i think therefore i am argued that a person s thinking agency his res cogitans as distinct from his material body his res extensa is something that we can know exists with epistemological certainty descartes argued further that this knowledge could lead to a proof of the certainty of the existence of god using the ontological argument that had been formulated first by anselm of canterbury 91 187 93 body and environment questioning the meaning of being edit schools of subjectivism objectivism and relativism existed at various times in the 20th century and the postmodernists and body philosophers tried to reframe all these questions in terms of bodies taking some specific action in an environment this relied to a great degree on insights derived from scientific research into animals taking instinctive action in natural and artificial settings as studied by biology ecology 91 188 93 and cognitive science 91 citation needed 93 the processes by which bodies related to environments became of great concern and the idea of being itself became difficult to really define what did people mean when they said a is b a must be b a was b some linguists advocated dropping the verb to be from the english language leaving e 160 prime supposedly less prone to bad abstractions others mostly philosophers tried to dig into the word and its usage martin heidegger distinguished human being as existence from the being of things in the world heidegger proposes that our way of being human and the way the world is for us are cast historically through a fundamental ontological questioning these fundamental ontological categories provide the basis for communication in an age a horizon of unspoken and seemingly unquestionable background meanings such as human beings understood unquestioningly as subjects and other entities understood unquestioningly as objects because these basic ontological meanings both generate and are regenerated in everyday interactions the locus of our way of being in a historical epoch is the communicative event of language in use 91 189 93 for heidegger however communication in the first place is not among human beings but language itself shapes up in response to questioning the inexhaustible meaning of being 91 190 93 even the focus of traditional ontology on the whatness or quidditas of beings in their substantial standing presence can be shifted to pose the question of the whoness of human being itself 91 191 93 ontology and language edit some philosophers suggest that the question of what is is at least in part an issue of usage rather than a question about facts 91 192 93 this perspective is conveyed by an analogy made by donald davidson suppose a person refers to a cup as a chair and makes some comments pertinent to a cup but uses the word chair consistently throughout instead of cup one might readily catch on that this person simply calls a cup a chair and the oddity is explained 91 193 93 analogously if we find people asserting there are such and such and we do not ourselves think that such and such exist we might conclude that these people are not nuts davidson calls this assumption charity they simply use there are differently than we do the question of what is is at least partly a topic in the philosophy of language and is not entirely about ontology itself 91 194 93 this viewpoint has been expressed by eli hirsch 91 195 93 91 196 93 hirsch interprets hilary putnam as asserting that different concepts of the existence of something can be correct 91 196 93 this position does not contradict the view that some things do exist but points out that different languages will have different rules about assigning this property 91 196 93 91 197 93 how to determine the fitness of a language to the world then becomes a subject for investigation common to all indo european copula languages is the double use of the verb to be in both stating that entity x exists x is as well as stating that x has a property x is p it is sometimes argued that a third use is also distinct stating that x is a member of a class x is a c in other language families these roles may have completely different verbs and are less likely to be confused with one another for example they might say something like the car has redness rather than the car is red hence any discussion of being in indo european language philosophy may need to make distinctions between these senses 91 citation needed 93 ontology and human geography edit in human geography there are two types of ontology small o which accounts for the practical orientation describing functions of being a part of the group thought to oversimplify and ignore key activities the other o or big o systematically logically and rationally describes the essential characteristics and universal traits this concept relates closely to plato s view that the human mind can only perceive a bigger world if they continue to live within the confines of their caves however in spite of the differences ontology relies on the symbolic agreements among members that said ontology is crucial for the axiomatic language frameworks 91 198 93 anthropology edit the topic of ontology has received increased attention in anthropology since the 1990s this is sometimes termed the ontological turn 91 199 93 this type of inquiry is focused on how people from different cultures experience and understand the nature of being specific interest in this regard has been given to the ontological outlook of indigenous people and how their outlook tends to differ from a more western perspective 91 199 93 91 200 93 as an example of this contrast it has been argued that various indigenous communities ascribe intentionality to non human entities like plants forests or rivers this outlook is known as animism 91 201 93 reality and actuality edit according to alfred n whitehead for ontology it is useful to distinguish the terms reality and actuality in this view an actual entity has a philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority while a real entity is one which may be actual or may derive its reality from its logical relation to some actual entity or entities for example an occasion in the life of socrates is an actual entity but socrates being a man does not make man an actual entity because it refers indeterminately to many actual entities such as several occasions in the life of socrates and also to several occasions in the lives of alcibiades and of others but the notion of man is real it derives its reality from its reference to those many actual occasions each of which is an actual entity an actual occasion is a concrete entity while terms such as man are abstractions from many concrete relevant entities 91 citation needed 93 according to whitehead an actual entity must earn its philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority by satisfying several philosophical criteria as follows 91 citation needed 93 there is no going behind an actual entity to find something more fundamental in fact or in efficacy this criterion is to be regarded as expressing an axiom or postulated distinguished doctrine an actual entity must be completely determinate in the sense that there may be no confusion about its identity that would allow it to be confounded with another actual entity in this sense an actual entity is completely concrete with no potential to be something other than itself it is what it is it is a source of potentiality for the creation of other actual entities of which it may be said to be a part cause likewise it is the concretion or realization of potentialities of other actual entities which are its partial causes causation between actual entities is essential to their actuality consequently for whitehead each actual entity has its distinct and definite extension in physical minkowski space and so is uniquely identifiable a description in minkowski space supports descriptions in time and space for particular observers it is part of the aim of the philosophy of such an ontology as whitehead s that the actual entities should be all alike qua actual entities they should all satisfy a single definite set of well stated ontological criteria of actuality whitehead proposed that his notion of an occasion of experience satisfies the criteria for its status as the philosophically preferred definition of an actual entity from a purely logical point of view each occasion of experience has in full measure the characters of both objective and subjective reality subjectivity and objectivity refer to different aspects of an occasion of experience and in no way do they exclude each other 91 202 93 examples of other philosophical proposals or candidates as actual entities in this view are aristotle s substances leibniz monads and descartes res verae and the more modern states of affairs aristotle s substances such as socrates have behind them as more fundamental the primary substances and in this sense do not satisfy whitehead s criteria whitehead is not happy with leibniz monads as actual entities because they are windowless and do not cause each other states of affairs are often not closely defined often without specific mention of extension in physical minkowski space they are therefore not necessarily processes of becoming but may be as their name suggests simply static states in some sense states of affairs are contingent on particulars and therefore have something behind them 91 203 93 one summary of the whiteheadian actual entity is that it is a process of becoming another summary referring to its causal linkage to other actual entities is that it is all window in contrast with leibniz windowless monads 91 citation needed 93 this view allows philosophical entities other than actual entities to really exist but not as fundamentally and primarily factual or causally efficacious they have existence as abstractions with reality only derived from their reference to actual entities a whiteheadian actual entity has a unique and completely definite place and time whiteheadian abstractions are not so tightly defined in time and place and in the extreme some are timeless and placeless or eternal entities all abstractions have logical or conceptual rather than efficacious existence their lack of definite time does not make them unreal if they refer to actual entities whitehead calls this the ontological principle 91 citation needed 93 microcosmic ontology edit there is an established and long philosophical history of the concept of atoms as microscopic physical objects they are far too small to be visible to the naked eye it was as recent as the nineteenth century that precise estimates of the sizes of putative physical atoms began to become plausible almost direct empirical observation of atomic effects was due to the theoretical investigation of brownian motion by albert einstein in the very early twentieth century but even then the real existence of atoms was debated by some such debate might be labeled microcosmic ontology here the word microcosm is used to indicate a physical world of small entities such as for example atoms 91 204 93 subatomic particles are usually considered to be much smaller than atoms their real or actual existence may be very difficult to demonstrate empirically 91 205 93 a distinction is sometimes drawn between actual and virtual subatomic particles reasonably one may ask in what sense if any do virtual particles exist as physical entities for atomic and subatomic particles difficult questions arise such as do they possess a precise position or a precise momentum a question that continues to be controversial is to what kind of physical thing if any does the quantum mechanical wave function refer 91 65 93 ontological argument edit main article ontological argument in the western christian tradition in his 1078 work proslogion anselm of canterbury proposed what is known as the ontological argument for the existence of god 91 note 2 93 anselm defined god as that than which nothing greater can be thought and argued that this being must exist in the mind even in the mind of the person who denies the existence of god he suggested that if the greatest possible being exists in the mind it must also exist in reality if it only exists in the mind then an even greater being must be possible one which exists both in the mind and in reality therefore this greatest possible being must exist in reality seventeenth century french philosopher ren descartes deployed a similar argument descartes published several variations of his argument each of which centred on the idea that god s existence is immediately inferable from a clear and distinct idea of a supremely perfect being in the early eighteenth century gottfried leibniz augmented descartes s ideas in an attempt to prove that a supremely perfect being is a coherent concept norman malcolm revived the ontological argument in 1960 when he located a second stronger ontological argument in anselm s work alvin plantinga challenged this argument and proposed an alternative based on modal logic attempts have also been made to validate anselm s proof using an automated theorem prover 91 citation needed 93 more recently kurt g del proposed a formal argument for god s existence other arguments for god s existence have been advanced including those made by islamic philosophers mulla sadra and allama tabatabai 91 citation needed 93 hintikka s locution for existence edit jaakko hintikka puts the view that a useful explication of the notion of existence is
