eclipse in a web based image search engine a search engine is a software system designed to carry out web searches they search the world wide web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query the search results are generally presented in a line of results often referred to as search engine results pages serps when a user enters a query into a search engine the engine scans its index of web pages to find those that are relevant to the user s query the results are then ranked by relevancy and displayed to the user the information may be a mix of links to web pages images videos infographics articles research papers and other types of files some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories unlike web directories and social bookmarking sites which are maintained by human editors search engines also maintain real time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler any internet based content that can t be indexed and searched by a web search engine falls under the category of deep web contents 1 history 1 1 pre 1990s 1 2 1990s birth of search engines 1 3 2000s present post dot com bubble 2 approach 2 1

pre 1990s edit a system for locating published information intended to overcome the ever increasing difficulty of locating information in ever growing centralized indices of scientific work was described in 1945 by vannevar bush who wrote an article in the atlantic monthly titled as we may think 91 1 93 in which he envisioned libraries of research with connected annotations not unlike modern hyperlinks 91 2 93 link analysis would eventually become a crucial component of search engines through algorithms such as hyper search and pagerank 91 3 93 91 4 93 1990s birth of search engines edit the first internet search engines predate the debut of the web in december 1990 whois user search dates back to 1982 91 5 93 and the knowbot information service multi network user search was first implemented in 1989 91 6 93 the first well documented search engine that searched content files namely ftp files was archie which debuted on 10 september 1990 91 7 93 prior to september 1993 the world wide web was entirely indexed by hand there was a list of webservers edited by tim berners lee and hosted on the cern webserver one snapshot of the list in 1992 remains 91 8 93 but as more and more web servers went online the central list could no longer keep up on the ncsa site new servers were announced under the title what s new 91 9 93 the first tool used for searching content as opposed to users on the internet was archie 91 10 93 the name stands for archive without the v 91 11 93 it was created by alan emtage 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 computer science student at mcgill university in montreal quebec canada the program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous ftp file transfer protocol sites creating a searchable database of file names however archie search engine did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually the rise of gopher created in 1991 by mark mccahill at the university of minnesota led to two new search programs veronica and jughead like archie they searched the file names and titles stored in gopher index systems veronica very easy rodent oriented net wide index to computerized archives provided a keyword search of most gopher menu titles in the entire gopher listings jughead jonzy s universal gopher hierarchy excavation and display was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific gopher servers while the name of the search engine archie search engine was not a reference to the archie comic book series veronica and jughead are characters in the series thus referencing their predecessor in the summer of 1993 no search engine existed for the web though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by hand oscar nierstrasz at the university of geneva wrote a series of perl scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format this formed the basis for w3catalog the web s first primitive search engine released on september 2 1993 91 15 93 in june 1993 matthew gray then at mit produced what was probably the first web robot the perl based world wide web wanderer and used it to generate an index called wandex the purpose of the wanderer was to measure the size of the world wide web which it did until late 1995 the web s second search engine aliweb appeared in november 1993 aliweb did not use a web robot but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format jumpstation created in december 1993 91 16 93 by jonathon fletcher used a web robot to find web pages and to build its index and used a web form as the interface to its query program it was thus the first www resource discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine crawling indexing and searching as described below because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered one of the first all text crawler based search engines was webcrawler which came out in 1994 unlike its predecessors it allowed users to search for any word in any webpage which has become the standard for all major search engines since it was also the search engine that was widely known by the public also in 1994 lycos which started at carnegie mellon university was launched and became a major commercial endeavor the first popular search engine on the web was yahoo search 91 17 93 the first product from yahoo founded by jerry yang and david filo in january 1994 was a web directory called yahoo directory in 1995 a search function was added allowing users to search yahoo directory 91 18 93 91 19 93 it became one of the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest but its search function operated on its web directory rather than its full text copies of web pages soon after a number of search engines appeared and vied for popularity these included magellan excite infoseek inktomi northern light and altavista information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword based search in 1996 robin li developed the rankdex site scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking 91 20 93 91 21 93 91 22 93 and received a us patent for the technology 91 23 93 it was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing 91 24 93 predating the very similar algorithm patent filed by google two years later in 1998 91 25 93 larry page referenced li s work in some of his u s patents for pagerank 91 26 93 li later used his rankdex technology for the baidu search engine which was founded by him in china and launched in 2000 in 1996 netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on netscape s web browser there was so much interest that instead netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines for 5 million a year each search engine would be in rotation on the netscape search engine page the five engines were yahoo magellan lycos infoseek and excite 91 27 93 91 28 93 google adopted the idea of selling search terms in 1998 from a small search engine company named goto com this move had a significant effect on the search engine business which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the internet 91 29 93 search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s 91 30 93 several companies entered the market spectacularly receiving record gains during their initial public offerings some have taken down their public search engine and are marketing enterprise only editions such as northern light many search engine companies were caught up in the dot com bubble a speculation driven market boom that peaked in march 2000 2000s present post dot com bubble edit around 2000 google s search engine rose to prominence 91 31 93 the company achieved better results for many searches with an algorithm called pagerank as was explained in the paper anatomy of a search engine written by sergey brin and larry page the later founders of google 91 4 93 this iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and pagerank of other web sites and pages that link there on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others larry page s patent for pagerank cites robin li s earlier rankdex patent as an influence 91 26 93 91 22 93 google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine in contrast many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal in fact the google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as mystery seeker by 2000 yahoo was providing search services based on inktomi s search engine yahoo acquired inktomi in 2002 and overture which owned alltheweb and altavista in 2003 yahoo switched to google s search engine until 2004 when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions microsoft first launched msn search in the fall of 1998 using search results from inktomi in early 1999 the site began to display listings from looksmart blended with results from inktomi for a short time in 1999 msn search used results from altavista instead in 2004 microsoft began a transition to its own search technology powered by its own web crawler called msnbot microsoft s rebranded search engine bing was launched on june 1 2009 on july 29 2009 yahoo and microsoft finalized a deal in which yahoo search would be powered by microsoft bing technology as of 2019 active search engine crawlers include those of google petal sogou baidu bing gigablast mojeek duckduckgo and yandex approach edit main article search engine technology a search engine maintains the following processes in near real time web crawling indexing searching 91 32 93 web search engines get their information by web crawling from site to site the spider checks for the standard filename robots txt addressed to it the robots txt file contains directives for search spiders telling it which pages to crawl and which pages not to crawl after checking for robots txt and either finding it or not the spider sends certain information back to be indexed depending on many factors such as the titles page content javascript cascading style sheets css headings or its metadata in html meta tags after a certain number of pages crawled amount of data indexed or time spent on the website the spider stops crawling and moves on n o web crawler may actually crawl the entire reachable web due to infinite websites spider traps spam and other exigencies of the real web crawlers instead apply a crawl policy to determine when the crawling of a site should be deemed sufficient some websites are crawled exhaustively while others are crawled only partially 91 33 93 indexing means associating words and other definable tokens found on web pages to their domain names and html based fields the associations are made in a public database made available for web search queries a query from a user can be a single word multiple words or a sentence the index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible 91 32 93 some of the techniques for indexing and caching are trade secrets whereas web crawling is a straightforward process of visiting all sites on a systematic basis between visits by the spider the cached version of the page some or all the content needed to render it stored in the search engine working memory is quickly sent to an inquirer if a visit is overdue the search engine can just act as a web proxy instead in this case the page may differ from the search terms indexed 91 32 93 the cached page holds the appearance of the version whose words were previously indexed so a cached version of a page can be useful to the website when the actual page has been lost but this problem is also considered a mild form of linkrot high level architecture of a standard web crawler typically when a user enters a query into a search engine it is a few keywords 91 34 93 the index already has the names of the sites containing the keywords and these are instantly obtained from the index the real processing load is in generating the web pages that are the search results list every page in the entire list must be weighted according to information in the indexes 91 32 93 then the top search result item requires the lookup reconstruction and markup of the snippets showing the context of the keywords matched these are only part of the processing each search results web page requires and further pages next to the top require more of this post processing beyond simple keyword lookups search engines offer their own gui or command driven operators and search parameters to refine the search results these provide the necessary controls for the user engaged in the feedback loop users create by filtering and weighting while refining the search results given the initial pages of the first search results for example from 2007 the google com search engine has allowed one to filter by date by clicking show search tools in the leftmost column of the initial search results page and then selecting the desired date range 91 35 93 it s also possible to weight by date because each page has a modification time most search engines support the use of the boolean operators and or and not to help end users refine the search query boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search the engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered some search engines provide an advanced feature called proximity search which allows users to define the distance between keywords 91 32 93 there is also concept based searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for the usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back while there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase some pages may be more relevant popular or authoritative than others most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the best results first how a search engine decides which pages are the best matches and what order the results should be shown in varies widely from one engine to another 91 32 93 the methods also change over time as internet usage changes and new techniques evolve there are two main types of search engine that have evolved one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively the other is a system that generates an inverted index by analyzing texts it locates this first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work most web search engines are commercial ventures supported by advertising revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to have their listings ranked higher in search results for a fee search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running search related ads alongside the regular search engine results the search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads 91 36 93 local search edit local search is the process that optimizes the efforts of local businesses they focus on change to make sure all searches are consistent it s important because many people determine where they plan to go and what to buy based on their searches 91 37 93 market share edit as of january 160 2022 91 update 93 google is by far the world s most used search engine with a market share of 92 01 and the world s other most used search engines were bing yahoo baidu yandex and duckduckgo 91 38 93 russia and east asia edit in russia yandex has a market share of 61 9 compared to google s 28 3 91 39 93 in china baidu is the most popular search engine 91 40 93 south korea s homegrown search portal naver is used for 70 of online searches in the country 91 41 93 yahoo japan and yahoo taiwan are the most popular avenues for internet searches in japan and taiwan respectively 91 42 93 china is one of few countries where google is not in the top three web search engines for market share google was previously a top search engine in china but withdrew after a disagreement with the government over censorship and a cyberattack 91 43 93 europe edit most countries markets in the european union are dominated by google except for the czech republic where seznam is a strong competitor 91 44 93 the search engine qwant is based in paris france where it attracts most of its 50 million monthly registered users from search engine bias edit although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on some combination of their popularity and relevancy empirical studies indicate various political economic and social biases in the information they provide 91 45 93 91 46 93 and the underlying assumptions about the technology 91 47 93 these biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes e g companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results and political processes e g the removal of search results to comply with local laws 91 48 93 for example google will not surface certain neo nazi websites in france and germany where holocaust denial is illegal biases can also be a result of social processes as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non normative viewpoints in favor of more popular results 91 49 93 indexing algorithms of major search engines skew towards coverage of u s based sites rather than websites from non u s countries 91 46 93 google bombing is one example of an attempt to manipulate search results for political social or commercial reasons several scholars have studied the cultural changes triggered by search engines 91 50 93 and the representation of certain controversial topics in their results such as terrorism in ireland 91 51 93 climate change denial 91 52 93 and conspiracy theories 91 53 93 customized results and filter bubbles edit there has been concern raised that search engines such as google and bing provide customized results based on the user s activity history leading to what has been termed echo chambers or filter bubbles by eli pariser in 2011 91 54 93 the argument is that search engines and social media platforms use algorithms to selectively guess what information a user would like to see based on information about the user such as location past click behaviour and search history as a result websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user s past viewpoint according to eli pariser users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble since this problem has been identified competing search engines have emerged that seek to avoid this problem by not tracking or bubbling users such as duckduckgo however many scholars have questioned pariser s view finding that there is little evidence for the filter bubble 91 55 93 91 56 93 91 57 93 on the contrary a number of studies trying to verify the existence of filter bubbles have found only minor levels of personalisation in search 91 57 93 that most people encounter a range of views when browsing online and that google news tends to promote mainstream established news outlets 91 58 93 91 56 93 religious search engines edit the global growth of the internet and electronic media in the arab and muslim world during the last decade has encouraged islamic adherents in the middle east and asian sub continent to attempt their own search engines their own filtered search portals that would enable users to perform safe searches more than usual safe search filters these islamic web portals categorizing websites into being either halal or haram based on interpretation of the law of islam imhalal came online in september 2011 halalgoogling came online in july 2013 these use haram filters on the collections from google and bing and others 91 59 93 while lack of investment and slow pace in technologies in the muslim world has hindered progress and thwarted success of an islamic search engine targeting as the main consumers islamic adherents projects like muxlim a muslim lifestyle site did receive millions of dollars from investors like rite internet ventures and it also faltered other religion oriented search engines are jewogle the jewish version of google 91 60 93 and seekfind org which is christian seekfind filters sites that attack or degrade their faith 91 61 93 search engine submission edit web search engine submission is a process in which a webmaster submits a website directly to a search engine while search engine submission is sometimes presented as a way to promote a website it generally is not necessary because the major search engines use web crawlers that will eventually find most web sites on the internet without assistance they can either submit one web page at a time or they can submit the entire site using a sitemap but it is normally only necessary to submit the home page of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website there are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it and to have a web site s record updated after a substantial redesign some search engine submission software not only submits websites to multiple search engines but also adds links to websites from their own pages this could appear helpful in increasing a website s ranking because external links are one of the most important factors determining a website s ranking however john mueller of google has stated that this can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site with a negative impact on site ranking 91 62 93 comparison to social bookmarking edit see also social media optimization in comparison to search engines a social bookmarking system has several advantages over traditional automated resource location and classification software such as search engine spiders all tag based classification of internet resources such as web sites is done by human beings who understand the content of the resource as opposed to software which algorithmically attempts to determine the meaning and quality of a resource also people can find and bookmark web pages that have not yet been noticed or indexed by web spiders 91 63 93 additionally a social bookmarking system can rank a resource based on how many times it has been bookmarked by users which may be a more useful metric for end users than systems that rank resources based on the number of external links pointing to it however both types of ranking are vulnerable to fraud see gaming the system and both need technical countermeasures to try to deal with this technology edit this article or section may need to be cleaned up or summarized because it has been split from to search engine technology web search engines archie edit the first web search engines was archie created in 1990 91 64 93 by alan emtage a student at mcgill university in montreal the author originally wanted to call the program archives but had to shorten it to comply with the unix world standard of assigning programs and files short cryptic names such as grep cat troff sed awk perl and so on the primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the file transfer protocol ftp this was and still is a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the internet it works like this some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer he sets up a program on his computer called an ftp server when someone on the internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer he or she connects to it via another program called an ftp client any ftp client program can connect with any ftp server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the ftp protocol initially anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an ftp server in order to make the file available to others later anonymous ftp sites became repositories for files allowing all users to post and retrieve them even with archive sites many important files were still scattered on small ftp servers unfortunately these files could be located only by the internet equivalent of word of mouth somebody would post an e mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file archie changed all that it combined a script based data gatherer which fetched site listings of anonymous ftp files with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query 4 in other words archie s gatherer scoured ftp sites across the internet and indexed all of the files it found its regular expression matcher provided users with access to its database 91 65 93 veronica edit in 1993 the university of nevada system computing services group developed veronica 91 64 93 it was created as a type of searching device similar to archie but for gopher files another gopher search service called jughead appeared a little later probably for the sole purpose of rounding out the comic strip triumvirate jughead is an acronym for jonzy s universal gopher hierarchy excavation and display although like veronica it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym jughead s functionality was pretty much identical to veronica s although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges 91 65 93 the lone wanderer edit the world wide web wanderer developed by matthew gray in 1993 91 66 93 was the first robot on the web and was designed to track the web s growth initially the wanderer counted only web servers but shortly after its introduction it started to capture urls as it went along the database of captured urls became the wandex the first web database matthew gray s wanderer created quite a controversy at the time partially because early versions of the software ran rampant through the net and caused a noticeable netwide performance degradation this degradation occurred because the wanderer would access the same page hundreds of time a day the wanderer soon amended its ways but the controversy over whether robots were good or bad for the internet remained in response to the wanderer martijn koster created archie like indexing of the web or aliweb in october 1993 as the name implies aliweb was the http equivalent of archie and because of this it is still unique in many ways aliweb does not have a web searching robot instead webmasters of participating sites post their own index information for each page they want listed the advantage to this method is that users get to describe their own site and a robot doesn t run about eating up net bandwidth unfortunately the disadvantages of aliweb are more of a problem today the primary disadvantage is that a special indexing file must be submitted most users do not understand how to create such a file and therefore they don t submit their pages this leads to a relatively small database which meant that users are less likely to search aliweb than one of the large bot based sites this catch 22 has been somewhat offset by incorporating other databases into the aliweb search but it still does not have the mass appeal of search engines such as yahoo or lycos 91 65 93 excite edit excite initially called architext was started by six stanford undergraduates in february 1993 their idea was to use statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches through the large amount of information on the internet their project was fully funded by mid 1993 once funding was secured they released a version of their search software for webmasters to use on their own web sites at the time the software was called architext but it now goes by the name of excite for web servers 91 65 93 excite was the first serious commercial search engine which launched in 1995 91 67 93 it was developed in stanford and was purchased for 6 5 billion by home in 2001 excite and home went bankrupt and infospace bought excite for 10 million some of the first analysis of web searching was conducted on search logs from excite 91 68 93 91 69 93 yahoo edit in april 1994 two stanford university ph d candidates david filo and jerry yang created some pages that became rather popular they called the collection of pages yahoo their official explanation for the name choice was that they considered themselves to be a pair of yahoos as the number of links grew and their pages began to receive thousands of hits a day the team created ways to better organize the data in order to aid in data retrieval yahoo www yahoo com became a searchable directory the search feature was a simple database search engine because yahoo entries were entered and categorized manually yahoo was not really classified as a search engine instead it was generally considered to be a searchable directory yahoo has since automated some aspects of the gathering and classification process blurring the distinction between engine and directory the wanderer captured only urls which made it difficult to find things that weren t explicitly described by their url because urls are rather cryptic to begin with this didn t help the average user searching yahoo or the galaxy was much more effective because they contained additional descriptive information about the indexed sites lycos edit at carnegie mellon university during july 1994 michael mauldin on leave from cmu developed the lycos search engine types of web search engines edit search engines on the web are sites enriched with facility to search the content stored on other sites there is difference in the way various search engines work but they all perform three basic tasks 91 70 93 finding and selecting full or partial content based on the keywords provided maintaining index of the content and referencing to the location they find allowing users to look for words or combinations of words found in that index the process begins when a user enters a query statement into the system through the interface provided type example description conventional librarycatalog search by keyword title author etc text based google bing yahoo search by keywords limited search using queries in natural language voice based google bing yahoo search by keywords limited search using queries in natural language multimedia search qbic webseek safe search by visual appearance shapes colors q a stack exchange nsir search in restricted natural language clustering systems vivisimo clusty research systems lemur nutch there are basically three types of search engines those that are powered by robots called crawlers ants or spiders and those that are powered by human submissions and those that are a hybrid of the two crawler based search engines are those that use automated software agents called crawlers that visit a web site read the information on the actual site read the site s meta tags and also follow the links that the site connects to performing indexing on all linked web sites as well the crawler returns all that information back to a central depository where the data is indexed the crawler will periodically return to the sites to check for any information that has changed the frequency with which this happens is determined by the administrators of the search engine human powered search engines rely on humans to submit information that is subsequently indexed and catalogued only information that is submitted is put into the index in both cases when you query a search engine to locate information you re actually searching through the index that the search engine has created you are not actually searching the web these indices are giant databases of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched this explains why sometimes a search on a commercial search engine such as yahoo or google will return results that are in fact dead links since the search results are based on the index if the index hasn t been updated since a web page became invalid the search engine treats the page as still an active link even though it no longer is it will remain that way until the index is updated so why will the same search on different search engines produce different results part of the answer to that question is because not all indices are going to be exactly the same it depends on what the spiders find or what the humans submitted but more important not every search engine uses the same algorithm to search through the indices the algorithm is what the search engines use to determine the relevance of the information in the index to what the user is searching for one of the elements that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a web page those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant but search engine technology is becoming sophisticated in its attempt to discourage what is known as keyword stuffing or spamdexing another common element that algorithms analyze is the way that pages link to other pages in the web by analyzing how pages link to each other an engine can both determine what a page is about if the keywords of the linked pages are similar to the keywords on the original page and whether that page is considered important and deserving of a boost in ranking just as the technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated to ignore keyword stuffing it is also becoming more savvy to web masters who build artificial links into their sites in order to build an artificial ranking modern
