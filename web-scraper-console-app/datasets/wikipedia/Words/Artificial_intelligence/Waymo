laid the groundwork for the google s self driving car program 91 20 93 pribot edit in february 2008 a discovery channel producer for the documentary series prototype this called levandowski 91 14 93 91 21 93 the producer requested to borrow levandowski s ghost rider the autonomous two wheeled motocycle levandowski s berkeley team had built for the 2004 darpa grand challenge 91 22 93 however in 2007 levandowski had donated the self driving bike to the smithsonian 91 23 93 since the motorcycle was not available levandowski offered to retrofit a toyota prius as a self driving pizza delivery car for the show 91 14 93 as a google employee levandowski asked larry page and sebastian thrun if google was interested in participating in the show both declined citing liability issues 91 22 93 however they authorized levandowski to move forward with building the car given it was clear that it was not associated with google 91 14 93 91 24 93 within weeks levandowski founded anthony s robots so that he and his team could modify a toyota prius without reference to google 91 13 93 he retrofitted the car with light detection and ranging technology lidar sensors cameras and software from his

some of these incidents were not reported by google when simulations indicated the car would have stopped on its own there is some controversy concerning this distinction between driver initiated disengagements that google reports and those that it does not report 91 136 93 limitations edit waymo operates in some of its testing markets such as chandler arizona at level 4 autonomy with no one sitting behind the steering wheel sharing roadways with other drivers and pedestrians 91 44 93 91 109 93 however more testing is needed waymo s earlier testing has focused on areas without harsh weather extreme density or complicated road systems but it has moved on to test under new conditions 91 71 93 91 103 93 as a result waymo has begun testing in areas with harsher conditions such as its winter testing in michigan 91 68 93 in 2014 a critic wrote in the mit technology review that unmapped stop lights would cause problems with waymo s technology and the self driving technology could not detect potholes additionally the lidar technology cannot spot some potholes or discern when humans such as a police officers signal the car to stop the critic wrote 91 137 93 waymo has worked to improve how its technology responds in construction zones 91 138 93 91 139 93 commercialization edit in 2012 brin stated that google self driving cars would be available for the general public in 2017
