illustration from gray s anatomy 1918 of a lateral view of the human brain featuring the hippocampus among other neuroanatomical features the earliest study of the nervous system dates to ancient egypt trepanation the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull for the purpose of curing head injuries or mental disorders or relieving cranial pressure was first recorded during the neolithic period manuscripts dating to 1700 160 bc indicate that the egyptians had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage 91 10 93 early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a cranial stuffing of sorts in egypt from the late middle kingdom onwards the brain was regularly removed in preparation for mummification it was believed at the time that the heart was the seat of intelligence according to herodotus the first step of mummification was to take a crooked piece of iron and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils thus getting rid of a portion while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs 91 11 93 the view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the greek physician hippocrates he believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation since most specialized organs e g 160 eyes ears tongue are located in the head near the brain but was also the seat of intelligence 91 12 93 plato also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul 91 13 93 aristotle however believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart 91 14 93 this view was generally accepted until the roman physician galen a follower of hippocrates and physician to roman gladiators observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains 91 15 93 abulcasis averroes avicenna avenzoar and maimonides active in the medieval muslim world described a number of medical problems related to the brain in renaissance europe vesalius 1514 1564 ren descartes 1596 1650 thomas willis 1621 1675 and jan swammerdam 1637 1680 also made several contributions to neuroscience the golgi stain first allowed for the visualization of individual neurons luigi galvani s pioneering work in the late 1700s set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons in the first half of the 19th century jean pierre flourens pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in living animals describing their effects on motricity sensibility and behavior in 1843 emil du bois reymond demonstrated the electrical nature of the nerve signal 91 16 93 whose speed hermann von helmholtz proceeded to measure 91 17 93 and in 1875 richard caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys 91 18 93 adolf beck published in 1890 similar observations of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs 91 19 93 studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by camillo golgi during the late 1890s the procedure used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual neurons his technique was used by santiago ram n y cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron 91 20 93 golgi and ram n y cajal shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain in parallel with this research work with brain damaged patients by paul broca suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions at the time broca s findings were seen as a confirmation of franz joseph gall s theory that language was localized and that certain psychological functions were localized in specific areas of the cerebral cortex 91 21 93 91 22 93 the localization of function hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by john hughlings jackson who correctly inferred the organization of the motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body carl wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production modern research through neuroimaging techniques still uses the brodmann cerebral cytoarchitectonic map referring to study of cell structure anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks 91 23 93 during the 20th century neuroscience began to be recognized as a distinct academic discipline in its own right rather than as studies of the nervous system within other disciplines eric kandel and collaborators have cited david rioch francis o schmitt and stephen kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field 91 24 93 rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the walter reed army institute of research starting in the 1950s during the same period schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the biology department at the massachusetts institute of technology bringing together biology chemistry physics and mathematics the first freestanding neuroscience department then called psychobiology was founded in 1964 at the university of california irvine by james l mcgaugh 91 25 93 this was followed by the department of neurobiology at harvard medical school which was founded in 1966 by stephen kuffler 91 26 93 the understanding of neurons and of nervous system function became increasingly precise and molecular during the 20th century for example in 1952 alan lloyd hodgkin and andrew huxley presented a mathematical model for transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid which they called action potentials and how they are initiated and propagated known as the hodgkin huxley model in 1961 1962 richard fitzhugh and j nagumo simplified hodgkin huxley in what is called the fitzhugh nagumo model in 1962 bernard katz modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as synapses beginning in 1966 eric kandel and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage in aplysia in 1981 catherine morris and harold lecar combined these models in the morris lecar model such increasingly quantitative work gave rise to numerous biological neuron models and models of neural computation as a result of the increasing interest about the nervous system several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists during the 20th century for example the international brain research organization was founded in 1961 91 27 93 the international society for neurochemistry in 1963 91 28 93 the european brain and behaviour society in 1968 91 29 93 and the society for neuroscience in 1969 91 30 93 recently the application of neuroscience research results has also given rise to applied disciplines as neuroeconomics 91 31 93 neuroeducation 91 32 93 neuroethics 91 33 93 and neurolaw 91 34 93 over time brain research has gone through philosophical experimental and theoretical phases with work on neural implants and brain simulation predicted to be important in the future 91 35 93 modern neuroscience edit main article outline of neuroscience human nervous system the scientific study of the nervous system increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century principally due to advances in molecular biology electrophysiology and computational neuroscience this has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects how it is structured how it works how it develops how it malfunctions and how it can be changed for example it has become possible to understand in much detail the complex processes occurring within a single neuron neurons are cells specialized for communication they are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals influencing the activity of other neurons muscles or glands at their termination points a nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other the vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts the central nervous system defined as the brain and spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system in many species including all vertebrates the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body with most of the complexity residing in the brain the human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled at least one out of three of the approximately 20 000 genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain 91 36 93 due to the high degree of plasticity of the human brain the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life 91 37 93 making sense of the nervous system s dynamic complexity is a formidable research challenge ultimately neuroscientists would like to understand every aspect of the nervous system including how it works how it develops how it malfunctions and how it can be altered or repaired analysis of the nervous system is therefore performed at multiple levels ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels the specific topics that form the main focus of research change over time driven by an ever expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress developments in electron microscopy computer science electronics functional neuroimaging and genetics and genomics have all been major drivers of progress perhaps one of the main unsolved problems in modern neuroscience is the so called cell types problem which refers to the categorization definition and identification of all neuronal astrocytic cell types in an organism usually this refers to the mouse brain since an understanding of the mouse brain is seen as a stepping stone to understand the human 91 38 93 modern advances in the classification of neuronal cells have been enabled by electrophysiological recording single cell genetic sequencing and high quality microscopy which have been recently combined into a single method pipeline called patch seq in which all 3 methods are simultaneously applied using miniature tools 91 39 93 the efficiency of this method and the large amounts of data that is generated allowed researchers to make some general conclusions about cell types for example that the human and mouse brain have different versions of fundamentally the same cell types 91 40 93 molecular and cellular neuroscience edit main articles molecular neuroscience and cellular neurosciencethis section does not cite any

photograph of a stained neuron in a chicken embryo basic questions addressed in molecular neuroscience include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how axons form complex connectivity patterns at this level tools from molecular biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions 91 41 93 the morphology molecular identity and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include the mechanisms of how neurons process signals physiologically and electrochemically these questions include how signals are processed by neurites and somas and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron neurites are thin extensions from a neuronal cell body consisting of dendrites specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons and axons specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials somas are the cell bodies of the neurons and contain the nucleus another major area of cellular neuroscience is the investigation of the development of the nervous system questions include the patterning and regionalization of the nervous system axonal and dendritic development trophic

adapted from shebani et al 2013 questions in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as reflexes multisensory integration motor coordination circadian rhythms emotional responses learning and memory in other words they address how these neural circuits function in large scale brain networks and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated for example systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities how does vision work how do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound how does the somatosensory system process tactile information the related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems respectively despite many advancements the way that networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood cognitive and behavioral neuroscience edit main articles behavioral neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry the emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging e g fmri pet spect eeg meg electrophysiology optogenetics and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena recent research shows that there is an interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research soliciting and integrating both perspectives for example neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy psychology and psychopathology 91 45 93 moreover the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past supporting a view of memory as a generative constructive and dynamic process 91 46 93 neuroscience is also allied with the social and behavioral sciences as well as with nascent interdisciplinary fields examples of such alliances include neuroeconomics decision theory social neuroscience and neuromarketing to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment a study into consumer responses for example uses eeg to investigate neural correlates associated with narrative transportation into stories about energy efficiency 91 47 93 computational neuroscience edit main article computational neuroscience questions in computational neuroscience can span a wide range of levels of traditional analysis such as development structure and cognitive functions of the brain research in this field utilizes mathematical models theoretical analysis and computer simulation to describe and verify biologically plausible neurons and nervous systems for example biological neuron models are mathematical descriptions of spiking neurons which can be used to describe both the behavior of single neurons as well as the dynamics of neural networks computational neuroscience is often referred to as theoretical neuroscience nanoparticles in medicine are versatile in treating neurological disorders showing promising results in mediating drug transport across the blood brain barrier 91 48 93 implementing nanoparticles in antiepileptic drugs enhances their medical efficacy by increasing bioavailability in the bloodstream as well as offering a measure of control in release time concentration 91 48 93 although nanoparticles can assist therapeutic drugs by adjusting physical properties to achieve desirable effects inadvertent increases in toxicity often occur in preliminary drug trials 91 49 93 furthermore production of nanomedicine for drug trials is economically consuming hindering progress in their implementation computational models in nanoneuroscience provide alternatives to study the efficacy of nanotechnology based medicines in neurological disorders while mitigating potential side effects and development costs 91 48 93 nanomaterials often operate at length scales between classical and quantum regimes 91 50 93 due to the associated uncertainties at the length scales that nanomaterials operate it is difficult to predict their behavior prior to in vivo studies 91 48 93 classically the physical processes which occur throughout neurons are analogous to electrical circuits designers focus on such analogies and model brain activity as a neural circuit 91 51 93 success in computational modeling of neurons have led to the development of stereochemical models that accurately predict acetylcholine receptor based synapses operating at microsecond time scales 91 51 93 ultrafine nanoneedles for cellular manipulations are thinner than the smallest single walled carbon nanotubes computational quantum chemistry 91 52 93 is used to design ultrafine nanomaterials with highly symmetrical structures to optimize geometry reactivity and stability 91 50 93 behavior of nanomaterials are dominated by long ranged non bonding interactions 91 53 93 electrochemical processes that occur throughout the brain generate an electric field which can inadvertently affect the behavior of some nanomaterials 91 50 93 molecular dynamics simulations can mitigate the development phase of nanomaterials as well as prevent neural toxicity of nanomaterials following in vivo clinical trials 91 49 93 testing nanomaterials using molecular dynamics optimizes nano characteristics for therapeutic purposes by testing different environment conditions nanomaterial shape fabrications nanomaterial surface properties etc without the need for in vivo experimentation 91 54 93 flexibility in molecular dynamic simulations allows medical practitioners to personalize treatment nanoparticle related data from translational nanoinformatics links
