problem takeover ethics existential risk turing test history timeline progress ai winter technology applications projects programming languages glossary glossary vte in the history of artificial intelligence an ai winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research 91 1 93 the term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter 91 2 93 the field has experienced several hype cycles followed by disappointment and criticism followed by funding cuts followed by renewed interest years or even decades later the term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of aaai then called the american association of artificial intelligence it is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the ai community followed by pessimism in the press followed by a severe cutback in funding followed by the end of serious research 91 2 93 at the meeting roger schank and marvin minsky two leading ai researchers who had survived the winter of the 1970s warned the business community that enthusiasm for ai had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow three years later the billion dollar ai industry began to collapse 91 2 93 hype is common in many emerging technologies such as the railway mania or the dot com bubble the ai winter was a result of such hype due to over inflated promises by developers unnaturally high expectations from end users and extensive promotion in the media 91 3 93 despite the rise and fall of ai s reputation it has continued to develop new and successful technologies ai researcher rodney brooks would complain in 2002 that there s this stupid myth out there that ai has failed but ai is around you every second of the day 91 4 93 in 2005 ray kurzweil agreed many observers still think that the ai winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the ai field yet today many thousands of ai applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry 91 5 93 enthusiasm and optimism about ai has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s beginning about 2012 interest in artificial intelligence and especially the sub field of machine learning from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment quantum winter is the prospect of a similar

overview edit there were two major winters in 1974 1980 and 1987 1993 91 6 93 and several smaller episodes including the following 1966 failure of machine translation 1970 abandonment of connectionism period of overlapping trends 1971 75 darpa s frustration with the speech understanding research program at carnegie mellon university 1973 large decrease in ai research in the united kingdom in response to the lighthill report 1973 74 darpa s cutbacks to academic ai research in general 1987 collapse of the lisp machine market 1988 cancellation of new spending on ai by the strategic computing initiative 1993 resistance to new expert systems deployment and maintenance 1990s end of the fifth generation computer project s original goals early episodes edit machine translation and the alpac report of 1966 edit see also history of machine translation during the cold war the us government was particularly interested in the automatic instant translation of russian documents and scientific reports the government aggressively supported efforts at machine translation starting in 1954 at the outset the researchers were optimistic noam chomsky s new work in grammar was streamlining the translation process and there were many predictions of imminent breakthroughs 91 7 93 briefing for us vice president gerald ford in 1973 on the junction grammar based computer translation model however researchers had underestimated the profound difficulty of word sense disambiguation in order to translate a sentence a machine needed to have some idea what the sentence was about otherwise it made mistakes an apocryphal 91 8 93 example is the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak translated back and forth with russian it became the vodka is good but the meat is rotten 91 9 93 later researchers would call this the commonsense knowledge problem by 1964 the national research council had become concerned about the lack of progress and formed the automatic language processing advisory committee alpac to look into the problem they concluded in a famous 1966 report that machine translation was more expensive less accurate and slower than human translation after spending some 20 million dollars the nrc ended all support careers were destroyed and research ended 91 2 93 91 7 93 machine translation is still an open research problem in the 21st century which has met with some success google translate yahoo babel fish the abandonment of connectionism in 1969 edit see also perceptrons and frank rosenblatt some of the earliest work in ai used networks or circuits of connected units to simulate intelligent behavior examples of this kind of work called connectionism include walter pitts and warren mcculloch s first description of a neural network for logic and marvin minsky s work on the snarc system in the late 1950s most of these approaches were abandoned when researchers began to explore symbolic reasoning as the essence of intelligence following the success of programs like the logic theorist and the general problem solver 91 10 93 however one type of connectionist work continued the study of perceptrons invented by frank rosenblatt who kept the field alive with his salesmanship and the sheer force of his personality 91 11 93 he optimistically predicted that the perceptron may eventually be able to learn make decisions and translate languages 91 12 93 mainstream research into perceptrons came to an abrupt end in 1969 when marvin minsky and seymour papert published the book perceptrons which was perceived as outlining the limits of what perceptrons could do connectionist approaches were abandoned for the next decade or so while important work such as paul werbos discovery of backpropagation continued in a limited way major funding for connectionist projects was difficult to find in the 1970s and early 1980s 91 13 93 the winter of connectionist research came to an end in the middle 1980s when the work of john hopfield david rumelhart and others revived large scale interest in neural networks 91 14 93 rosenblatt did not live to see this however as he died in a boating accident shortly after perceptrons was published 91 12 93 the setbacks of 1974 edit the lighthill report edit see also lighthill report in 1973 professor sir james lighthill was asked by the uk parliament to evaluate the state of ai research in the united kingdom his report now called the lighthill report criticized the utter failure of ai to achieve its grandiose objectives he concluded that nothing being done in ai could not be done in other sciences he specifically mentioned the problem of combinatorial explosion or intractability which implied that many of ai s most successful algorithms would grind to a halt on real world problems and were only suitable for solving toy versions 91 15 93 the report was contested in a debate broadcast in the bbc controversy series in 1973 the debate the general purpose robot is a mirage from the royal institution was lighthill versus the team of donald michie john mccarthy and richard gregory 91 16 93 mccarthy later wrote that the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in ai from the beginning 91 17 93 the report led to the complete dismantling of ai research in england 91 15 93 ai research continued in only a few universities edinburgh essex and sussex research would not revive on a large scale until 1983 when alvey a research project of the british government began to fund ai again from a war chest of 350 million in response to the japanese fifth generation project see below alvey had a number of uk only requirements which did not sit well internationally especially with us partners and lost phase 2 funding darpa s early 1970s funding cuts edit during the 1960s the defense advanced research projects agency then known as arpa now known as darpa provided millions of dollars for ai research with few strings attached j c r licklider the founding director of darpa s computing division believed in funding people not projects 91 18 93 and he and several successors allowed ai s leaders such as marvin minsky john mccarthy herbert a simon or allen newell to spend it almost any way they liked this attitude changed after the passage of mansfield amendment in 1969 which required darpa to fund mission oriented direct research rather than basic undirected research 91 19 93 pure undirected research of the kind that had gone on in the 1960s would no longer be funded by darpa researchers now had to show that their work would soon produce some useful military technology ai research proposals were held to a very high standard the situation was not helped when the lighthill report and darpa s own study the american study group suggested that most ai research was unlikely to produce anything truly useful in the foreseeable future darpa s money was directed at specific projects with identifiable goals such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems by 1974 funding for ai projects was hard to find 91 19 93 ai researcher hans moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration their initial promises to darpa had been much too optimistic of course what they delivered stopped considerably short of that but they felt they couldn t in their next proposal promise less than in the first one so they promised more 91 20 93 the result moravec claims is that some of the staff at darpa had lost patience with ai research it was literally phrased at darpa that some of these people were going to be taught a lesson 91 by 93 having their two million dollar a year contracts cut to almost nothing moravec told daniel crevier 91 21 93 while the autonomous tank project was a failure the battle management system the dynamic analysis and replanning tool proved to be enormously successful saving billions in the first gulf war repaying all of darpas investment in ai 91 22 93 and justifying darpa s pragmatic policy 91 23 93 the sur debacle edit darpa was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the speech understanding research program at carnegie mellon university darpa had hoped for and felt it had been promised a system that could respond to voice commands from a pilot the sur team had developed a system which could recognize spoken english but only if the words were spoken in a particular order darpa felt it had been duped and in 1974 they cancelled a three million dollar a year contract 91 24 93 many years later several successful commercial speech recognition systems would use the technology developed by the carnegie mellon team such as hidden markov models and the market for speech recognition systems would reach 4 billion by 2001 91 25 93 the setbacks of the late 1980s and early 1990s edit the collapse of the lisp machine market edit in the 1980s a form of ai program called an expert system was adopted by corporations around the world the first commercial expert system was xcon developed at carnegie mellon for digital equipment corporation and it was an enormous success it was estimated to have saved the company 40 million dollars over just six years of operation corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on ai most of it to in house ai departments an industry grew up to support them including software companies like teknowledge and intellicorp kee and hardware companies like symbolics and lisp machines inc who built specialized computers called lisp machines that were optimized to process the programming language lisp the preferred language for ai 91 26 93 91 27 93 in 1987 three years after minsky and schank s prediction the market for specialized lisp based ai hardware collapsed workstations by companies like sun microsystems offered a powerful alternative to lisp machines and companies like lucid offered a lisp environment for this new class of workstations the performance of these general workstations became an increasingly difficult challenge for lisp machines companies like lucid and franz lisp offered increasingly powerful versions of lisp that were portable to all unix systems for example benchmarks were published showing workstations maintaining a performance advantage over lisp machines 91 28 93 later desktop computers built by apple and ibm would also offer a simpler and more popular architecture to run lisp applications on by 1987 some of them had become as powerful as the more expensive lisp machines the desktop computers had rule based engines such as clips available 91 29 93 these alternatives left consumers with no reason to buy an expensive machine specialized for running lisp an entire industry worth half a billion dollars was replaced in a single year 91 30 93 by the early 1990s most commercial lisp companies had failed including symbolics lisp machines inc lucid inc etc other companies like texas instruments and xerox abandoned the field a small number of customer companies that is companies using systems written in lisp and developed on lisp machine platforms continued to maintain systems in some cases this maintenance involved the assumption of the resulting support work 91 3 93 slowdown in deployment of expert systems edit by the early 1990s the earliest successful expert systems such as xcon proved too expensive to maintain they were difficult to update they could not learn they were brittle i e they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs and they fell prey to problems such as the qualification problem that had been identified years earlier in research in nonmonotonic logic expert systems proved useful but only in a few special contexts 91 31 93 91 32 93 another problem dealt with the computational hardness of truth maintenance efforts for general knowledge kee used an assumption based approach see nasa texsys supporting multiple world scenarios that was difficult to understand and apply the few remaining expert system shell companies were eventually forced to downsize and search for new markets and software paradigms like case based reasoning or universal database access the maturation of common lisp saved many systems such as icad which found application in knowledge based engineering other systems such as intellicorp s kee moved from lisp to a c variant on the pc and helped establish object oriented technology including providing major support for the development of uml see uml partners the end of the fifth generation project edit see also fifth generation computer in 1981 the japanese ministry of international trade and industry set aside 850 million for the fifth generation computer project their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations translate languages interpret pictures and reason like human beings by 1991 the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 had not been met according to hp newquist in the brain makers on june 1 1992 the fifth generation project ended not with a successful roar but with a whimper 91 3 93 as with other ai projects expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible 91 33 93 91 34 93 strategic computing initiative cutbacks edit see also strategic computing initiative in 1983 in response to the fifth generation project darpa again began to fund ai research through the strategic computing initiative as originally proposed the project would begin with practical achievable goals which even included artificial general intelligence as long term objective the program was under the direction of the information processing technology office ipto and was also directed at supercomputing and microelectronics by 1985 it had spent 100 million and 92 projects were underway at 60 institutions half in industry half in universities and government labs ai research was generously funded by the sci 91 35 93 jack schwarz who ascended to the leadership of ipto in 1987 dismissed expert systems as clever programming and cut funding to ai deeply and brutally eviscerating sci schwarz felt that darpa should focus its funding only on those technologies which showed the most promise in his words darpa should surf rather than dog paddle and he felt strongly ai was not the next wave insiders in the program cited problems in communication organization and integration a few projects survived the funding cuts including pilot s assistant and an autonomous land vehicle which were never delivered and the dart battle management system which as noted above was successful 91 36 93 developments post ai winter edit this section needs to be updated please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information september 2015 a survey of reports from the early 2000s suggests that ai s reputation was still less than stellar alex castro quoted in the economist 7 june 2007 investors were put off by the term voice recognition which like artificial intelligence is associated with systems that have all too often failed to live up to their promises 91 37 93 patty tascarella in pittsburgh business times 2006 some believe the word robotics actually carries a stigma that hurts a company s chances at funding 91 38 93 john markoff in the new york times 2005 at its low point some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild eyed dreamers 91 39 93 many researchers in ai in the mid 2000s deliberately called their work by other names such as informatics machine learning analytics knowledge based systems business rules management cognitive systems intelligent systems intelligent agents or computational intelligence to indicate that their work emphasizes particular tools or is directed at a particular sub problem although this may be partly because they consider their field to be fundamentally different from ai it is also true that the new names help to procure funding by avoiding the stigma of false promises attached to the name artificial intelligence 91 39 93 91 40 93 ai integration edit in the late 1990s and early 21st century ai technology became widely used as elements of larger systems 91 41 93 91 5 93 but the field is rarely credited for these successes in 2006 nick bostrom explained that a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled ai anymore 91 42 93 rodney brooks stated around the same time that there s this stupid myth out there that ai has failed but ai is around you every second of the day 91 4 93 technologies developed by ai researchers have achieved commercial success in a number of domains such as machine translation data mining industrial robotics logistics 91 43 93 speech recognition 91 44 93 banking software 91 45 93 medical diagnosis 91 45 93 and google s search engine 91 46 93 fuzzy logic controllers have been developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles the 2006 audi tt vw touareg 91 47 93 and vw caravelle feature the dsp transmission which utilizes fuzzy logic a number of koda variants koda fabia also currently include a fuzzy logic based controller camera sensors widely utilize fuzzy logic to enable focus heuristic search and data analytics are both technologies that have developed from the evolutionary computing and machine learning subdivision of the ai research community again these techniques have been applied to a wide range of real world problems with considerable commercial success data analytics technology utilizing algorithms for the automated formation of classifiers that were developed in the supervised machine learning community in the 1990s for example tdidt support vector machines neural nets ibl are now 91 when 93 used pervasively by companies for marketing survey targeting and discovery of trends and features in data sets ai funding edit researchers and economists frequently judged the status of an ai winter by reviewing which ai projects were being funded how much and by whom trends in funding are often set by major funding agencies in the developed world currently darpa and a civilian funding program called eu fp7 provide much of the funding for ai research in the us and european union as of 2007 darpa was soliciting ai research proposals under a number of programs including the grand challenge program cognitive technology threat warning system ct2ws human assisted neural devices sn07 43 autonomous real time ground ubiquitous surveillance imaging system argus is and urban reasoning and geospatial exploitation technology urgent perhaps best known is darpa s grand challenge program 91 48 93 which has developed fully automated road vehicles that can successfully navigate real world terrain 91 49 93 in a fully autonomous fashion darpa has also supported programs on the semantic web with a great deal of emphasis on intelligent management of content and automated understanding however james hendler the manager of the darpa program at the time expressed some disappointment with the government s ability to create rapid change and moved to working with the world wide web consortium to transition the technologies to the private sector the eu fp7 funding program provides financial support to researchers within the european union in 2007 2008 it was funding ai research under the cognitive systems interaction and robotics programme 193m the digital libraries and content programme 203m and the fet programme 185m 91 50 93 current ai spring edit a marked increase in ai funding development deployment and commercial use has led to the idea of the ai winter being long over 91 51 93 concerns are occasionally raised that a new ai winter could be triggered by overly ambitious or unrealistic promises by prominent ai scientists or overpromising on the part of commercial vendors the successes of the current ai spring are advances in language translation in particular google translate image recognition spurred by the imagenet training database as commercialized by google image search and in game playing systems such as alphazero chess champion and alphago go champion and watson jeopardy champion most of these advances have occurred since 2010 underlying causes behind ai winters edit this section possibly contains original research please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations statements consisting only of original research should be removed march 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message several explanations have been put forth for the cause of ai winters in general as ai progressed from government funded applications to commercial ones new dynamics came into play while hype is the most commonly cited cause the explanations are not necessarily mutually exclusive hype edit the ai winters can 91 citation needed 93 be partly understood as a sequence of over inflated expectations and subsequent crash seen in stock markets and exemplified 91 citation needed 93 by the railway mania and dotcom bubble in a common pattern in the development of new technology known as hype cycle an event typically a technological breakthrough creates publicity which feeds on itself to create a peak of inflated expectations followed by a trough of disillusionment since scientific and technological progress cannot keep pace with the publicity fueled increase in expectations among investors and other stakeholders a crash must follow ai technology seems to be no exception to this rule 91 citation needed 93 for example in the 1960s the realization that computers could simulate 1 layer neural networks led to a neural network hype cycle that lasted until the 1969 publication of the book perceptrons which severely limited the set of problems that could be optimally solved by 1 layer networks in 1985 the realization that neural networks could be used to solve optimization problems as a result of famous papers by hopfield and tank 91 52 93 91 53 93 together with the threat of japan s fifth generation project led to renewed interest and application institutional factors edit another factor is ai s place in the organisation of universities research on ai often takes the form of interdisciplinary research ai is therefore prone to the same problems other types of interdisciplinary research face funding is channeled through the established departments and during budget cuts there will be a tendency to shield the core contents of each department at the expense of interdisciplinary and less traditional research projects economic factors edit downturns in a country s national economy cause budget cuts in universities the core contents tendency worsens the effect on ai research and investors in the market are likely to put their money into less risky ventures during a crisis together this may amplify an economic downturn into an ai winter it is worth noting that the lighthill report came at a time of economic crisis in the uk 91 54 93 when universities had to make cuts and the question was only which programs should go insufficient computing capability edit early in the computing history the potential for neural networks was understood but it has never been realized fairly simple networks require significant computing capacity even by today s standards empty pipeline edit it is common to see the relationship between basic research and technology as a pipeline advances in basic research give birth to advances in applied research which in turn leads to new commercial applications from this it is often argued that a lack of basic research will lead to a drop in marketable technology some years down the line this view was advanced by james hendler in 2008 91 29 93 when he claimed that the fall of expert systems in the late 80s was not due to an inherent and unavoidable brittleness of expert systems but to funding cuts in basic research in the 1970s these expert systems advanced in the 1980s through applied research and product development but by the end of the decade the pipeline had run dry and expert systems were unable to produce improvements that could have overcome this brittleness and secured further funding failure to adapt edit the fall of the lisp machine market and the failure of the fifth generation computers were cases of expensive advanced products being overtaken by simpler and cheaper alternatives this fits the definition of a low end disruptive technology with the lisp machine makers being marginalized expert systems were carried over to the new desktop computers by for instance clips so the fall of the lisp machine market and the fall of expert systems are strictly speaking two separate events still the failure to adapt to such a change in the outside computing milieu is cited as one reason for the 1980s ai winter 91 29 93 arguments and debates on past and future of ai edit several philosophers cognitive scientists and computer scientists have speculated on where ai might have failed and what lies in its future hubert dreyfus highlighted flawed assumptions of ai research in the past and as early as 1966 correctly predicted that the first wave of ai research would fail to fulfill the very public promises it was making other critics like noam chomsky have argued that ai is headed in the wrong direction in part because of its heavy reliance on statistical techniques 91 55 93 chomsky s comments fit into a larger debate with peter norvig centered around the role of statistical methods in ai the exchange between the two started with comments made by chomsky at a symposium at mit 91 56 93 to which norvig wrote a response 91 57 93 see also edit ai effect history of artificial intelligence software crisis notes edit ai expert
