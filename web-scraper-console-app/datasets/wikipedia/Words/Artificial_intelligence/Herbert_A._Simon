science whose work also influenced the fields of computer science economics and cognitive psychology his primary research interest was decision making within organizations and he is best known for the theories of bounded rationality and satisficing 91 5 93 91 6 93 he received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in 1978 and the turing award in computer science in 1975 91 7 93 91 8 93 his research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science computer science public administration management and political science 91 9 93 he was at carnegie mellon university for most of his career from 1949 to 2001 91 10 93 where he helped found the carnegie mellon school of computer science one of the first such departments in the world notably simon was among the pioneers of several modern day scientific domains such as artificial intelligence information processing decision making problem solving organization theory and complex systems he was among the earliest to analyze the architecture of complexity and to propose a preferential attachment mechanism to explain power law distributions 91 11 93 91 12 93 contents 1 early life and

1916 simon s father arthur simon 1881 1948 was a jewish 91 13 93 electrical engineer who came to the united states from germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree at technische hochschule darmstadt 91 14 93 an inventor arthur also was an independent patent attorney 91 15 93 simon s mother edna marguerite merkel 1888 1969 was an accomplished pianist whose jewish lutheran and catholic ancestors came from prague and cologne 91 16 93 simon s european ancestors were piano makers goldsmiths and vintners simon attended milwaukee public schools where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist while attending middle school simon wrote a letter to the editor of the milwaukee journal defending the civil liberties of atheists 91 17 93 unlike most children simon s family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically his mother s younger brother harold merkel 1892 1922 who studied economics at the university of wisconsin madison under john r commons became one of his earliest influences through harold s books on economics and psychology simon discovered social science among his earliest influences simon cited norman angell for his book the great illusion and henry george for his book progress and poverty while attending high school simon joined the debate team where he argued from conviction rather than cussedness in favor of george s single tax 91 18 93 in 1933 simon entered the university of chicago and following his early influences decided to study social science and mathematics simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his color blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory 91 19 93 at an early age simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world while in college simon focused on political science and economics simon s most important mentor was henry schultz an econometrician and mathematical economist 91 2 93 simon received both his b a 1936 and his ph d 1943 in political science from the university of chicago where he studied under harold lasswell nicolas rashevsky rudolf carnap henry schultz and charles edward merriam 91 20 93 after enrolling in a course on measuring municipal governments simon became a research assistant for clarence ridley and the two co authored measuring municipal activities a survey of suggested criteria for appraising administration in 1938 91 21 93 simon s studies led him to the field of organizational decision making which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation career edit after receiving his undergraduate degree simon obtained a research assistantship in municipal administration that turned into the directorship of an operations research group at the university of california berkeley where he worked from 1939 to 1942 by arrangement with the university of chicago during his years at berkeley he took his doctoral exams by mail and worked on his dissertation after hours from 1942 to 1949 simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at illinois institute of technology in chicago there he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the cowles commission who at that time included trygve haavelmo jacob marschak and tjalling koopmans he thus began an in depth study of economics in the area of institutionalism marschak brought simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with sam schurr of the prospective economic effects of atomic energy 91 22 93 simon left in a chess match against allen newell c 8201 1958 from 1949 to 2001 simon was a faculty member at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania in 1949 simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the department of industrial management at carnegie institute of technology carnegie tech which in 1967 became carnegie mellon university simon later also 91 23 93 taught psychology and computer science in the same university 91 22 93 occasionally visiting other universities 91 24 93 research edit seeking to replace the highly simplified classical approach to economic modeling simon became best known for his theory of corporate decision in his book administrative behavior in this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making his organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman but he also played a big part in the creation of the economic cooperation administration in 1948 administrative team that administered aid to the marshall plan for the u s government serving on president lyndon johnson s science advisory committee and also the national academy of sciences 91 22 93 simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications because of this his work can be found in a number of economic literary works making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem human rationality behavioral study of firms theory of casual ordering and the analysis of the parameter identification problem in econometrics 91 25 93 decision making edit main article administrative behavior simon s three stages in rational decision making intelligence design choice idc administrative behavior 91 26 93 first published in 1947 and updated across the years was based on simon s doctoral dissertation 91 27 93 it served as the foundation for his life s work the centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational decisions by his definition an operational administrative decision should be correct efficient and practical to implement with a set of coordinated means 91 27 93 simon recognized that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology he states if there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren it would consist of the single precept always select that alternative among those available which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals 91 27 93 p xxviii contrary to the homo economicus model simon argued that alternatives and consequences may be partly known and means and ends imperfectly differentiated incompletely related or poorly detailed 91 27 93 simon defined the task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by adequacy of achieving the desired objective efficiency with which the result was obtained the task of choice was divided into three required steps 91 28 93 identifying and listing all the alternatives determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences any given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic cases 91 26 93 simon attempted to determine the techniques and or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making 91 27 93 simon writes the human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties these procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences 91 29 93 therefore simon describes work in terms of an economic framework conditioned on human cognitive limitations economic man and administrative man administrative behavior addresses a wide range of human behaviors cognitive abilities management techniques personnel policies training goals and procedures specialized roles criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency and all of the ramifications of communication processes simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions both directly and indirectly 91 26 93 simon argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained 91 26 93 36 49 simon followed chester barnard who stated the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions 91 30 93 personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her extra organizational private life as a member of an organization however that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent purpose and effect organizational inducements rewards and sanctions are all designed to form strengthen and maintain this identification 91 26 93 212 simon 91 27 93 saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals authority addressed in chapter vii the role of authority and in loyalties and identification addressed in chapter x loyalties and organizational identification authority is a well studied primary mark of organizational behavior straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank the actions attitudes and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form style and content but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status and willingness to obey from the subordinate 91 citation needed 93 loyalty was defined by simon as the process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives service objectives or conservation objectives for his own aims as the value indices which determine his organizational decisions 91 31 93 this entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for oneself or one s family 91 32 93 decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values information about facts especially empirically proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values following lasswell 91 33 93 he states that a person identifies himself with a group when in making a decision he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group 91 34 93 simon has been critical of traditional economics elementary understanding of decision making and argues it is too quick to build an idealistic unrealistic picture of the decision making process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture 91 35 93 herbert simon rediscovered path diagrams which were originally invented by sewall wright around 1920 91 36 93 artificial intelligence edit simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence creating with allen newell the logic theory machine 1956 and the general problem solver gps 1957 programs gps may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems both programs were developed using the information processing language ipl 1956 developed by newell cliff shaw and simon donald knuth mentions the development of list processing in ipl with the linked list originally called nss memory for its inventors 91 37 93 in 1957 simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within ten years when in reality that transition took about forty years 91 38 93 in the early 1960s psychologist ulric neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating cold cognition behaviors such as reasoning planning perceiving and deciding they would never be able to replicate hot cognition behaviors such as pain pleasure desire and other emotions simon responded to neisser s views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition 91 39 93 which he updated in 1967 and published in psychological review 91 40 93 simon s work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years but subsequent work on emotions by sloman and picard helped refocus attention on simon s paper and eventually made it highly influential on the topic 91 citation needed 93 simon also collaborated with james g march on several works in organization theory 91 9 93 with allen newell simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules 91 41 93 the study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and with anders ericsson simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis 91 42 93 simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise he said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50 000 chunks of information a chess expert was said to have learned about 50 000 chunks or chess position patterns 91 43 93 he was awarded the acm turing award along with allen newell in 1975 in joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years initially in collaboration with j c cliff shaw at the rand corporation and subsequentially 32 91 sic 93 with numerous faculty and student colleagues at carnegie mellon university they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence the psychology of human cognition and list processing 91 8 93 psychology edit simon was interested in how humans learn and with edward feigenbaum he developed the epam elementary perceiver and memorizer theory one of the first theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program epam was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning 91 44 93 later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise with fernand gobet he has expanded the epam theory into the chrest computational model 91 45 93 the theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata which are more complex structures chrest has been used predominantly to simulate aspects of chess expertise 91 46 93 sociology and economics edit simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in microeconomics he is responsible for the concept of organizational decision making as it is known today he was the first to rigorously examine how administrators made decisions when they did not have perfect and complete information it was in this area that he was awarded the nobel prize in 1978 91 47 93 at the cowles commission simon s main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics his main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics he was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the 1930s the popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit maximization cost minimization in running organizations the argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished in part because of the lack of complete information in decision making simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present these factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision thus they possess only bounded rationality and must make decisions by satisficing or choosing that which might not be optimal but which will make them happy enough bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics it is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory further simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a procedural definition of rationality whereas economists employ a substantive definition gustavos barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality 91 48 93 however in an earlier article bhargava 1997 noted the importance of simon s arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the procedural definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health in particular economists should employ auxiliary assumptions that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes simon was also known for his research on industrial organization 91 49 93 he determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof did not conform to the neoclassical theories of rational decision making simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life mainly focusing on the issue of decision making within the behavior of what he termed bounded rationality rational behavior in economics means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face e g their budget constraint limited choices in pursuit of their self interest this is reflected in the theory of subjective expected utility the term bounded rationality is used to designate rational choice that takes into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics it is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decisions theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory 91 this quote needs a citation 93 simon determined that the best way to study these areas was through computer simulations as such he developed an interest in computer science simon s main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence human computer interaction principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems the use of computers to study by modeling philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of epistemology and the social implications of computer technology 91 50 93 in his youth simon took an interest in land economics and georgism an idea known at the time as single tax 91 18 93 the system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use in 1979 simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on wages 91 51 93 some of simon s economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular 91 50 93 pedagogy edit simon s work has strongly influenced john mighton developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students 91 52 93 mighton cites a 2000 paper by simon and two coauthors that counters arguments by french mathematics educator guy brousseau and others suggesting that excessive practice hampers children s understanding 91 52 93 the criticism of practice called drill and kill as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation is prominent in constructivist writings nothing flies more in the face of the last 20 years of research than the assertion that practice is bad all evidence from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice in denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence the instructional task is not to kill motivation by demanding drill but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest 8201

underwent surgery at upmc presbyterian to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen although the surgery was successful simon later succumbed to the complications that followed they had three children katherine peter and barbara his wife died a year later in 2002 91 1 93 from 1950 to 1955 simon studied mathematical economics and during this time together with david hawkins discovered and proved the hawkins simon theorem on the conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for input output matrices he also developed theorems on near decomposability and aggregation having begun to apply these theorems to organizations by 1954 simon determined that the best way to study problem solving was to simulate it with computer programs which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition founded during the 1950s he was among the first members of the society for general systems research 91 citation needed 93 simon was a pianist and had a keen interest in the arts he was
