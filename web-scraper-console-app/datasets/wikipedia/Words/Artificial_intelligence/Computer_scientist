computer scientist from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search scientist specializing in computer science not to be confused with computational scientist a computer scientist is a person who is trained in the academic study of computer science 91 1 93 computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computation as opposed to the hardware side on which computer engineers mainly focus although there is overlap although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas such as algorithm and data structure development and design software engineering information theory database theory computational complexity theory numerical analysis programming language theory computer graphics and computer vision their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive 91 2 93 a primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models often mathematical to describe the properties of computational systems processors programs computers interacting with people computers interacting with other computers etc with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits faster smaller cheaper more precise etc contents 1 education 1 1 areas of specialization 2 employment 3 see also 4 references education edit most computer scientists are required to possess a phd m s or b s in computer science or other similar fields like information and computer science cis or a closely related discipline such as mathematics 91 2 93 or physics 91 3 93 areas of specialization edit theoretical computer science including data structures and algorithms theory of computation information theory and coding theory programming language theory and formal methods computer systems including computer architecture and computer engineering computer performance analysis concurrency and distributed computing computer networks computer security and cryptography and databases computer applications including computer graphics and visualization human computer interaction scientific computing and artificial intelligence software engineering the application of engineering to software development in a systematic method employment edit computer scientists are often hired by software publishing firms scientific research and development organizations where they develop the theories that allow new technologies to be developed computer scientists are also employed by educational institutions such as universities computer scientists can follow more practical applications of their knowledge doing things such as software engineering they can also be found in the field of information technology consulting and may be seen as a type of mathematician given how much of the field depends on mathematics 91 4 93 computer scientists employed in industry may eventually advance into managerial or project leadership positions 91 5 93 employment prospects for computer scientists are said to be excellent such prospects seem to be attributed in part to very rapid growth in computer systems design and related services industry and the software publishing industry which are projected to be among the fastest growing industries in the u s economy 91 2 93 see also edit computational scientist software engineering list of computer scientists list of computing people list of pioneers in computer science references edit orsucci franco f sala nicoletta 2008 reflexing interfaces the complex coevolution of information technology ecosystems information science reference p 160 335 isbn 160 978 1599046273 a b c computer and information research scientists u s bureau of labor statistics 29 march 2012 retrieved 9 september 2019 fields of employment for physics bachelors in the private sector tuty of 2010 amp 2012 combined american physical society retrieved 9 september 2019 computing disciplines amp majors pdf retrieved 9 september 2019 perry benjamin beau what is a computer scientist the university of newcastle authority control national libraries france data germany 2 israel united states czech republic 2 3 4 retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title computer scientist amp oldid 1125561949 categories computer scientistscomputer occupationshidden categories articles with short descriptionshort description is different from wikidatause british english from june 2012use dmy dates from may 2022articles with bnf identifiersarticles with gnd identifiersarticles with j9u identifiersarticles with lccn identifiersarticles with nkc identifiers
