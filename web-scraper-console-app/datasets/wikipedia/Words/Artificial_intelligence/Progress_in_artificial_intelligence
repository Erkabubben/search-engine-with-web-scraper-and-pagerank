human on a particular task artificial intelligence applications have been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis stock trading robot control law scientific discovery video games and toys however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled ai anymore 91 1 93 91 2 93 many thousands of ai applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry 91 3 93 in the late 1990s and early 21st century ai technology became widely used as elements of larger systems 91 3 93 91 4 93 but the field was rarely credited for these successes at the time kaplan and haenlein structure artificial intelligence along three evolutionary stages 1 artificial narrow intelligence applying ai only to specific tasks 2 artificial general intelligence applying ai to several areas and able to autonomously solve problems they were never even designed for and 3 artificial super intelligence applying ai to any area capable of scientific creativity social skills and general wisdom 91 2 93 to allow comparison with human performance artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well defined problems such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests also smaller problems

comparative success of artificial intelligence in different areas ai like electricity or the steam engine is a general purpose technology there is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks ai tends to excel at 91 14 93 some versions of moravec s paradox observe that humans are more likely to outperform machines in areas such as physical dexterity that have been the direct target of natural selection 91 15 93 while projects such as alphazero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch many other machine learning projects require large training datasets 91 16 93 91 17 93 researcher andrew ng has suggested as a highly imperfect rule of thumb that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought we can probably now or in the near future automate using ai 91 18 93 games provide a high profile benchmark for assessing rates of progress many games have a large professional player base and a well established competitive rating system alphago brought the era of classical board game benchmarks to a close when artificial intelligence proved their competitive edge over humans in 2016 deep mind s alphago ai software program defeated the world s best professional go player lee sedol 91 19 93 games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to ai in the area of game theory the most prominent milestone in this area was brought to

videogames 91 22 93 91 23 93 broad classes of outcome for an ai test may be given as optimal it is not possible to perform better note some of these entries were solved by humans super human performs
