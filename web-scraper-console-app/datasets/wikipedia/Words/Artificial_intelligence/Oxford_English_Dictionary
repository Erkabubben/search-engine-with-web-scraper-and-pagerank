work began on the dictionary in 1857 but it was only in 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project under the name of a new english dictionary on historical principles founded mainly on the materials collected by the philological society in 1895 the title the oxford english dictionary was first used unofficially on the covers of the series and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in 10 bound volumes in 1933 the title the oxford english dictionary fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as 12 volumes with a one volume supplement more supplements came over the years until 1989 when the second edition was published comprising 21 728 pages in 20 volumes 91 1 93 since 2000 compilation of a third edition of

whether current or obsolete is presented first and each additional sense is presented in historical order according to the date of its earliest ascertainable recorded use 91 5 93 following each definition are several brief illustrating quotations presented in chronological order from the earliest ascertainable use of the word in that sense to the last ascertainable use for an obsolete sense to indicate both its life span and the time since its desuetude or to a relatively recent use for current ones the format of the oed 39 s entries has influenced numerous other historical lexicography projects the forerunners to the oed such as the early volumes of the deutsches w rterbuch had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources whereas the oed editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications this influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works 91 6 93 entries and relative size edit diagram of the types of english vocabulary included in the oed devised by james murray its first editor according to the publishers it would take a single person 120 years to key in the 59 million words of the oed second edition 60 years to proofread them and 540 megabytes to store them electronically 91 7 93 as of 30 november 2005 the oxford english dictionary contained approximately 301 100 main entries supplementing the entry headwords there are 157 000 bold type combinations and derivatives 91 8 93 169 000 italicized bold phrases and combinations 91 9 93 616 500 word forms in total including 137 000 pronunciations 249 300 etymologies 577 000 cross references and 2 412 400 usage quotations the dictionary s latest complete print edition second edition 1989 was printed in 20 volumes comprising 291 500 entries in 21 730 pages the longest entry in the oed2 was for the verb set which required 60 000 words to describe some 580 senses 430 for the bare verb the rest in phrasal verbs and idioms as entries began to be revised for the oed3 in sequence starting from m the record was progressively broken by the verbs make in 2000 then put in 2007 then run in 2011 with 645 senses 91 10 93 91 11 93 91 12 93 despite its considerable size the oed is neither the world s largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language another earlier large dictionary is the grimm brothers dictionary of the german language begun in 1838 and completed in 1961 the first edition of the vocabolario degli accademici della crusca is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern

group of intellectuals in london and unconnected to oxford university 91 16 93 58 8202 103 104 8202 112 8202 richard chenevix trench herbert coleridge and frederick furnivall who were dissatisfied with the existing english dictionaries the society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844 91 17 93 but it was not until june 1857 that they began by forming an unregistered words committee to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries in november trench s report was not a list of unregistered words instead it was the study on some deficiencies in our english dictionaries which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries 91 18 93 incomplete coverage of obsolete words inconsistent coverage of families of related words incorrect dates for earliest use of words history of obsolete senses of words often omitted inadequate distinction among synonyms insufficient use of good illustrative quotations space wasted on inappropriate or redundant content the society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the english dictionaries of the 19th century and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in english dictionaries to a larger project trench suggested that a new truly comprehensive dictionary was needed on 7 january 1858 the society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary 91 16 93 58 8202 107 108 8202 volunteer readers would be assigned particular books copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips later the same year the society agreed to the project in principle with the title a new english dictionary on historical principles ned 91 19 93 58 8202 ix x 8202 early editors edit see also list of contributors to the oxford english dictionary richard chenevix trench 1807 1886 played the key role in the project s first months but his appointment as dean of westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required he withdrew and herbert coleridge became the first editor 91 20 93 58 8202 8 9 8202 frederick furnivall 1825 1910 on 12 may 1860 coleridge s dictionary plan was published and research was started his house was the first editorial office he arrayed 100 000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon hole grid 91 20 93 58 8202 9 8202 in april 1861 the group published the first sample pages later that month coleridge died of tuberculosis aged 30 91 19 93 58 8202 x 8202 thereupon furnivall became editor he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable but temperamentally ill suited for the work 91 16 93 58 8202 110 8202 many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project as furnivall failed to keep them motivated furthermore many of the slips were misplaced furnivall believed that since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed as a result he founded the early english text society in 1864 and the chaucer society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts 91 19 93 58 8202 xii 8202 furnivall s preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public as well as crucial sources for lexicographers but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations while enthusiastic the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections ultimately furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor 91 21 93 in the 1870s furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both henry sweet and henry nicol to succeed him he then approached james murray who accepted the post of editor in the late 1870s furnivall and murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary in 1878 oxford university press agreed with murray to proceed with the massive project the agreement was formalized the following year 91 16 93 58 8202 111 112 8202 20 years after its conception the dictionary project finally had a publisher it would take another 50 years to complete william chester minor 1834 1920 late in his editorship murray learned that one especially prolific reader w c minor was confined to a mental hospital for in modern terminology schizophrenia 91 16 93 58 8202 xiii 8202 minor was a yale university trained surgeon and a military officer in the american civil war who had been confined to broadmoor asylum for the criminally insane after killing a man in london he invented his own quotation tracking system allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors requests the story of how murray and minor worked together to advance the oed was retold in the 1998 book the surgeon of crowthorne us title the professor and the madman 91 16 93 which was the basis for a 2019 film the professor and the madman starring mel gibson and sean penn oxford editors edit james murray in the scriptorium at banbury road during the 1870s the philological society was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope 91 1 93 they had pages printed by publishers but no publication agreement was reached both the cambridge university press and the oxford university press were approached the oup finally agreed in 1879 after two years of negotiating by sweet furnivall and murray to publish the dictionary and to pay murray who was both the editor and the philological society president the dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles with the final form in four volumes totalling 6 400 pages they hoped to finish the project in ten years 91 20 93 58 8202 1 8202 a quotation slip as used in the compilation of the oed illustrating the word flood murray started the project working in a corrugated iron outbuilding called the scriptorium which was lined with wooden planks bookshelves and 1 029 pigeon holes for the quotation slips 91 19 93 58 8202 xiii 8202 he tracked and regathered furnivall s collection of quotation slips which were found to concentrate on rare interesting words rather than common usages for instance there were ten times as many quotations for abusion as for abuse 91 22 93 he appealed through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries for readers who would report as many quotations as you can for ordinary words and for words that were rare obsolete old fashioned new peculiar or used in a peculiar way 91 22 93 murray had american philologist and liberal arts college professor francis march manage the collection in north america 1 000 quotation slips arrived daily to the scriptorium and by 1880 there were 2 500 000 91 20 93 58 8202 15 8202 the first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 february 1884 twenty three years after coleridge s sample pages the full title was a new english dictionary on historical principles founded mainly on the materials collected by the philological society the 352 page volume words from a to ant cost 12s 6d 91 20 93 58 8202 251 8202 equivalent to 69 32 in 2021 the total sales were only 4 000 copies 91 23 93 58 8202 169 8202 the oup saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements accordingly new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on murray 91 20 93 58 8202 32 33 8202 the first was that he move from mill hill to oxford which he did in 1885 murray had his scriptorium re erected on his new property 91 19 93 58 8202 xvii 8202 the 78 banbury road oxford house erstwhile residence of james murray editor of the oxford english dictionary murray resisted the second demand that if he could not meet schedule he must hire a second senior editor to work in parallel to him outside his supervision on words from elsewhere in the alphabet murray did not want to share the work feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience that turned out not to be so and philip gell of the oup forced the promotion of murray s assistant henry bradley hired by murray in 1884 who worked independently in the british museum in london beginning in 1888 in 1896 bradley moved to oxford university 91 20 93 gell continued harassing murray and bradley with his business concerns containing costs and speeding production to the point where the project s collapse seemed likely newspapers reported the harassment particularly the saturday review and public opinion backed the editors 91 23 93 58 8202 182 83 8202 gell was fired and the university reversed his cost policies if the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger it would it was an important work and worth the time and money to properly finish neither murray nor bradley lived to see it murray died in 1915 having been responsible for words starting with a d h k o p and t nearly half the finished dictionary bradley died in 1923 having completed e g l m s sh st and w we by then two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work continuing without much trouble william craigie started in 1901 and was responsible for n q r si sq u v and wo wy 91 19 93 58 8202 xix 8202 the oup had previously thought london too far from oxford but after 1925 craigie worked on the dictionary in chicago where he was a professor 91 19 93 58 8202 xix 8202 91 20 93 the fourth editor was charles talbut onions who compiled the remaining ranges starting in 1914 su sz wh wo and x z 91 24 93 in 1919 1920 j r r tolkien was employed by the oed researching etymologies of the waggle to warlock range 91 25 93 later he parodied the principal editors as the four wise clerks of oxenford in the story farmer giles of ham 91 26 93 by early 1894 a total of 11 fascicles had been published or about one per year four for a b five for c and two for e 91 19 93 of these eight were 352 pages long while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break which eventually became a volume break at this point it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages priced at 2s 6d if enough material was ready 128 or even 192 pages would be published together this pace was maintained until world war i forced reductions in staff 91 19 93 58 8202 xx 8202 each time enough consecutive pages were available the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles 91 19 93 58 8202 xx 8202 also in 1895 the title oxford english dictionary was first used it then appeared only on the outer covers of the fascicles the original title was still the official one and was used everywhere else 91 19 93 58 8202 xx 8202 completion of first edition and first supplement edit the 125th and last fascicle covered words from wise to the end of w and was published on 19 april 1928 and the full dictionary in bound volumes followed immediately 91 19 93 58 8202 xx 8202 william shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the completed dictionary with hamlet his most quoted work george eliot mary ann evans is the most quoted female writer collectively the bible is the most quoted work in many translations the most quoted single work is cursor mundi 91 7 93 additional material for a given letter range continued to be gathered after the corresponding fascicle was printed with a view towards inclusion in a supplement or revised edition a one volume supplement of such material was published in 1933 with entries weighted towards the start of the alphabet where the fascicles were decades old 91 19 93 the supplement included at least one word bondmaid accidentally omitted when its slips were misplaced 91 27 93 many words and senses newly coined famously appendicitis coined in 1886 and missing from the 1885 fascicle which came to prominence when edward vii s 1902 appendicitis postponed his coronation 91 28 93 and some previously excluded as too obscure notoriously radium omitted in 1903 months before its discoverers pierre and marie curie won the nobel prize in physics 91 29 93 also in 1933 the original fascicles of the entire dictionary were re issued bound into 12 volumes under the title the oxford english dictionary 91 30 93 this edition of 13 volumes including the supplement was subsequently reprinted in 1961 and 1970 second supplement edit in 1933 oxford had finally put the dictionary to rest all work ended and the quotation slips went into storage however the english language continued to change and by the time 20 years had passed the dictionary was outdated 91 31 93 there were three possible ways to update it the cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places the most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re edited and retypeset with each change included in its proper alphabetical place but this would have been the most expensive option with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced the oup chose a middle approach combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement robert burchfield was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement 91 32 93 charles talbut onions turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions as well the work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years 91 31 93 it actually took 29 years by which time the new supplement oeds had grown to four volumes starting with a h o and sea they were published in 1972 1976 1982 and 1986 respectively bringing the complete dictionary to 16 volumes or 17 counting the first supplement burchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern day language and through the supplement the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology as well as popular culture and colloquial speech burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in english speaking regions beyond the united kingdom including north america australia new zealand south africa india pakistan and the caribbean burchfield also removed for unknown reasons many entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement 91 33 93 in 2012 an analysis by lexicographer sarah ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords despite burchfield s claim that he included more such words the proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17 of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of english some of these had only a single recorded usage but many had multiple recorded citations and it ran against what was thought to be the established oed editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to world english 91 34 93 91 35 93 91 36 93 revised american edition edit this was published in 1968 at 300 there were changes in the arrangement of the volumes for example volume 7 covered only n poy the remaining p entries being transferred to volume 8 91 citation needed 93 second edition

would need to be computerized achieving this would require retyping it once but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text preparation for this process began in 1983 and editorial work started the following year under the administrative direction of timothy j benbow with john a simpson and edmund s c weiner as co editors 91 37 93 in 2016 simpson published his memoir chronicling his years at the oed the word detective searching for the meaning of it all at the oxford english dictionary a memoir new york basic books editing an entry of the noed using lexx a printout of the sgml markup used in the computerization of the oed showing pencil annotations used to mark corrections thus began the new oxford english dictionary noed project in the united states more than 120 typists of the international computaprint corporation now reed tech started keying in over 350 000 000 characters their work checked by 55 proof readers in england 91 37 93 retyping the text alone was not sufficient all the information represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained which was done by marking up the content in sgml 91 37 93 a specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it under a 1985 agreement some of this software work was done at the university of waterloo canada at the centre for the new oxford english dictionary led by frank tompa and gaston gonnet this search technology went on to become the basis for the open text corporation 91 38 93 computer hardware database and other software development managers and programmers for the project were donated by the british subsidiary of ibm the colour syntax directed editor for the project lexx 91 39 93 was written by mike cowlishaw of ibm 91 40 93 the university of waterloo in canada volunteered to design the database a walton litz an english professor at princeton university who served on the oxford university press advisory council was quoted in time as saying i ve never been associated with a project i ve never even heard of a project that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline 91 41 93 by 1989 the noed project had achieved its primary goals and the editors working online had successfully combined the original text burchfield s supplement and a small amount of newer material into a single unified dictionary the word new was again dropped from the name and the second edition of the oed or the oed2 was published the first edition retronymically became the oed1 the oxford english dictionary 2 was printed in 20 volumes 91 1 93 up to a very late stage all the volumes of the first edition were started on letter boundaries for the second edition there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries and they were made roughly equal in size the 20 volumes started with a b b c cham creel dvandva follow hat interval look moul ow poise quemadero rob ser soot su thru unemancipated and wave the content of the oed2 is mostly just a reorganization of the earlier corpus but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long needed format changes the headword of each entry was no longer capitalized allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter 91 42 93 murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation there being no standard available at the time whereas the oed2 adopted the modern international phonetic alphabet 91 42 93 91 43 93 unlike the earlier edition all foreign alphabets except greek were transliterated 91 42 93 the british quiz show countdown awarded the leather bound complete version to the champions of each series between its inception in 1982 and series 63 in 2010 91 44 93 the prize was axed after series 83 completed in june 2021 due to being considered out of date 91 45 93 when the print version of the second edition was published in 1989 the response was enthusiastic author anthony burgess declared it the greatest publishing event of the century as quoted by the los angeles times 91 46 93 time dubbed the book a scholarly everest 91 41 93 and richard boston writing for the guardian called it one of the wonders of the world 91 47 93 additions series edit the supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the oed as a whole but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary yet many definitions contained disproven scientific theories outdated historical information and moral values that were no longer widely accepted 91 48 93 91 49 93 furthermore the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition s publication meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use 91 50 93 accordingly it was recognized that work on a third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems 91 48 93 the first attempt to produce a new edition came with the oxford english dictionary additions series a new set of supplements to complement the oed2 with the intention of producing a third edition from them 91 51 93 the previous supplements appeared in alphabetical instalments whereas the new series had a full a z range of entries within each individual volume with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry 91 51 93 however in the end only three additions volumes were published this way two in 1993 and one in 1997 91 52 93 91 53 93 91 54 93 each containing about 3 000 new definitions 91 7 93 the possibilities of the world wide web and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved new text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with and with publication on the web as a possibility the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before 91 55 93 a new approach was called for and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new complete revision of the dictionary oxford english dictionary additions series volume 1 isbn 160 978 0 19 861292 6 includes over 20 000 illustrative quotations showing the evolution of each word or meaning th impression 1994

2000 the editors of the dictionary began a major revision project to create a completely revised third edition of the dictionary oed3 expected to be completed in 2037 91 56 93 91 57 93 91 58 93 at a projected cost of about 34 million 91 59 93 91 1 93 revisions were started at the letter m with new material appearing every three months on the oed online website the editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even since the later entries in the oed1 generally tended to be better than the earlier ones however in march 2008 the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating key english words from across the alphabet along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them 91 60 93 with the relaunch of the oed online website in december 2010 alphabetical revision was abandoned altogether 91 61 93 the revision is expected roughly to double the dictionary in size 91 4 93 91 62 93 apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language the third edition brings many other improvements including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions for easier reading and computerized searching more etymological information and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole 91 55 93 91 63 93 while the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels plays and poetry with additional material from newspapers and academic journals the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions such as wills inventories account books diaries journals and letters 91 62 93 john simpson was the first chief editor of the oed3 he retired in 2013 and was replaced by michael proffitt who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary 91 64 93 the production of the new edition exploits computer technology particularly since the inauguration in june 2005 of the perfect all singing all dancing editorial and notation application or pasadena with this xml based system lexicographers can spend less effort on presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions this system has also simplified the use of the quotations database and enabled staff in new york to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their oxford based counterparts 91 65 93 other important computer uses include internet

impression 2009 11 16 relationship to other oxford dictionaries edit the oed 39 s utility and renown as a historical dictionary have led to numerous offspring projects and other dictionaries bearing the oxford name though not all are directly related to the oed itself the shorter oxford english dictionary originally started in 1902 and completed in 1933 91 81 93 is an abridgement of the full work that retains the historical focus but does not include any words which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by shakespeare milton spenser and the king james bible 91 82 93 a completely new edition was produced from the oed2 and published in 1993 91 83 93 with revisions in 2002 and 2007 the concise oxford dictionary is a different work which aims to cover current english only without the historical focus the original edition mostly based on the oed1 was edited by francis george fowler and henry watson fowler and published in 1911 before the main work was completed 91 84 93 revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in english usage the pocket oxford dictionary of current english was originally conceived by f g fowler and h w fowler to be compressed compact and concise its primary source is the oxford english dictionary and it is nominally an abridgement of the concise oxford dictionary it was first published in 1924 91 85 93 in 1998 the new oxford dictionary of english node was published while also aiming to cover current english node was not based on the oed instead it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of corpus linguistics 91 86 93 once node was published a similarly brand new edition of the concise oxford dictionary followed this time based on an abridgement of node rather than the oed node under the new title of the oxford dictionary of english or ode continues to be principal source for oxford s product line of current english dictionaries including the new oxford american dictionary with the oed now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries spelling edit main article oxford spelling the oed lists british headword spellings e g labour centre with variants following labor center etc for the suffix more commonly spelt ise in british english oup policy dictates a preference for the spelling ize e g realize vs realise and globalization vs globalisation the rationale is etymological in that the english suffix is mainly derived from the greek suffix izein or the latin iz re 91 87 93 however ze is also sometimes treated as an americanism insofar as the ze suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong as with analyse british english which is spelt analyze in american english 91 88 93 91 89 93 reception and criticism edit british prime minister stanley baldwin described the oed as a national treasure 91 90 93 author anu garg founder of wordsmith org has called it a lex icon 91 91 93 tim bray co creator of extensible markup language xml credits the oed as the developing inspiration of that markup language 91 92 93 however despite its claims of authority 91 93 93 the dictionary has been criticized since the 1960s because of its scope its claims to authority its british centredness and relative neglect of world englishes 91 94 93 its implied but unacknowledged focus on literary language and above all its influence the oed as a commercial product has always had to steer a line between scholarship and marketing in his review of the 1982 supplement 91 95 93 university of oxford linguist roy harris writes that criticizing the oed is extremely difficult because one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution one that has become like the english monarchy virtually immune from criticism in principle he further notes that neologisms from respected literary authors such as samuel beckett and virginia woolf are included whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less respectable sources holds less sway even though they may be commonly used he writes that the oed 39 s b lack and white lexicography is also black and white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage faulting the dictionary s prescriptive rather than descriptive usage to harris this prescriptive classification of certain usages as erroneous and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the social bias es of the presumably well educated and wealthy compilers however the identification of erroneous and catachrestic usages is being removed from third edition entries 91 96 93 sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications 91 97 93 another avenue of criticism is the dictionary s non inclusion of etymologies for words of aave or african language origin such as jazz dig or badmouth the latter two are possibly of wolof and mandinka languages respectively 91 98 93 91 99 93 as of 2022 oup is preparing a specialized oxford dictionary of african american english in collaboration with harvard university s hutchins center for african and african american research with literary critic henry louis gates jr being the project s editor in chief 91 100 93 91 101 93 harris also faults the editors donnish conservatism and their adherence to prudish victorian morals citing as an example the non inclusion of various centuries old four letter words until 1972 however no english dictionary included such words for fear of possible prosecution under british obscenity laws until after the conclusion of the lady chatterley s lover obscenity trial in 1960 the penguin english dictionary of 1965 was the first dictionary that included the word fuck 91 102 93 joseph wright s english dialect dictionary had included shit in 1905 91 103 93 the oed 39 s claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as pius ten hacken who notes that the dictionary actively strives toward definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes 91 104 93 founding editor james murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms despite their documentation unless he felt that they were widely enough used in 1902 he declined to add the word radium to the dictionary 91 105 93 see also edit australian oxford dictionary canadian oxford dictionary compact oxford english dictionary of current english concise oxford english dictionary new oxford
