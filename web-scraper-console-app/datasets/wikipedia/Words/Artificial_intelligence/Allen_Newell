lairdfrank rittermilind tambe allen newell march 19 1927 8211 july 19 1992 was a researcher in computer science and cognitive psychology at the rand corporation and at carnegie mellon university s school of computer science tepper school of business and department of psychology he contributed to the information processing language 1956 and two of the earliest ai programs the logic theory machine 1956 and the general problem solver 1957 with herbert a simon he was awarded the acm s a m turing award along with herbert a simon in 1975 for their basic contributions to artificial intelligence and the psychology of human cognition 91 1 93 91 2 93 contents 1 early studies 2 artificial intelligence 3 later achievements 4 awards and honors 5 see also 6 references 6 1 further reading 7 external links early studies edit newell completed his bachelor s degree in physics from stanford in 1949 he was a graduate student at princeton university from 1949 1950 where he did mathematics due to his early exposure to an unknown field known as game theory and the experiences from the study of mathematics he was convinced that he would prefer a combination of experimental and theoretical research to pure mathematics in 1950 he left princeton and joined the rand corporation in santa monica where he worked for a group that was studying logistics problems of the air force simon his work with joseph kruskal led to the creation of two theories a model for organization theory and formulating precise concepts in organization theory newell eventually earned his phd from the now tepper school of business at carnegie mellon with herbert simon serving as his advisor afterwards newell turned to the design and conduct of laboratory experiments on decision making in small groups simon he was dissatisfied however with the accuracy and validity of their findings produced from small scale laboratory experiments he joined with fellow rand teammates john kennedy bob chapman and bill biel at an air force early warning station to study organizational processes in flight crews they received funding from the air force in 1952 to build a simulator that would enable them to examine and analyze the interactions in the cockpit related to decision making and information handling from these studies newell came to believe that information processing is the central activity in organizations artificial intelligence edit in september 1954 newell enrolled in a seminar where oliver selfridge described a running computer program that learned to recognize letters and other patterns simon this was when allen came to believe that systems may be created and contain intelligence and have the ability to adapt with this in mind allen after a couple of months wrote in 1955 the chess machine an example of dealing with a complex task by adaptation which outlined an imaginative design for a computer program to play chess in humanoid fashion simon his work came to the attention of economist and future nobel laureate herbert a simon and together with programmer j c shaw they developed the first true artificial intelligence program 91 according to whom 93 the logic theorist newell s work on the program laid the foundations of the field his inventions included list processing the most important programming paradigm used by ai ever since the application of means ends analysis to general reasoning or reasoning as search and the use of heuristics to limit the search space they presented the program at the dartmouth conference of 1956 an informal gathering of researchers who were interested in simulating intelligence with machines the conference now widely considered the birth of artificial intelligence 91 3 93 was enormously influential and those who attended became the leaders of ai research for the next two decades newell included later achievements edit newell and simon formed a lasting partnership they founded an artificial intelligence laboratory at carnegie mellon university and produced a series of important programs and theoretical insights throughout the late fifties and sixties this work included the general problem solver a highly influential implementation of means ends analysis and the physical symbol systems hypothesis the controversial philosophical assertion that all intelligent behavior could be reduced to the kind of symbol manipulation that newell s programs demonstrated newell s work culminated in the development of a cognitive architecture known as soar and his unified theory of cognition published in 1990 but their improvement was the objective of his efforts up to his death one of the last newell s letters the field of cognitive architectures that he initiated is still active in both the artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science communities 91 4 93 awards and honors edit 1971 john danz lecturer university of washington 1971 harry goode memorial award american federation of
