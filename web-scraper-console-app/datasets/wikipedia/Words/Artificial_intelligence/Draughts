has dark pieces usually black the other has light pieces usually white or red players alternate turns a player cannot move an opponent s pieces a move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square if the adjacent square contains an opponent s piece and the square immediately beyond it is vacant the piece may be captured and removed from the game by jumping over it only the dark squares of the checkerboard are used a piece can only move diagonally into an unoccupied square when capturing an opponent s piece is possible capturing is mandatory in most official rules if the player does not capture the other player can remove the opponent s piece as a penalty or muffin and where there are two or more such positions the player forfeits pieces that cannot be moved although some rule variations make capturing optional 91 3 93 in almost all variants the player without pieces remaining or who cannot move due to being blocked loses the game pieces edit man edit an uncrowned piece man moves one step diagonally forwards and captures an adjacent opponent s piece by jumping over it and landing on the next square multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may zigzag change diagonal direction in american checkers men can jump only forwards in international draughts and russian draughts men can jump both forwards and backwards king edit a game in international draughts 10 10 board featuring a flying king the move les blancs prennent 6 pions when a man reaches the farthest row forward known as the kings row or crown head it becomes a king it is marked by placing an additional piece on top of or crowning the first man the king has additional powers including the ability to move backwards and in variants where men cannot already do so capture backwards like a man a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy piece in international draughts kings also called flying kings move any distance along unblocked diagonals they may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete it is possible to reach a position in a multi jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped flying kings are not used in american checkers a king s only advantage over a man is the additional ability to move and capture backwards naming edit in most non english languages except those that acquired the game from english speakers checkers is called dame dames damas or a similar term that refers to ladies the pieces are

robotic arm by colne robotics and was powered by a 6502 processor with a combination of basic and assembly code to interactively play a round of checkers with visitors to the museum originally the program was deliberately simple so that the average museum visitor could potentially win but over time was improved the improvements however proved to be more frustrating for the visitors so the original code was reimplemented 91 27 93 computational complexity edit generalized checkers is played on an n n board it is pspace hard to determine whether a specified player has a winning strategy and if a polynomial bound is placed on the number of moves that are allowed in between jumps which is a reasonable generalisation of the drawing rule in standard checkers then the problem is in pspace
