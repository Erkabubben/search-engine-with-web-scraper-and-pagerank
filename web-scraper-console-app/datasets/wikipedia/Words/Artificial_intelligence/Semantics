links history edit in english the study of meaning in language has been known by many names that involve the ancient greek word sema sign mark token in 1690 a greek rendering of the term semiotics the interpretation of signs and symbols finds an early allusion in john locke s an essay concerning human understanding the third branch may be called simeiotik semiotics or the doctrine of signs the most usual whereof being words it is aptly enough termed also logick in 1831 the term sematology is suggested for the third branch of division of knowledge akin to locke the signs of our knowledge 91 2 93 in 1857 the term semasiology borrowed from german semasiologie is attested in josiah w gibbs philological studies with english illustrations 91 3 93 the development of intellectual and moral ideas from physical constitutes an important part of semasiology or that branch of grammar which treats of the development of the meaning of words it is built on the analogy and correlation of the physical and intellectual worlds in 1893 the term semantics is used to translate french s mantique as used by michel br al 91 4 93 some years later in essai de s mantique br al writes 91 5 93 what i have tried to do is to draw some broad lines to mark some divisions and as a provisional plan on a field not yet exploited and which requires the combined work of several generations of linguists i therefore ask the reader to consider this book as a simple introduction to the science i have proposed to call semantics in footnote the science of significations i e what it means from the verb to signify as opposed to phonetics the science of sounds i e what it sounds like in 1922 the concept of semantics is attested in mathematical logic amidst a group of scholars in poland including leon chwistek le niewski ukasiewicz kotarbinski adjukiewicz and tarski according to allen walker read they had been influenced by french culture moreover later their work influenced alfred korzybski s usage of the term 91 2 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 in the 1960s semantics for programming languages is attested in publications by robert w floyd and tony hoare later termed axiomatic semantics its chief application is formal verification of computer programs some years later the terms operational semantics and denotational semantics emerged 91 8 93 floyd in the lead to his 1967 paper assigning meanings to programs writes 91 9 93 a semantic definition of a programming language in our approach is founded on a syntactic definition it must specify which of the phrases in a syntactically correct program represent commands and what conditions must be imposed on an interpretation in the neighborhood of each command linguistics edit in linguistics semantics is the subfield that studies meaning 91 10 93 semantics can address meaning at the levels of words phrases sentences or larger units of discourse two of the fundamental issues in the field of semantics are that of compositional semantics which pertains on how smaller parts like words combine and interact to form the meaning of larger expressions such as sentences and lexical semantics the nature of the meaning of words 91 10 93 other prominent issues are those of context and its role on interpretation opaque contexts ambiguity vagueness entailment and presuppositions 91 10 93 several disciplines and approaches have contributed to the often contentious field of semantics one of the crucial questions which unites different approaches to linguistic semantics is that of the relationship between form and meaning 91 11 93 some major contributions to the study of semantics have derived from studies in the 1980 1990s in related subjects of the syntax semantics interface and pragmatics 91 10 93 the semantic level of language interacts with other modules or levels like syntax in which language is traditionally divided in linguistics it is typical to talk in terms of interfaces regarding such interactions between modules or levels for semantics the most crucial interfaces are considered those with syntax the syntax semantics interface pragmatics and phonology regarding prosody and intonation 91 10 93 disciplines and paradigms in linguistic semantics edit formal semantics edit main article formal semantics linguistics formal semantics seeks to identify domain specific mental operations which speakers perform when they compute a sentence s meaning on the basis of its syntactic structure theories of formal semantics are typically floated on top of theories of syntax such as generative syntax or combinatory categorial grammar and provided a model theory based on mathematical tools such as typed lambda calculi the field s central ideas are rooted in early twentieth century philosophical logic as well as later ideas about linguistic syntax it emerged as its own subfield in the 1970s after the pioneering work of richard montague and barbara partee and continues to be an active area of research conceptual semantics edit main article conceptual semantics this theory is an effort to explain properties of argument structure the assumption behind this theory is that syntactic properties of phrases reflect the meanings of the words that head them 91 12 93 with this theory linguists can better deal with the fact that subtle differences in word meaning correlate with other differences in the syntactic structure that the word appears in 91 12 93 the way this is gone about is by looking at the internal structure of words 91 13 93 these small parts that make up the internal structure of words are termed semantic primitives 91 13 93 cognitive semantics edit main article cognitive semantics cognitive semantics approaches meaning from the perspective of cognitive linguistics in this framework language is explained via general human cognitive abilities rather than a domain specific language module the techniques native to cognitive semantics are typically used in lexical studies such as those put forth by leonard talmy george lakoff dirk geeraerts and bruce wayne hawkins some cognitive semantic frameworks such as that developed by talmy take into account syntactic structures as well 91 14 93 lexical semantics edit main article lexical semantics a linguistic theory that investigates word meaning this theory understands that the meaning of a word is fully reflected by its context here the meaning of a word is constituted by its contextual relations 91 15 93 therefore a distinction between degrees of participation as well as modes of participation are made 91 15 93 in order to accomplish this distinction any part of a sentence that bears a meaning and combines with the meanings of other constituents is labeled as a semantic constituent semantic constituents that cannot be broken down into more elementary constituents are labeled minimal semantic constituents 91 15 93 cross cultural semantics edit various fields or disciplines have long been contributing to cross cultural semantics are words like love truth and hate universals 91 16 93 is even the word sense so central to semantics a universal or a concept entrenched in a long standing but culture specific tradition 91 17 93 these are the kind of crucial questions that are discussed in cross cultural semantics translation theory ethnolinguistics linguistic anthropology and cultural linguistics specialize in the field of comparing contrasting and translating words terms and meanings from one language to another see j g herder wilhelm von humboldt franz boas edward sapir and b l whorf philosophy sociology and anthropology have long established traditions in contrasting the different nuances of the terms and concepts we use online encyclopaedias such as the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy and wikipedia itself have greatly facilitated the possibilities of comparing the background and usages of key cultural terms in recent years the question of whether key terms are translatable or untranslatable has increasingly come to the fore of global discussions especially since the publication of barbara cassin s dictionary of untranslatables a philosophical lexicon in 2014 91 18 93 91 19 93 computational semantics edit main article computational semantics computational semantics is focused on the processing of linguistic meaning in order to do this concrete algorithms and architectures are described within this framework the algorithms and architectures are also analyzed in terms of decidability time space complexity data structures that they require and communication protocols 91 20 93 philosophy edit main articles theory of reference and meaning philosophy of language many of the formal approaches to semantics in mathematical logic and computer science originated in early twentieth century philosophy of language and philosophical logic initially the most influential semantic theory stemmed from gottlob frege and bertrand russell frege and russell are seen as the originators of a tradition in analytic philosophy to explain meaning compositionally via syntax and mathematical functionality ludwig wittgenstein a former student of russell is also seen as one of the seminal figures in the analytic tradition all three of these early philosophers of language were concerned with how sentences expressed information in the form of propositions they also dealt with the truth values or truth conditions a given sentence has in virtue of the proposition it expresses 91 21 93 in present day philosophy the term semantics is often used to refer to linguistic formal semantics which bridges both linguistics and philosophy there is also an active tradition of metasemantics which studies the foundations of natural language semantics 91 22 93 computer science edit main article semantics computer science in computer science the term semantics refers to the meaning of language constructs as opposed to their form syntax according to euzenat semantics provides the rules for interpreting the syntax which do not provide the meaning directly but constrains the possible interpretations of what is declared 91 23 93 programming languages edit the semantics of programming languages and other languages is an important issue and area of study in computer science like the syntax of a language its semantics can be defined exactly for instance the following statements use different syntaxes but lead the computer to perform the same operations add the value of a variable y to the value of a variable x and store the result in x statement programming languages x y c c c java javascript python ruby etc x y perl php x 160 x y ada algol algol 68 bcpl dylan eiffel j modula 2 oberon ocaml object pascal delphi

basic most dialects fortran matlab lua set x x y cach objectscript add y to x abap add y to x giving x cobol set a x x y batch incf x y common lisp x y x add def postscript y x forth various ways have been developed to describe the semantics of programming languages formally building on mathematical logic 91 24 93 operational semantics the meaning of a construct is specified by the computation it induces when it is executed on a machine in particular it is of interest how the effect of a computation is produced denotational semantics meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that represent the effect of executing the constructs thus only the effect is of interest not how it is obtained axiomatic semantics specific properties of the effect of executing the constructs are expressed as assertions thus there may be aspects of the executions that are ignored semantic models edit see also ontology information science the semantic web refers to the extension of the world wide web via embedding added semantic metadata using semantic data modeling techniques such as resource description framework rdf and web ontology language owl on the semantic web terms such as semantic network and semantic data model are used to describe particular types of data model characterized by the use of directed graphs in which the vertices denote concepts or entities in the world and their properties and the arcs denote relationships between them these can formally be described as description logic concepts and roles which correspond to owl classes and properties 91 25 93 psychology edit main article semantics psychology semantic memory edit in psychology semantic memory is memory for meaning 160 in other words the aspect of memory that preserves only the gist the general significance of remembered experience 160 while episodic memory is memory for the ephemeral details 160 the individual features or the unique particulars of experience the term episodic memory was introduced by tulving and schacter in the context of declarative memory which involved simple association of factual or objective information concerning its object word meaning is measured by the company they keep i e the relationships among words themselves in a semantic network the memories may be transferred intergenerationally or isolated in one generation due to a cultural disruption different generations may have different experiences at similar points in their own time lines this may then create a vertically heterogeneous semantic net for certain words in an otherwise homogeneous culture 91 26 93 in a network created by people analyzing their understanding of the word such as wordnet the links and decomposition structures of the network are few in number and kind and include part of kind of and similar links in automated ontologies the links are computed vectors without explicit meaning various automated technologies are being developed to compute the meaning of words latent semantic indexing and support vector machines as well as natural language processing artificial neural networks and predicate calculus techniques ideasthesia edit ideasthesia is a psychological phenomenon in which activation of concepts evokes sensory experiences for example in synesthesia activation of a concept of a letter e g that of the letter a evokes sensory like experiences e g of red color psychosemantics edit in the 1960s psychosemantic studies became popular after charles e osgood s massive cross cultural studies using his semantic differential sd method that used thousands of nouns and adjective bipolar scales a specific form of the sd projective semantics method 91 27 93 uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups factors of adjective scales most consistently found in cross cultural studies evaluation potency activity as found by osgood and reality organization complexity limitation as found in other studies in this method seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the object scale symmetry oss between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales for example the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be beauty power motion life work chaos law beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as very good on adjectives of evaluation related scales life as very real on reality related scales etc however deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types scales related bias and objects related bias this oss design meant to increase the sensitivity of the sd method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background 91 28 93 91 29 93 prototype theory edit another set of concepts related to fuzziness in semantics is based on prototypes the work of eleanor rosch in the 1970s led to a view that natural categories are not characterizable in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions but are graded fuzzy at their boundaries and inconsistent as to the status of their constituent members one may compare it with jung s archetype though the concept of archetype sticks to static concept some post structuralists are against the fixed or static meaning of the words derrida following nietzsche talked about slippages in fixed meanings 91 citation needed 93 systems of categories are not objectively out there in the world but are rooted in people s experience these categories evolve as learned concepts of the world 160 meaning is not an objective truth but a subjective construct learned from experience and language arises out of the grounding of our conceptual systems in shared embodiment and bodily experience 91 30 93 a corollary of this is that the conceptual categories i e the lexicon will not be identical for different cultures or indeed for every individual in the same culture this leads to another debate see the sapir whorf hypothesis or eskimo words for snow see also edit semantic technology notes edit the word is derived from the ancient greek word semantikos related to meaning significant from semaino to signify to indicate which is from sema sign mark token the plural is used in analogy with words similar to physics which was in the neuter plural in ancient greek and meant things relating
