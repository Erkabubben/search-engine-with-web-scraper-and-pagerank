big data from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search information assets characterized by high volume velocity and variety this article is about large collections of data for the band see big data band for the practice of buying and selling of personal and consumer data see surveillance capitalism non linear growth of digital global information storage capacity and the waning of analog storage 91 1 93 though used sometimes loosely partly because of a lack of formal definition the interpretation that seems to best describe big data is the one associated with large body of information that we could not comprehend when used only in smaller amounts 91 2 93 in it primary definition though big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data processing application software data with many fields rows offer greater statistical power while data with higher complexity more attributes or columns may lead to a higher false discovery rate 91 3 93 big data analysis challenges include capturing data data storage data analysis search sharing transfer visualization querying updating information privacy and data source big data was originally associated with three key concepts volume variety and velocity 91 4 93 the analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling thus a fourth concept veracity refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization s capacity to create and capture value from big data 91 5 93 current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics user behavior analytics or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data and seldom to a particular size of data set there is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large but that s not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem 91 6 93 analysis of data sets can find new correlations to spot business trends prevent diseases combat crime and so on 91 7 93 scientists business executives medical practitioners advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data sets in areas including internet searches fintech healthcare analytics geographic information systems urban informatics and business informatics scientists encounter limitations in e science work including meteorology genomics 91 8 93 connectomics complex physics simulations biology and environmental research 91 9 93 the size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices cheap and numerous information sensing internet of things devices aerial remote sensing software logs cameras microphones radio frequency identification rfid readers and wireless sensor networks 91 10 93 91 11 93 the world s technological per capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s 91 12 93 as of 2012 91 update 93 every day 2 5 exabytes 2 5 260 bytes of data are generated 91 13 93 based on an idc report prediction the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4 4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020 by 2025 idc predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data 91 14 93 according to idc global spending on big data and business analytics bda solutions is estimated to reach 215 7 billion in 2021 91 15 93 91 16 93 while statista report the global big data market is forecasted to grow to 103 billion by 2027 91 17 93 in 2011 mckinsey amp company reported if us healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality the sector could create more than 300 billion in value every year 91 18 93 in the developed economies of europe government administrators could save more than 100 billion 149 billion in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data 91 18 93 and users of services enabled by personal location data could capture 600 billion in consumer surplus 91 18 93 one question for large enterprises is determining who should own big data initiatives that affect the entire organization 91 19 93 relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data the processing and analysis of big data may require massively parallel software running on tens hundreds or even thousands of servers 91 20 93 what qualifies as big data varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools furthermore expanding capabilities make big data a moving target for some organizations facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options for others it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration 91 21 93 contents 1 definition 1 1 big data vs business intelligence 2 characteristics 3 architecture 4 technologies 5

some giving credit to john mashey for popularizing the term 91 22 93 91 23 93 big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture curate manage and process data within a tolerable elapsed time 91 24 93 big data philosophy encompasses unstructured semi structured and structured data however the main focus is on unstructured data 91 25 93 big data size is a constantly moving target as of 2012 91 update 93 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data 91 26 93 big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data sets that are diverse complex and of a massive scale 91 27 93 variety veracity and various other vs are added by some organizations to describe it a revision challenged by some industry authorities 91 28 93 the vs of big data were often referred to as the three vs four vs and five vs they represented the qualities of big data in volume variety velocity veracity and value 91 4 93 variability is often included as an additional quality of big data a 2018 definition states big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data and notes this represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used via parallel programming theories and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by codd s relational model 91 29 93 in a comparative study of big datasets kitchin and mcardle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases 91 30 93 for this reason other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait 91 31 93 instead of focusing on intrinsic characteristics of big data this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected stored made available and analyzed big data vs business intelligence edit the growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between big data and business intelligence 91 32 93 business intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things detect trends etc big data uses mathematical analysis optimization inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification 91 33 93 to infer laws regressions nonlinear relationships and causal effects from large sets of data with low information density 91 34 93 to reveal relationships and dependencies or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors 91 33 93 91 35 93 91 promotional source 93 characteristics edit shows the growth of big data s primary characteristics of volume velocity and variety big data can be described by the following characteristics volume the quantity of generated and stored data the size of the data determines the value and potential insight and whether it can be considered big data or not the size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes 91 36 93 variety the type and nature of the data the earlier technologies like rdbmss were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively however the change in type and nature from structured to semi structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies the big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture store and process the semi structured and unstructured variety data generated with high speed velocity and huge in size volume later these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage eventually the processing of structured data was still kept as optional either using big data or traditional rdbmss this helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media log files sensors etc big data draws from text images audio video plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion velocity the speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development big data is often available in real time compared to small data big data is produced more continually two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling recording and publishing 91 37 93 veracity the truthfulness or reliability of the data which refers to the data quality and the data value 91 38 93 big data must not only be large in size but also must be reliable in order to achieve value in the analysis of it the data quality of captured data can vary greatly affecting an accurate analysis 91 39 93 value the worth in information that can be achieved by the processing and analysis of large datasets value also can be measured by an assessment of the other qualities of big data 91 40 93 value may also represent the profitability of information that is retrieved from the analysis of big data variability the characteristic of the changing formats structure or sources of big data big data can include structured unstructured or combinations of structured and unstructured data big data analysis may integrate raw data from multiple sources the processing of raw data may also involve transformations of unstructured data to structured data other possible characteristics of big data are 91 41 93 exhaustive whether the entire system i e n textstyle n all is captured or recorded or not big data may or may not include all the available data from sources fine grained and uniquely lexical respectively the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified relational if the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining or meta analysis of different data sets extensional if new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily scalability if the size of the big data storage system can expand rapidly architecture edit big data repositories have existed in many forms often built by corporations with a special need commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s for many years wintercorp published the largest database report 91 42 93 91 promotional source 93 teradata corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing dbc 1012 system teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992 hard disk drives were 2 5 gb in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves teradata installed the first petabyte class rdbms based system in 2007 as of 2017 91 update 93 there are a few dozen petabyte class teradata relational databases installed the largest of which exceeds 50 pb systems up until 2008 were 100 structured relational data since then teradata has added unstructured data types including xml json and avro in 2000 seisint inc now lexisnexis risk solutions developed a c based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the hpcc systems platform this system automatically partitions distributes stores and delivers structured semi structured and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ecl data analysts working in ecl are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution in 2004 lexisnexis acquired seisint inc 91 43 93 and their high speed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of choicepoint inc when they acquired that company in 2008 91 44 93 in 2011 the hpcc systems platform was open sourced under the apache v2 0 license cern and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades usually analyzed via high throughput computing rather than the map reduce architectures usually meant by the current big data movement in 2004 google published a paper on a process called mapreduce that uses a similar architecture the mapreduce concept provides a parallel processing model and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data with mapreduce queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel the map step the results are then gathered and delivered the reduce step the framework was very successful 91 45 93 so others wanted to replicate the algorithm therefore an implementation of the mapreduce framework was adopted by an apache open source project named hadoop 91 46 93 apache spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the mapreduce paradigm as it adds in memory processing and the ability to set up many operations not just map followed by reducing mike2 0 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled big data solution offering 91 47 93 the methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources complexity in interrelationships and difficulty in deleting or modifying individual records 91 48 93 studies in 2012 showed that a multiple layer architecture was one option to address the issues that big data presents a distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds this type of architecture inserts data into a parallel dbms which implements the use of mapreduce and hadoop frameworks this type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end user by using a front end application server 91 49 93 the data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management this enables quick segregation of data into the data lake thereby reducing the overhead time 91 50 93 91 51 93 technologies edit a 2011 mckinsey global institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows 91 52 93 techniques for analyzing data such as a b testing machine learning and natural language processing big data technologies like business intelligence cloud computing and databases visualization such as charts graphs and other displays of the data multidimensional big data can also be represented as olap data cubes or mathematically tensors array database systems have set out to provide storage and high level query support on this data type additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor based computation 91 53 93 such as multilinear subspace learning 91 54 93 massively parallel processing mpp databases search based applications data mining 91 55 93 distributed file systems distributed cache e g burst buffer and memcached distributed databases cloud and hpc based infrastructure applications storage and computing resources 91 56 93 and the internet 91 citation needed 93 although many approaches and technologies have been developed it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data 91 57 93 some mpp relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data implicit is the ability to load monitor back up and optimize the use of the large data tables in the rdbms 91 58 93 91 promotional source 93 darpa s topological data analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called ayasdi 91 59 93 91 third party source needed 93 the practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage 91 60 93 preferring direct attached storage das in its various forms from solid state drive ssd to high capacity sata disk buried inside parallel processing nodes the perception of shared storage architectures storage area network san and network attached storage nas is that they are relatively slow complex and expensive these qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance commodity infrastructure and low cost real or near real time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible data in direct attached memory or disk is good data on memory or disk at the other end of an fc san connection is not the cost of an san at the scale needed for analytics applications is much higher than other storage techniques applications edit bus wrapped with sap big data parked outside idf13 big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that software ag oracle corporation ibm microsoft sap emc hp and dell have spent more than 15 160 billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics in 2010 this industry was worth more than 100 160 billion and was growing at almost 10 160 percent a year about twice as fast as the software business as a whole 91 7 93 developed economies increasingly use data intensive technologies there are 4 6 160 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide and between 1 160 billion and 2 160 billion people accessing the internet 91 7 93 between 1990 and 2005 more than 1 160 billion people worldwide entered the middle class which means more people became more literate which in turn led to information growth the world s effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986 471 petabytes in 1993 2 2 exabytes in 2000 65 exabytes in 2007 91 12 93 and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014 91 7 93 according to one estimate one third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data 91 61 93 which is the format most useful for most big data applications this also shows the potential of yet unused data i e in the form of video and audio content while many vendors offer off the shelf products for big data experts promote the development of in house custom tailored systems if the company has sufficient technical capabilities 91 62 93 government edit see also government by algorithm the application of big data in the legal system together with analysis techniques is currently considered one of the possible ways to streamline the administration of justice the use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost productivity and innovation 91 63 93 but does not come without its flaws data analysis often requires multiple parts of government central and local to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome a common government organization that makes use of big data is the national security administration nsa which monitors the activities of the internet constantly in search for potential patterns of suspicious or illegal activities their system may pick up civil registration and vital statistics crvs collects all certificates status from birth to death crvs is a source of big data for governments international development edit research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development also known as ict4d suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to international development 91 64 93 91 65 93 advancements in big data analysis offer cost effective opportunities to improve decision making in critical development areas such as health care employment economic productivity crime security and natural disaster and resource management 91 66 93 91 67 93 91 68 93 additionally user generated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice 91 69 93 however longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy imperfect methodology and interoperability issues 91 66 93 the challenge of big data for development 91 66 93 is currently evolving toward the application of this data through machine learning known as artificial intelligence for development ai4d 91 70 93 benefits edit a major practical application of big data for development has been fighting poverty with data 91 71 93 in 2015 blumenstock and colleagues estimated predicted poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata 91 72 93 and in 2016 jean and colleagues combined satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty 91 73 93 using digital trace data to study the labor market and the digital economy in latin america hilbert and colleagues 91 74 93 91 75 93 argue that digital trace data has several benefits such as thematic coverage including areas that were previously difficult or impossible to measure geographical coverage our international sources provided sizable and comparable data for almost all countries including many small countries that usually are not included in international inventories level of detail providing fine grained data with many interrelated variables and new aspects like network connections timeliness and timeseries graphs can be produced within days of being collected challenges edit at the same time working with digital trace data instead of traditional survey data does not eliminate the traditional challenges involved when working in the field of international quantitative analysis priorities change but the basic discussions remain the same among the main challenges are representativeness while traditional development statistics is mainly concerned with the representativeness of random survey samples digital trace data is never a random sample 91 76 93 generalizability while observational data always represents this source very well it only represents what it represents and nothing more while it is tempting to generalize from specific observations of one platform to broader settings this is often very deceptive harmonization digital trace data still requires international harmonization of indicators it adds the challenge of so called data fusion the harmonization of different sources data overload analysts and institutions are not used to effectively deal with a large number of variables which is efficiently done with interactive dashboards practitioners still lack a standard workflow that would allow researchers users and policymakers to efficiently and effectively 91 74 93 finance edit big data is being rapidly adopted in finance to 1 speed up processing and 2 deliver better more informed inferences both internally and to the clients of the financial institutions 91 77 93 the financial applications of big data range from investing decisions and trading processing volumes of available price data limit order books economic data and more all at the same time portfolio management optimizing over an increasingly large array of financial instruments potentially selected from different asset classes risk management credit rating based on extended information and any other aspect where the data inputs are large 91 78 93 healthcare edit big data analytics was used in healthcare by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics waste and care variability reduction automated external and internal reporting of patient data standardized medical terms and patient registries 91 79 93 91 80 93 91 81 93 91 82 93 some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented the level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial with the added adoption of mhealth ehealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase this includes electronic health record data imaging data patient generated data sensor data and other forms of difficult to process data there is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality 91 83 93 big data very often means dirty data and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed 91 84 93 while extensive information in healthcare is now electronic it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use 91 85 93 the use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights privacy and autonomy to transparency and trust 91 86 93 big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research as data driven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesis driven research 91 87 93 then trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional hypothesis driven follow up biological research and eventually clinical research a related application sub area that heavily relies on big data within the healthcare field is that of computer aided diagnosis in medicine 91 88 93 for instance for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create 5 to 10 gb of data daily 91 89 93 similarly a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages 450 mb of data 91 90 93 these are just a few of the many examples where computer aided diagnosis uses big data for this reason big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computer aided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance 91 91 93 education edit a mckinsey global institute study found a shortage of 1 5 million highly trained data professionals and managers 91 52 93 and a number of universities 91 92 93 91 better 160 source 160 needed 93 including university of tennessee and uc berkeley have created masters programs to meet this demand private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand including free programs like the data incubator or paid programs like general assembly 91 93 93 in the specific field of marketing one of the problems stressed by wedel and kannan 91 94 93 is that marketing has several sub domains e g advertising promotions product development branding that all use different types of data media edit to understand how the media uses big data it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process it has been suggested by nick couldry and joseph turow that practitioners in media and advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals the industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers magazines or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations the ultimate aim is to serve or convey a message or content that is statistically speaking in line with the consumer s mindset for example publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages advertisements and content articles to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data mining activities 91 95 93 targeting of consumers for advertising by marketers 91 96 93 data capture data journalism publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics channel 4 the british public service television broadcaster is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis 91 97 93 insurance edit health insurance providers are collecting data on social determinants of health such as food and tv consumption marital status clothing size and purchasing habits from which they make predictions on health costs in order to spot health issues in their clients it is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing 91 98 93 internet of things iot edit main article internet of things further information edge computing big data and the iot work in conjunction data extracted from iot devices provides a mapping of device inter connectivity such mappings have been used by the media industry companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency the iot is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data and this sensory data has been used in medical 91 99 93 manufacturing 91 100 93 and transportation 91 101 93 contexts kevin ashton the digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term 91 102 93 defines the internet of things in this quote if we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things using data they gathered without any help from us we would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste loss and cost we would know when things needed replacing repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best information technology edit especially since 2015 big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology it the use of big data to resolve it and data collection issues within an enterprise is called it operations analytics itoa 91 103 93 by applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing it departments can

impact of the disease significant applications of big data included minimising the spread of the virus case identification and development of medical treatment 91 150 93 governments used big data to track infected people to minimise spread early adopters included china taiwan south korea and israel 91 151 93 91 152 93 91 153 93 research activities edit encrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in march 2014 at the american society of engineering education gautam siwach engaged at tackling the challenges of big data by mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and amir esmailpour at the unh research group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections they focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and real time examples within the technology moreover they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data 91 154 93 in march 2012 the white house announced a national big data initiative that consisted of six federal departments and agencies committing more than 200 160 million to big data research projects 91 155 93 the initiative included a national science foundation expeditions in computing grant of 10 million over five years to the amplab 91 156 93 at the university of california berkeley 91 157 93 the amplab also received funds from darpa and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion 91 158 93 to fighting cancer 91 159 93 the white house big data initiative also included a commitment by the department of energy to provide 25 million in funding over five years to establish the scalable data management analysis and visualization sdav institute 91 160 93 led by the energy department s lawrence berkeley national laboratory the sdav institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the department s supercomputers the u s state of massachusetts announced the massachusetts big data initiative

project will be used as input for horizon 2020 their next framework program 91 163 93 the british government announced in march 2014 the founding of the alan turing institute named after the computer pioneer and code breaker which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets 91 164 93 at the university of waterloo stratford campus canadian open data experience code inspiration day participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world 91 165 93 computational social sciences 160 anyone can use application programming interfaces apis provided by big data holders such as google and twitter to do research in the social and behavioral sciences 91 166 93 often these apis are provided for free 91 166 93 tobias preis et al used google trends data to demonstrate that internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic products gdps are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past the findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviors and real world economic indicators 91 167 93 91 168 93 91 169 93 the authors of the study examined google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year 2011 to the volume of searches for the previous year 2009 which they call the future orientation index 91 170 93 they compared the future orientation index to the per capita gdp of each country and found a strong tendency for countries where google users inquire more about the future to have a higher gdp tobias preis and his colleagues helen susannah moat and h eugene stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by google trends 91 171 93 their analysis of google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance published in scientific reports 91 172 93 suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets 91 173 93 91 174 93 91 175 93 91 176 93 91 177 93 91 178 93 91 179 93 big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist hence there is seen by some to be a need to fundamentally change the processing ways 91 180 93 the workshops on algorithms for modern massive data sets mmds bring together computer scientists statisticians mathematicians and data analysis practitioners to discuss algorithmic challenges of big data 91 181 93 regarding big data such concepts of magnitude are relative as it is stated if the past is of any guidance then today s big data most likely will not be considered as such in the near future 91 88 93 sampling big data edit a research question that is asked about big data sets is whether it is necessary to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or if is a sample is good enough the name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data but sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population in manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics vibration pressure current voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals to predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient big data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic psychographic behavioral and transactional data with large sets of data points marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting there has been some work done in sampling algorithms for big data a theoretical formulation for sampling twitter data has been developed 91 182 93 critique edit critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors those that question the implications of the approach itself and those that question the way it is currently done 91 183 93 one approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies critiques of the big data paradigm edit a crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro processes that lead to the emergence of the se typical network characteristics of big data 91 24 93 in their critique snijders matzat and reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro processes mark graham has leveled broad critiques at chris anderson s assertion that big data will spell the end of theory 91 184 93 focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social economic and political contexts 91 185 93 even as companies invest eight and nine figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers less than 40 of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so to overcome this insight deficit big data no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed must be complemented by big judgment according to an article in the harvard business review 91 186 93 much in the same line it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably informed by the world as it was in the past or at best as it currently is 91 66 93 fed by a large number of data on past experiences algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past 91 187 93 if the system s dynamics of the future change if it is not a stationary process the past can say little about the future in order to make predictions in changing environments it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic which requires theory 91 187 93 as a response to this critique alemany oliver and vayre suggest to use abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers digital traces and make new theories emerge 91 188 93 additionally it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations such as agent based models 91 66 93 and complex systems agent based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms 91 189 93 91 190 93 finally the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data such as factor analysis and cluster analysis have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi variate approaches e g contingency tables typically employed with smaller data sets in health and biology conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation for these approaches the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis 91 191 93 a new postulate is accepted now in biosciences the information provided by the data in huge volumes omics without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation 91 192 93 91 193 93 in the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor 91 194 93 the search logic is reversed and the limits of induction glory of science and philosophy scandal c d broad 1926 are to be considered 91 citation needed 93 privacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy 91 195 93 the misuse of big data in several cases by media companies and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society 91 196 93 nayef al rodhan argues that a new kind of social contract will be needed to protect individual liberties in the context of big data and giant corporations that own vast amounts of information and that the use of big data should be monitored and better regulated at the national and international levels 91 197 93 barocas and nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected with whom it is shared under what constraints and for what purposes 91 198 93 critiques of the v model edit the v model of big data is concerning as it centers around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information this led to the framework of cognitive big data which characterizes big data applications according to 91 199 93 data completeness understanding of the non obvious from data data correlation causation and predictability causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability explainability and interpretability humans desire to understand and accept what they understand where algorithms do not cope with this level of automated decision making algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic self learning critiques of novelty edit large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century including the us census analytics performed by ibm s punch card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent in more recent decades science experiments such as cern have produced data on similar scales to current commercial big data however science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custom built high performance computing super computing clusters and grids rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave implying a difference in both culture and technology stack critiques of big data execution edit ulf dietrich reips and uwe matzat wrote in 2014 that big data had become a fad in scientific research 91 166 93 researcher danah boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data 91 200 93 this approach may lead to results that have a bias in one way or another 91 201 93 integration across heterogeneous data resources some that might be considered big data and others not presents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science 91 202 93 in the provocative article critical questions for big data 91 203 93 the authors title big data a part of mythology large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge with the aura of truth objectivity and accuracy users of big data are often lost in the sheer volume of numbers and working with big data is still subjective and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth 91 203 93 recent developments in bi domain such as pro active reporting especially target improvements in the usability of big data through automated filtering of non useful data and correlations 91 204 93 big structures are full of spurious correlations 91 205 93 either because of non causal coincidences law of truly large numbers solely nature of big randomness 91 206 93 ramsey theory or existence of non included factors so the hope of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers speak for themselves and revolutionize scientific method is questioned 91 207 93 catherine tucker has pointed to hype around big data writing by itself big data is unlikely to be valuable the article explains the many contexts where data is cheap relative to the cost of retaining talent to process it suggests that processing skills are more important than data itself in creating value for a firm 91 208 93 big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets 91 209 93 in many big data projects there is no large data analysis happening but the challenge is the extract transform load part of data pre processing 91 209 93 big data is a buzzword and a vague term 91 210 93 91 211 93 but at the same time an obsession 91 211 93 with entrepreneurs consultants scientists and the media big data showcases such as google flu trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two similarly academy awards and election predictions solely based on twitter were more often off than on target big data often poses the same challenges as small data adding more data does not solve problems of bias but may emphasize other problems in particular data sources such as twitter are not representative of the overall population and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions google translate which is based on big data statistical analysis of text does a good job at translating web pages however results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed on the other hand big data may also introduce new problems such as the multiple comparisons problem simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant ioannidis argued that most published research findings are false 91 212 93 due to essentially the same effect when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments i e process a big amount of scientific data although not with big data technology the likelihood of a significant result being false grows fast even more so when only positive results are published furthermore big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated in an example big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 u s presidential election 91 213 93 with varying degrees of success critiques of big data policing and surveillance edit big data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations 91 214 93 due to the less visible nature of data based surveillance as compared to traditional methods of policing objections to big data policing are less likely to arise according to sarah brayne s big data surveillance the case of policing 91 215 93 big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways placing people under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace thus creating obstacles to social inclusion if these potential problems are not corrected or regulated the effects of big data policing may continue to shape societal hierarchies conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases brayne also notes in popular
