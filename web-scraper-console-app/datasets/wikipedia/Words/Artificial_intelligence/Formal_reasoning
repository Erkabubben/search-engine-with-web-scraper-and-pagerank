160 philosophy 32 portalvte reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information with the aim of seeking the truth 91 1 93 91 2 93 it is closely 91 how 93 associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy science language mathematics and art and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans 91 3 93 reason is sometimes referred to as rationality 91 4 93 reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition and involves the use of one s intellect the field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments 91 5 93 reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning such as deductive reasoning inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning reason proper and intuitive reasoning 91 6 93 in which the reasoning process through intuition however valid may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque in some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial for example in mathematics intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks reasoning like habit or intuition is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea for example reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect truth and falsehood or ideas regarding notions of good or evil reasoning as a part of executive decision making is also closely identified with the ability to self consciously change in terms of goals beliefs attitudes traditions and institutions and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self determination 91 7 93 in contrast to the use of reason as an abstract noun a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events phenomena or behavior 91 8 93 reasons justify decisions reasons support explanations of natural phenomena reasons can be given to explain the actions conduct of individuals using reason or reasoning can also be described more plainly as providing good or the best reasons for example when evaluating a moral decision morality is at the very least the effort to guide one s conduct by reason that is doing what there are the best reasons for doing while giving equal and impartial weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does 91 9 93 psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason e g which cognitive and neural processes are engaged and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw the field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning

related words represent words which have always been used to translate latin and classical greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage the original greek term was logos the root of the modern english word logic but also a word which could mean for example speech or explanation or an account of money handled 91 10 93 as a philosophical term logos was translated in its non linguistic senses in latin as ratio this was originally not just a translation used for philosophy but was also commonly a translation for logos in the sense of an account of money 91 11 93 french raison is derived directly from latin and this is the direct source of the english word reason 91 8 93 the earliest major philosophers to publish in english such as francis bacon thomas hobbes and john locke also routinely wrote in latin and french and compared their terms to greek treating the words logos ratio raison and reason as interchangeable the meaning of the word reason in senses such as human reason also overlaps to a large extent with rationality and the adjective of reason in philosophical contexts is normally rational rather than reasoned or reasonable 91 12 93 some philosophers thomas hobbes for example also used the word ratiocination as a synonym for reasoning philosophical history edit francisco de goya the sleep of reason produces monsters el sue o de la raz n produce monstruos c 1797 the proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science starting with classical greece philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times reason is often said to be reflexive or self correcting and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy 91 13 93 it has been defined in different ways at different times by different thinkers about human nature classical philosophy edit for many classical philosophers nature was understood teleologically meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose that fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims perhaps starting with pythagoras or heraclitus the cosmos is even said to have reason 91 14 93 reason by this account is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature such as sociability because it is something humans share with nature itself linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself within the human mind or soul psyche reason was described by plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts such as spiritedness thumos and the passions aristotle plato s student defined human beings as rational animals emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature he defined the highest human happiness or well being eudaimonia as a life which is lived consistently excellently and completely in accordance with reason 91 15 93 the conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of aristotle and plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy 91 16 93 but teleological accounts such as aristotle s were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way that is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul for example in the neoplatonist account of plotinus the cosmos has one soul which is the seat of all reason and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul reason is for plotinus both the provider of form to material things and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source 91 17 93 christian and islamic philosophy edit the classical view of reason like many important neoplatonic and stoic ideas was readily adopted by the early church 91 18 93 as the church fathers saw greek philosophy as an indispensable instrument given to mankind so that we may understand revelation 91 19 93 for example the greatest among the early saint church fathers and doctors of the church such as augustine of hippo basil of caesarea and gregory of nyssa were as much neoplatonic philosophers as they were christian theologians and adopted the neoplatonic view of human reason together with the associated implications for our relationship to creation to ourselves and to god such neoplatonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were also standard amongst medieval islamic philosophers and remain important in iranian philosophy 91 16 93 as european intellectualism recovered from the post roman dark ages the christian patristic heritage and the influence of the great islamic scholars such as averroes and avicenna produced the scholastic see scholasticism view of reason from which our modern idea of this concept has developed 91 20 93 among the scholastics who relied on the classical concept of reason for the development of their doctrines none were more influential than saint thomas aquinas who put this concept at the heart of his natural law in this doctrine thomas concludes that because humans have reason and because reason is a spark of the divine every single human life is invaluable all humans are equal and every human is born with an intrinsic and permanent set of basic rights 91 21 93 on this foundation the idea of human rights would later be constructed by spanish theologians at the school of salamanca other scholastics such as roger bacon and albertus magnus following the example of islamic scholars such as alhazen emphasised reason an intrinsic human ability to decode the created order and the structures that underlie our experienced physical reality this interpretation of reason was instrumental to the development of the scientific method in the early universities of the high middle ages 91 22 93 subject centred reason in early modern philosophy edit the early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason starting in europe one of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world 91 23 93 nature was no longer assumed to be human like with its own aims or reason and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same laws of nature which affect inanimate things this new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe ren descartes accordingly in the 17th century ren descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as rational animals suggesting instead that they are nothing more than thinking things along the lines of other things in nature any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was therefore subject to doubt in his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt all knowledge except that of the mind itself in the process of thinking at this time i admit nothing that is not necessarily true i am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing that is a mind or intellect or understanding or reason words of whose meanings i was previously ignorant 91 24 93 this eventually became known as epistemological or subject centred reason because it is based on the knowing subject who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts such as reason and intellect describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity a contemporary of descartes thomas hobbes described reason as a broader version of addition and subtraction which is not limited to numbers 91 25 93 this understanding of reason is sometimes termed calculative reason similar to descartes hobbes asserted that no discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact past or to come but that sense and memory is absolute knowledge 91 26 93 in the late 17th century through the 18th century john locke and david hume developed descartes s line of thought still further hume took it in an especially skeptical direction proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone even if it seems otherwise 91 27 93 91 28 93 hume famously remarked that we speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them 91 29 93 hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing unlike his predecessors that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas or from judgments associating two ideas 91 30 93 and that reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls which carries us along a certain train of ideas and endows them with particular qualities according to their particular situations and relations 91 31 93 it followed from this that animals have reason only much less complex than human reason in the 18th century immanuel kant attempted to show that hume was wrong by demonstrating that a transcendental self or i was a necessary condition of all experience therefore suggested kant on the basis of such a self it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge and so long as these limits are respected reason can be the vehicle of morality justice aesthetics theories of knowledge epistemology and understanding substantive and formal reason edit in the formulation of kant who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject the great achievement of reason german vernunft is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law making kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral practical theoretical and aesthetic reasoning on universal laws here practical reasoning is the self legislating or self governing formulation of universal norms and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws of nature 91 32 93 under practical reason the moral autonomy or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason this contrasted with earlier forms of morality which depended on religious understanding and interpretation or nature for their substance 91 33 93 according to kant in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason he formulated such a principle called the categorical imperative which would justify an action only if it could be universalized act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law 91 34 93 in contrast to hume then kant insists that reason itself german vernunft has natural ends the solution to the metaphysical problems especially the discovery of the foundations of morality kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his transcendental logic which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument which can be used indifferently as it was for aristotle but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others 91 35 93 according to j rgen habermas the substantive unity of reason has dissolved in modern times such that it can no longer answer the question how should i live instead the unity of reason has to be strictly formal or procedural he thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres on the model of kant s three critiques cognitive instrumental reason is the kind of reason employed by the sciences it is used to observe events to predict and control outcomes and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses moral practical reason is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm according to universalizable procedures similar to kant s categorical imperative and aesthetic reason is typically found in works of art and literature and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody for habermas these three spheres are the domain of experts and therefore need to be mediated with the lifeworld by philosophers in drawing such a picture of reason habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason which in pre modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life could be made up for by the unity of reason s formalizable procedures 91 36 93 the critique of reason edit hamann herder kant hegel kierkegaard nietzsche heidegger foucault rorty and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means or ought to mean some like kierkegaard nietzsche and rorty are skeptical about subject centred universal or instrumental reason and even skeptical toward reason as a whole others including hegel believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity or spirit in human life and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be some thinkers e g foucault believe there are other forms of reason neglected but essential to modern life and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason 91 13 93 in the last several decades a number of proposals have been made to re orient this critique of reason or to recognize the other voices or new departments of reason for example in opposition to subject centred reason habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity 91 37 93 nikolas kompridis has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness in human affairs and a focus on reason s possibilities for social change 91 38 93 the philosopher charles taylor influenced by the 20th century german philosopher martin heidegger has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life as a new department of reason 91 39 93 in the essay what is enlightenment michel foucault proposed a concept of critique based on kant s distinction between private and public uses of reason this distinction as suggested has two dimensions private reason is the reason that is used when an individual is a cog in a machine or when one has a role to play in society and jobs to do to be a soldier to have taxes to pay to be in charge of a parish to be a civil servant public reason is the reason used when one is reasoning as a reasonable being and not as a cog in a machine when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity in these circumstances the use of reason must be free and public 91 40 93 reason compared to related concepts edit compared to logic edit see also logic the terms logic or logical are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term reason or with the concept of being rational or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason logic is about reasoning about going from premises to a conclusion 160 when you do logic you try to clarify reasoning and separate good from bad reasoning 91 41 93 in modern economics rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice 91 42 93 reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct although logic is one important aspect of reason author douglas hofstadter in g del escher bach characterizes the distinction in this way logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps working backward drawing diagrams looking at examples or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system 91 43 93 psychologists mark h bickard and robert l campbell argued that rationality cannot be simply assimilated to logicality they noted that human knowledge of logic and logical systems has developed over time through reasoning and logical systems can t construct new logical systems more powerful than themselves so reasoning and rationality must involve more than a system of logic 91 44 93 91 45 93 psychologist david moshman citing bickhard and campbell argued for a metacognitive conception of rationality in which a person s development of reason involves increasing consciousness and control of logical and other inferences 91 45 93 91 46 93 reason is a type of thought and logic involves the attempt to describe a system of formal rules or norms of appropriate reasoning 91 45 93 the oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the greek philosopher aristotle especially prior analysis and posterior analysis 91 47 93 91 non primary source needed 93 although the ancient greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason aristotle s newly coined word syllogism syllogismos identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study 91 48 93 when aristotle referred to the logical h logik he was referring more broadly to rational thought 91 49 93 reason compared to cause and effect thinking and symbolic thinking edit main articles causality and symbols as pointed out by philosophers such as hobbes locke and hume some animals are also clearly capable of a type of associative thinking even to the extent of associating causes and effects a dog once kicked can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word it also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason 91 50 93 human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect perceptions of smoke for example and memories of fire for reason to be involved the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained for example as cause and effect in the explanation of locke for example reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism 91 51 93 more generally reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols as well as indices and icons according to charles sanders peirce the symbols having only a nominal though habitual connection to either smoke or fire 91 52 93 one example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is language the connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers thomas hobbes described the creation of markes or notes of remembrance leviathan ch 4 as speech he used the word speech as an english version of the greek word logos so that speech did not need to be communicated 91 53 93 when communicated such speech becomes language and the marks or notes or remembrance are called signes by hobbes going further back although aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason logos he does mention that animals with imagination for whom sense perceptions can persist come closest to having something like reasoning and nous and even uses the word logos in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases 91 54 93 reason imagination mimesis and memory edit main articles imagination mimesis memory and recollection reason and imagination rely on similar mental processes 91 55 93 imagination is not only found in humans aristotle for example stated that phantasia imagination that which can hold images or phantasmata and phronein a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense also exist in some animals 91 56 93 according to him both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals and without deliberation or logos but this is not yet reason because human imagination is different the recent modern writings of terrence deacon and merlin donald writing about the origin of language also connect reason connected to not only language but also mimesis 91 57 93 more specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind other results are consciousness and imagination or fantasy in contrast modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include noam chomsky and steven pinker to whom donald and deacon can be contrasted as reason is symbolic thinking and peculiarly human then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of icons or images and the real things they represent starting with a modern author merlin donald writes 91 58 93 a dog might perceive the meaning of a fight that was realistically play acted by humans but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent a real fight trained apes are able to make this distinction young children make this distinction early hence their effortless distinction between play acting an event and the event itself in classical descriptions an equivalent description of this mental faculty is eikasia in the philosophy of plato 91 59 93 this is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else related somehow but not the same and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such what klein refers to as dianoetic eikasia is the eikasia concerned specifically with thinking and mental images such as those mental symbols icons signes and marks discussed above as definitive of reason explaining reason from this direction human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible objects of thought as foundations hypoth ses in ancient greek this thinking dianoia is an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more precise no ta 91 60 93 both merlin donald and the socratic authors such as plato and aristotle emphasize the importance of mimesis often translated as imitation or representation donald writes 91 61 93 imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes but mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication mim sis is a concept now popular again in academic discussion that was particularly prevalent in plato s works and within aristotle it is discussed mainly in the poetics in michael davis s account of the theory of man in this work 91 62 93 it is the distinctive feature of human action that whenever we choose what we do we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside intentions are nothing more than imagined actions internalizings of the external all action is therefore imitation of action it is poetic 91 63 93 donald like plato and aristotle especially in on memory and recollection emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one s mental world the ancient greek anamn sis normally translated as recollection was opposed to mneme or memory memory shared with some animals 91 64 93 requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past but also that something happened in the past which is in other words a kind of eikasia 91 65 93 but nothing except man is able to recollect 91 66 93 recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known klein writes that to become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting 91 67 93 donald calls the same thing autocueing which he explains as follows 91 68 93 mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal self generated cues this permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations without the aid of external cues probably the earliest form of representational thinking in a celebrated paper in modern times the fantasy author and philologist j r r tolkien wrote in his essay on fairy stories that the terms fantasy and enchantment are connected to not only the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires but also the origin of language and of the mind logical reasoning methods and argumentation edit a subdivision of philosophy is logic logic is the study of reasoning looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning formal logic has been described as the science of deduction 91 69 93 the study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking deductive reasoning edit main article deductive reasoning deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises a deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process one classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in syllogisms like the following premise 1 all humans are mortal premise 2 socrates is a human conclusion socrates is mortal the reasoning in this argument is deductively valid because there is no way in which the premises 1 and 2 could be true and the conclusion 3 be false inductive reasoning edit main article inductive reasoning induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types either specifically or generally based on previous observation it is used to ascribe properties or relations to objects or types based on previous observations or experiences or to formulate general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that even in the best or strongest cases of inductive reasoning the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion instead the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability relatedly the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises thus this method of reasoning is ampliative a classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist david hume premise the sun has risen in the east every morning up until now conclusion the sun will also rise in the east tomorrow analogical reasoning edit main article analogical reasoning analogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular it is often used in case based reasoning especially legal reasoning 91 70 93 an example follows premise 1 socrates is human and mortal premise 2 plato is human conclusion plato is mortal analogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general 91 71 93 analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions for example premise 1 socrates is human and male premise 2 ada lovelace is human conclusion ada lovelace is male abductive reasoning edit main article abductive reasoning abductive reasoning or argument to the best explanation is a form of reasoning that doesn t fit in deductive or inductive since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations so the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved what distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others by subjective judgement or attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion given a set of more or less disputable assumptions for example when a patient displays certain symptoms there might be various possible causes but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable fallacious reasoning edit main articles fallacy formal fallacy and informal fallacy flawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form or structure of the argument the word formal refers to this link to the form of the argument an argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid an informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the content rather than mere structure of the argument traditional problems raised concerning reason edit philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim or philosophizing about philosophizing the first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge the other question is whether a life of reason a life that aims to be guided by reason can be expected to achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not reason versus truth and first principles edit see also truth first principle and nous since classical times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called platonism and aristotelianism concerning the role of reason in confirming truth people use logic deduction and induction to reach conclusions they think are true conclusions reached in this way are considered according to aristotle more certain than sense perceptions on their own 91 72 93 on the other hand if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions then our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better 91 73 93 this leads to the question of what types of first principles or starting points of reasoning are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions in greek first principles are archai starting points 91 74 93 and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in aristotle 91 75 93 and plato 91 76 93 as nous which was close in meaning to awareness or consciousness 91 77 93 empiricism sometimes associated with aristotle 91 78 93 but more correctly associated with british philosophers such as john locke and david hume as well as their ancient equivalents such as democritus asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth this approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable idealism associated with plato and his school claims that there is a higher reality from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth philosophers such as plato aristotle al farabi avicenna averroes maimonides aquinas and hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable perhaps by dialectic analysis or study in the vision of these thinkers reason is divine or at least has divine attributes such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as thomas aquinas and tienne gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible according to hegel the only thought which philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of history is the simple conception of reason that reason is the sovereign of the world that the history of the world therefore presents us with a rational process 91 79 93 since the 17th century rationalists reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty or rather the unaided ability pure reason to form concepts for descartes spinoza and leibniz this was associated with mathematics kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts time and space that are the conditions of experience kant made his argument in opposition to hume who denied that reason had any role to play in experience reason versus emotion or passion edit see also emotion and passion emotion after plato and aristotle western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites 91 citation needed 93 stoic philosophy by contrast claimed most emotions were merely false judgements 91 80 93 91 81 93 according to the stoics the only good is virtue and the only evil is vice therefore emotions that judged things other than vice to be bad such as fear or distress or things other than virtue to be good such as greed were simply false judgements and should be discarded though positive emotions based on true judgements such as kindness were acceptable 91 80 93 91 81 93 91 82 93 after the critiques of reason in the early enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions 91 citation needed 93 some enlightenment camps took after the stoics to say reason should oppose passion rather than order it while others like the romantics believed that passion displaces reason as in the maxim follow your heart 91 citation needed 93 reason has been seen as cold an enemy of mystery and ambiguity 91 83 93 a slave or judge of the passions notably in the work of david hume and more recently of freud 91 citation needed 93 reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called rationalization 91 citation needed 93 rousseau first proposed in his second discourse that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind 91 84 93 he asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind what other than reason and civil society best suits his constitution rousseau saw two principles prior to reason in human nature first we hold an intense interest in our own well being secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being especially one like ourselves 91 85 93 these two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve we become dependent upon each other and on relationships of authority and obedience this effectively puts the human race into slavery rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy according to richard velkley rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self correction most notably the political legislation of the contrat social and the moral education in mile all the same rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity this quandary presented by rousseau led to kant s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil these therefore are not to be blamed on nature or god in various ways german idealism after kant and major later figures such nietzsche bergson husserl scheler and heidegger remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or urges of reason 91 86 93 the influence of rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics many writers such as nikos kazantzakis extol passion and disparage reason in politics modern nationalism comes from rousseau s argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state 91 87 93 another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled descartes error by antonio damasio in it damasio presents the somatic marker hypothesis which states that emotions guide behavior and decision making damasio argues that these somatic markers known collectively as gut feelings are intuitive signals that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function reason versus faith or tradition edit main articles faith religion and tradition there are many religious traditions some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring suppressing or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects such as religious dogmas moral taboos etc 91 88 93 though the theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not admit to be irrational there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand and reason on the other as potentially competing sources of wisdom law and truth 91 89 93 91 90 93 religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled or have different non overlapping domains or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism reconciliation philosopher alvin plantinga argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains among other things why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it 91 91 93 91 92 93 non overlapping magisteria evolutionary biologist stephen jay gould argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain or magisterium 91 93 93 91 94 93 if so reason can work on those problems over which it has authority while other sources of knowledge or opinion can have authority on the big questions 91 95 93 tu quoque philosophers alasdair macintyre and charles taylor argue that those critics of traditional religion who are adherents of secular liberalism are also sometimes guilty of ignoring suppressing and forbidding some kinds of reasoning about subjects 91 96 93 91 97 93 similarly philosophers of science such as paul feyarabend argue that scientists sometimes ignore or suppress evidence contrary to the dominant paradigm unification theologian joseph ratzinger later benedict xvi asserted that christianity has understood itself as the religion of the logos as the religion according to reason referring to john 1 usually translated as in the beginning was the word logos thus he said that the christian faith is open to all that is truly rational and that the rationality of western enlightenment is of christian origin 91 98 93 some commentators have claimed that western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between unaided reason and faith in revealed truths figuratively summarized as athens and jerusalem respectively 91 99 93 91 100 93 leo strauss spoke of a greater west that included all areas under the influence of the tension between greek rationalism and abrahamic revelation including the muslim lands he was particularly influenced by the great muslim philosopher al farabi to consider to what extent eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to nature by which we mean physis in greek according to strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the discovery or invention of nature and the pre philosophical equivalent of nature was supplied by such notions as custom or ways which appear to be really universal in all times and places the philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding archai first principles of knowledge brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand and tradition or faith on the other 91 101 93 although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the islamic christian and jewish traditions the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature such as hinduism because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way 91 102 93 reason in particular fields of study edit psychology and cognitive science edit see also psychology of reasoning scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally it is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning and cognitive science of reasoning rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts behavioral experiments on human reasoning edit experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour such research may focus for example on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or iq tests or on how well people s reasoning matches ideals set by logic see for example the wason test 91 103 93 experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e g if a then b and how they make inferences about alternatives e g a or else b 91 104 93 they test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations e g a is to the left of b or a happens after b and about quantified assertions e g all the a are b 91 105 93 experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations hypothetical possibilities probabilities and counterfactual situations 91 106 93 developmental studies of children s reasoning edit developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood piaget s theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development subsequently several alternative theories were proposed including the neo piagetian theories of cognitive development 91 107 93 neuroscience of reasoning edit the biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists cognitive neuroscientists and neuropsychologists research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains in addition to carrying out research into reasoning some psychologists for example clinical psychologists and psychotherapists work to alter people s reasoning habits when they are unhelpful computer science edit automated reasoning edit main articles automated reasoning and computational logic see also reasoning system case based reasoning semantic reasoner

meta reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation 91 108 93 this requires a programming language capable of reflection the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour evolution of reason edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august 2017 dan sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness a species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about predict and understand the world french social and cognitive scientists dan sperber and hugo mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason they point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs confirmation bias reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective as demonstrated by the success of projects like science they suggest that there are not just individual but group selection pressures at play any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members increasing their fitness this could also help explain why humans according to sperber are not optimized to reason effectively alone their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth 91 109 93 91 110 93 reason in political philosophy and ethics edit main articles political philosophy ethics and the good aristotle famously described reason with language as a part of human nature which means that it is best for humans to live politically meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state polis in greek for example it is clear then that a human being is more of a political politikon of the polis animal z ion than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds for nature as we say makes nothing in vain and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech logos voice of course serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant that is why it is also found in other animals because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other but speech logos serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust for it is a peculiarity of humans in contrast to the other animals to have perception of good and bad just and unjust and the like and the community in these things makes a household or city polis by nature then the drive for such a community exists in everyone but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness for as humans are the best of all animals when perfected so they are the worst when divorced from law and right the reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses consequently if a human being lacks virtue he is the most unholy and savage thing and when it comes to sex and food the worst but justice is something political to do with the polis for right is the arrangement of the political community and right is discrimination of what is just aristotle s politics 1253a 1 2 peter simpson s translation with greek terms inserted in square brackets the concept of human nature being fixed in this way implied in other words that we can define what type of community is always best for people this argument has remained a central argument in all political ethical and moral thinking since then and has become especially controversial since firstly rousseau s second discourse and secondly the theory of evolution already in aristotle there was an awareness that the polis had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves the household came first and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that with the first cities being run as if they were still families with kings acting like fathers 91 111 93 friendship philia seems to prevail in man and woman according to nature kata phusin for people are by nature t i phusei pairing sunduastikon more than political politikon of the polis in as much as the household oikos is prior proteron earlier and more necessary than the polis and making children is more common koinoteron with the animals in the other animals community koin nia goes no further than this but people live together sumoikousin not only for the sake of making children but also for the things for life for from the start the functions erga are divided and are different for man and woman thus they supply each other putting their own into the common eis to koinon it is for these reasons that both utility chr simon and pleasure h du seem to be found in this kind of friendship nicomachean ethics viii 12 1162a rough literal translation with greek terms shown in square brackets rousseau in his second discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse with reason language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems and that once such cooperation became more important it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation often only to defend themselves from each other in other words according to rousseau reason language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods nor because of any pre existing human nature as a result he claimed living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape if anything is specifically human in this theory it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans this view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from charles darwin s theory of evolution the two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because according to the aristotelian theory a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances according to rousseau we should even doubt that reason language and politics are a good thing as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today rousseau s theory that human nature is malleable rather than fixed is often taken to imply for example by karl marx a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known however while rousseau s initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics including both the french revolution and the russian revolution his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical in favor of city states such as geneva and rural living see also edit philosophy portalpsychology portal
