industry miti to create computers using massively parallel computing and logic programming it aimed to create an epoch making computer with supercomputer like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence fgcs was ahead of its time and a commercial failure fgcs contributed greatly to the field of concurrent logic programming the term fifth generation was intended to convey the system as being advanced in the history of computing hardware computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation transistors and diodes the second integrated circuits the third and those using microprocessors the fourth whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single cpu the fifth generation it was widely believed at the time would instead turn to massive numbers of cpus for added performance contents 1 background 2 project launch 2 1 logic programming 3 results 3 1 concurrent logic programming 3 2 commercial failure 3 3 ahead of its time 4 references background edit in the late 1965s until the early 1970s there was much talk about generations of computer hardware 8212 usually three generations first generation thermionic vacuum tubes mid 1940s ibm pioneered the arrangement of vacuum tubes in pluggable modules the ibm 650 was a first generation computer second generation transistors 1956 the era of miniaturization begins transistors are much smaller than vacuum tubes draw less power and generate less heat discrete transistors are soldered to circuit boards with interconnections accomplished by stencil screened conductive patterns on the reverse side the ibm 7090 was a second generation computer third generation integrated circuits silicon chips containing multiple transistors 1964 a pioneering example is the acpx module used in the ibm 360 91 which by stacking layers of silicon over a ceramic substrate accommodated over 20 transistors per chip the chips could be packed together onto a circuit board to achieve unprecedented logic densities the ibm 360 91 was a hybrid second and third generation computer omitted from this taxonomy is the zeroth generation computer based on metal gears such as the ibm 407 or mechanical relays such as the mark i and the post third generation computers based on very large scale integrated vlsi circuits there was also a parallel set of generations for software first generation machine language second generation low level programming languages such as assembly language third generation structured high level programming languages such as c cobol and fortran fourth generation non procedural high level programming languages such as object oriented languages 91 1 93 throughout these multiple generations up to the 1970s japan built computers following u s and british leads in the mid 1970s the ministry of international trade and industry stopped following western leads and started looking into the future of computing on a small scale they asked the japan information processing development center jipdec to indicate a number of future directions and in 1979 offered a three year contract to carry out more in depth studies along with industry and academia it was during this period that the term fifth generation computer started to be used prior to the 1970s miti guidance had successes such as an improved steel industry the creation of the oil supertanker the automotive industry consumer electronics and computer memory miti decided that the future was going to be information technology however the japanese language particularly in its written form presented and still presents obstacles for computers 91 2 93 as a result of these hurdles miti held a conference to seek assistance from experts the primary fields for investigation from this initial project were inference computer technologies for knowledge processing computer technologies to process large scale data bases and knowledge bases high performance workstations distributed functional computer technologies super computers for scientific calculation project launch edit the aim was to build parallel computers for artificial intelligence applications using concurrent logic programming the project imagined an epoch making computer with supercomputer like performance running on top of large databases as opposed to a traditional filesystem using a logic programming language to define and access the data using massively parallel computing processing they envisioned building a prototype machine with performance between 100m and 1g lips where a lips is a logical inference per second at the time typical workstation machines were capable of about 100k lips they proposed to build this machine over a ten year period 3 years for initial r amp d 4 years for building various subsystems and a final 3 years to complete a working prototype system in 1982 the government decided to go ahead with the project and established the institute for new generation computer technology icot through joint investment with various japanese computer companies after the project ended miti would consider an investment in a new sixth generation project ehud shapiro captured the rationale and motivations driving this project 91 3 93 as part of japan s effort to become a leader in the computer industry the institute for new generation computer technology has launched a revolutionary ten year plan for the development of large computer systems which will be applicable to knowledge information processing systems these fifth generation computers will be built around the concepts of logic programming in order to refute the accusation that japan exploits knowledge from abroad without contributing any of its own this project will stimulate original research and will make its results available to the international research community logic programming edit the target defined by the fgcs project was to develop knowledge information processing systems roughly meaning applied artificial intelligence the chosen tool to implement this goal was logic programming logic programming approach as was characterized by maarten van emden one of its founders as 91 4 93 the use of logic to express information in a computer the use of logic to present problems to a computer the use of logical inference to solve these problems more technically it can be summed up in two equations program set of axioms computation proof of a statement from axioms the axioms typically used are universal axioms of a restricted form called horn clauses or definite clauses the statement proved in a computation is an existential statement 91 citation needed 93 the proof is constructive and provides values for the existentially quantified variables these values constitute the output of the computation logic programming was thought as something that unified various gradients of computer science software engineering databases computer architecture and artificial intelligence it seemed that logic programming was a key missing connection between knowledge engineering and parallel computer architectures results edit after having influenced the consumer electronics field during the 1970s and the automotive world during the 1980s the japanese had developed a strong reputation the launch of the fgcs project spread the belief that parallel computing was the future of all performance gains producing a wave of apprehension in the computer field soon parallel projects were set up in the us as the strategic computing initiative and the microelectronics and computer technology corporation mcc in the uk as alvey and in europe as the european strategic program on research in information technology esprit as well as the european computer industry research centre ecrc in munich a collaboration between icl in britain bull in france and siemens in germany the project ran from 1982 to 1994 spending a little less than 57 billion about us 320 million total 91 5 93 after the fgcs project miti stopped funding large scale computer research projects and the research momentum developed by the fgcs project dissipated however miti icot embarked on a neural net project 91 which 93 which some called the sixth generation project in the 1990s with a similar level of funding 91 6 93 per year spending was less than 1 of the entire r amp d expenditure of the electronics and communications equipment industry for example the project s highest expenditure year was 7 2 million yen in 1991 but ibm alone spent 1 5 billion dollars 370 billion yen in 1982 while the industry spent 2150 billion yen in 1990 91 5 93 concurrent logic programming edit in 1982 during a visit to the icot ehud shapiro invented concurrent prolog a novel programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming concurrent prolog is a process oriented language which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms shapiro described the language in a report marked as icot technical report 003 91 7 93 which presented a concurrent prolog interpreter written in prolog shapiro s work on concurrent prolog inspired a change in the direction of the fgcs from focusing on parallel implementation of prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project 91 3 93 it also inspired the concurrent logic programming language guarded horn clauses ghc by ueda which was the basis of kl1 the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the fgcs project as its core programming language the fgcs project and its findings contributed greatly to the development of the concurrent logic programming field the project produced a new generation of promising japanese researchers commercial failure edit five running parallel inference machines pim were eventually produced pim m pim p pim i pim k pim c the project also produced applications to run on these systems such as the parallel database management system kappa the legal reasoning system helic ii and the automated theorem prover mgtp as well as applications to bioinformatics the fgcs project did not meet with commercial success for reasons similar to the lisp machine companies and thinking machines the highly parallel computer architecture was eventually surpassed in speed by less specialized hardware for example sun workstations and intel x86 machines a primary problem was the choice of concurrent logic programming as the bridge between the parallel computer architecture and the use of logic as a knowledge representation and problem solving language for ai applications this never happened cleanly a number of languages were developed all with their own limitations in particular the committed choice feature of concurrent constraint logic programming interfered with the logical semantics of the languages 91 8 93 the project found that the promises of logic programming were largely negated by the use of committed choice 91 citation needed 93 another problem was that existing cpu performance quickly pushed through the barriers that experts perceived in the 1980s and the value of parallel computing dropped to the point where it was for some time used only in niche situations although a number of workstations of increasing capacity were designed and built over the project s lifespan they generally found themselves soon outperformed by off the shelf units available commercially the project also failed to maintain continuous growth during its lifespan guis became mainstream in computers the internet enabled locally stored databases to become distributed and even simple research projects provided better real world results in data mining 91 citation needed 93 the workstations had no appeal in a market where general purpose systems could now replace and outperform them this is parallel to the lisp machine market where rule based systems such as clips could run on general purpose computers making expensive lisp machines unnecessary 91 9 93 ahead of its time edit in summary the fifth generation project was revolutionary and accomplished some basic research that anticipated future research directions many papers and patents were published miti established a committee which assessed the performance of the fgcs project as having made major contributions in computing in particular eliminating bottlenecks in parallel processing software and the realization of intelligent interactive processing based on large knowledge bases however the committee was strongly biased to produce a positive outcome so this overstates the actual results 91 5 93 many of the themes seen in the fifth generation project are now being re interpreted in current technologies in the early 21st century many flavors of parallel computing began to proliferate including multi core architectures at the low end and massively parallel processing at the high end when clock speeds of cpus began to move into the 3 5 160 ghz range cpu power dissipation and other problems became more important the ability of industry to produce ever faster single cpu systems linked to moore s law about the periodic doubling of transistor counts began to be threatened ordinary consumer machines and game consoles began to have parallel processors like the intel core amd k10 and cell graphics card companies like nvidia and amd began introducing large parallel systems like cuda and opencl on another line of development the web ontology language owl employs several layers of logic based knowledge representation systems 91 citation needed 93 it appears however that these new technologies do not cite fgcs research it is not clear if fgcs was leveraged to facilitate these developments in any significant way no significant impact of fgcs on the computing industry has been demonstrated 91 citation needed 93
