programming languages glossary glossary vte the ai effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence 91 3 93 author pamela mccorduck writes it s part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something play good checkers solve simple but relatively informal problems there was a chorus of critics to say that s not thinking 91 4 93 researcher rodney brooks complains every time we figure out a piece of it it stops being magical we say oh that s just a computation 91 5 93 contents 1 definition 2 ai applications become mainstream 3 legacy of the ai winter 4 saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being 5 deep blue defeats kasparov 6 see also 7 notes 8 references 9 external links definition edit the ai effect is that line of thinking the tendency to redefine ai to mean ai is anything that has not been done yet this is the common public misperception that as soon as ai successfully solves a problem that solution method is no longer within the domain of ai mccorduck calls it an odd paradox that practical ai successes computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in and became silent partners alongside other problem solving approaches which left ai researchers to deal only with the failures the tough nuts that couldn t yet be cracked 91 6 93 tesler s theorem is ai is whatever hasn t been done yet larry tesler douglas hofstadter quotes this 91 7 93 as do many other commentators 91 8 93 when problems have not yet been formalised they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation the computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by a human this formalisation is referred to as human assisted turing machine 91 9 93 ai applications become mainstream edit software and algorithms developed by ai researchers are now integrated into many applications throughout the world without really being called ai this underappreciation is known from such diverse fields as computer chess 91 10 93 marketing 91 11 93 agricultural automation 91 8 93 and hospitality 91 12 93 michael swaine reports ai advances are not trumpeted as artificial intelligence so much these days but are often seen as advances in some other field ai has become more important as it has become less conspicuous patrick winston says these days it is hard to find a big system that does not work in part because of ideas developed or matured in the ai world 91 13 93 according to stottler henke the great practical benefits of ai applications and even the existence of ai in many software products go largely unnoticed by many despite the already widespread use of ai techniques in software this is the ai effect many marketing people don t use the term artificial intelligence even when their company s products rely on some ai techniques why not 91 11 93 marvin minsky writes this paradox resulted from the fact that whenever an ai research project made a useful new discovery that product usually quickly spun off to form a new scientific or commercial specialty with its own distinctive name these changes in name led outsiders to ask why do we see so little progress in the central field of artificial intelligence 91 14 93 nick bostrom observes that a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labelled ai anymore 91 15 93 the ai effect on decision making in supply chain risk management is a severely understudied area 91 16 93 to avoid the ai effect problem the editors of a special issue of ieee software on ai and software engineering recommend not overselling not hyping the real achievable results to start with 91 17 93 legacy of the ai winter edit main article ai winter many ai researchers find that they can get more funding and sell more software if they avoid the bad name of artificial intelligence and instead pretend their work has nothing to do with intelligence at all this was especially true in the early 1990s during the second ai winter patty tascarella writes some believe the word robotics actually carries a stigma that hurts a company s chances at funding 91 18 93 saving a place for humanity at the top of the chain of being edit michael kearns suggests that people subconsciously are trying to preserve for themselves some special role in the universe 91 19 93 by discounting artificial intelligence people can continue to feel unique and special kearns argues that the change in perception known as the ai effect can be traced to the mystery being removed from the system in being able to trace the cause of events implies that it s a form of automation rather than intelligence a related effect has been noted in the history of animal cognition and in consciousness studies where every time a capacity formerly thought as uniquely human is discovered in animals e g the ability to make tools or passing the mirror test the overall importance of that capacity is deprecated 91 citation needed 93 herbert a simon when asked about the lack of ai s press coverage at the time said what made ai different was that the very idea of it arouses a real fear and hostility in some human breasts so you are getting very strong emotional reactions but that s okay we ll live with that 91 20 93 mueller 1987 proposed comparing ai to human intelligence coining the standard of human level machine intelligence 91 21 93 this nonetheless suffers from the ai effect however when different humans are used as the standard 91 21 93 deep blue defeats kasparov edit when ibm s chess playing computer deep blue succeeded in defeating garry kasparov in 1997 people complained that it had only used brute force methods and it wasn t real intelligence 91 22 93 fred reed writes a problem that proponents of ai regularly face is this when we know how a machine does something intelligent it ceases to be regarded as intelligent if i beat the world s chess champion i d be regarded as highly bright 91 23 93 on the contrary john mccarthy was disappointed by deep blue 91 24 93 he argued that it was merely a brute force machine and did not have any deep understanding of the game 91 24 93 however that is not to say that mccarthy generally dismissed ai 91 24 93 he was one of the founders of the field and invented the term artificial intelligence 91 24 93 mccarthy lamented how widespread the ai effect is as soon as it works no one calls it ai anymore 91 24 93 but merely did not feel that deep blue was a good example 91 24 93 see also edit no true scotsman chinese room eliza effect functionalism philosophy of mind god of the gaps
