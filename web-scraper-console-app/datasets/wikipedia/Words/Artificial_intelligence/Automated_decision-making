automated decision making from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search decision making process conducted with varying degrees of human oversight automated decision making adm involves the use of data machines and algorithms to make decisions in a range of contexts including public administration business health education law employment transport media and entertainment with varying degrees of human oversight or intervention adm involves large scale data from a range of sources such as databases text social media sensors images or speech that is processed using various technologies including computer software algorithms machine learning natural language processing artificial intelligence augmented intelligence and robotics the increasing use of automated decision making systems adms across a range of contexts presents many benefits and challenges to human society requiring consideration of the technical legal ethical societal educational economic and health consequences 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 contents 1 overview 2 data 2 1 data quality 3 adm technologies 3 1 machine learning 4 applications 4 1 debate 4 2 law 4 3 economics 4 4 business 4 4 1

information asymmetry 6 research fields 7 see also 8 references overview edit there are different definitions of adm based on the level of automation involved some definitions suggests adm involves decisions made through purely technological means without human input 91 4 93 such as the eu s general data protection regulation article 22 however adm technologies and applications can take many forms ranging from decision support systems that make recommendations for human decision makers to act on sometimes known as augmented intelligence 91 5 93 or shared decision making 91 2 93 to fully automated decision making processes that make decisions on behalf of individuals or organizations without human involvement 91 6 93 models used in automated decision making systems can be as simple as checklists and decision trees through to artificial intelligence and deep neural networks dnn since the 1950s computers have gone from being able to do basic processing to having the capacity to undertake complex ambiguous and highly skilled tasks such as image and speech recognition game play scientific and medical analysis and inferencing across multiple data sources adm is now being increasingly deployed across all sectors of society and many diverse domains from entertainment to transport an adm system adms may involve multiple decision points data sets and technologies admt and may sit within a larger administrative or technical system such as a criminal justice system or business process data edit automated decision making involves the use of data as an input either to be analysed within a process model or algorithm or for learning and generating new models 91 7 93 adm systems may use and connect a wide range of data types and sources depending on the goals and contexts of the system for example sensor data for self driving cars and robotics identity data for security systems demographic and financial data for public administration medical records in health criminal records in law this can sometimes involve vast amounts of data and computing power data quality edit the quality of the data that is available and able to be used in adm systems is fundamental to the outcomes and is often highly problematic for many reasons datasets are often highly variable large scale data may be controlled by corporations or governments restricted for privacy or security reasons incomplete biased limited in terms of time or coverage measuring and describing terms in different ways and many other issues for machines to learn from data large corpuses are often required which can be difficult to obtain or compute however where available have provided significant breakthroughs for example in diagnosing chest x rays 91 8 93 adm technologies edit automated decision making technologies admt are software coded digital tools that automate the translation of input data to output data contributing to the function of automated decision making systems 91 7 93 there are a wide range of technologies in use across adm applications and systems admts involving basic computational operations search includes 1 2 1 1 2 many data matching merge matching two different things mathematical calculation formula admts for assessment and grouping user profiling recommender systems clustering classification feature learning predictive analytics includes forecasting admts relating to space and flows social network analysis includes link prediction mapping routing admts for processing of complex data formats image processing audio processing natural language processing nlp other admt business rules management systems time series analysis anomaly detection modelling simulation machine learning edit main article machine learning machine learning ml involves training computer programs through exposure to large data sets and examples to learn from experience and solve problems 91 2 93 machine learning can be used to generate and analyse data as well as make algorithmic calculations and has been applied to image and speech recognition translations text data and simulations while machine learning has been around for some time it is becoming increasingly powerful due to recent breakthroughs in training deep neural networks dnns and dramatic increases in data storage capacity and computational power with gpu coprocessors and cloud computing 91 2 93 machine learning systems based on foundation models run on deep neural networks and use pattern matching to train a single huge system on large amounts of general data such as text and images early models tended to start from scratch for each new problem however since the early 2020s many are able to be adapted to new problems 91 9 93 examples of these technologies include open ai s dall e an image creation program and gpt language model and google s palm language model program applications edit adm is being used to replace or augment human decision making by both public and private sector organisations for a range of reasons including to help increase consistency improve efficiency reduce costs and enable new solutions to complex problems 91 10 93 debate edit research and development are underway into uses of technology to assess argument quality 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 assess argumentative essays 91 14 93 91 15 93 and judge debates 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 potential applications of these argument technologies span education and society scenarios to consider in these regards include those involving the assessment and evaluation of conversational mathematical scientific interpretive legal and political argumentation and debate law edit in legal systems around the world algorithmic tools such as risk assessment instruments rai are being used to supplement or replace the human judgment of judges civil servants and police officers in many contexts 91 20 93 in the united states rai are being used to generate scores to predict the risk of recidivism in pre trial detention and sentencing decisions 91 21 93 evaluate parole for prisoners and to predict hot spots for future crime 91 22 93 91 23 93 91 24 93 these scores may result in automatic effects or may be used to inform decisions made by officials within the justice system 91 20 93 in canada adm has been used since 2014 to automate certain activities conducted by immigration officials and to support the evaluation of some immigrant and visitor applications 91 25 93 economics edit automated trading systems use computer programs to create buy and sell orders and automatically submit the orders to market centers or exchanges computer programs can automatically generate orders based on predefined set of rules using trading strategies which are based on technical analyses advanced statistical and mathematical computations or inputs from other electronic sources business edit continuous auditing edit continuous auditing uses advanced analytical tools to automate auditing processes it can be utilized in the private sector by business enterprises and in the public sector by governmental organizations and municipalities 91 26 93 as artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to advance accountants and auditors may make use of increasingly sophisticated algorithms which make decisions such as those involving determining what is anomalous whether to notify personnel and how to prioritize those tasks assigned to personnel media and entertainment edit digital media entertainment platforms and information services increasingly provide content to audiences via automated recommender systems based on demographic information previous selections collaborative filtering or content based filtering 91 27 93 this includes music and video platforms publishing health information product databases and search engines many recommender systems also provide some agency to users in accepting recommendations and incorporate data driven algorithmic feedback loops based on the actions of the system user 91 6 93 large scale machine learning language models and image creation programs being developed by companies such as openai and google in the 2020s have restricted access however they are likely to have wide spread application in fields such as advertising copywriting stock imagery and graphic design as well as other fields such as journalism and law 91 9 93 advertising edit online advertising is closely integrated with many digital media platforms websites and search engines and often involves automated delivery of display advertisements in diverse formats programmatic online advertising involves automating the sale and delivery of digital advertising on websites and platforms via software rather than direct human decision making 91 27 93 this is sometimes known as the waterfall model which involves a sequence of steps across various systems and players publishers and data management platforms user data ad servers and their delivery data inventory management systems ad traders and ad exchanges 91 27 93 there are various issues with this system including lack of transparency for advertisers unverifiable metrics lack of control over ad venues audience tracking and privacy concerns 91 27 93 internet users who dislike ads have adopted counter measures such as ad blocking technologies which allow users to automatically filter unwanted advertising from websites and some internet applications in 2017 24 of australian internet users had ad blockers 91 28 93 health edit deep learning ai image models are being used for reviewing x rays and detecting the eye condition macular degeneration social services edit governments have been implementing digital technologies to provide more efficient administration and social services since the early 2000s often referred to as e government many governments around the world are now using automated algorithmic systems for profiling and targeting policies and services including algorithmic policing based on risks surveillance sorting of people such as airport screening providing services based on risk profiles in child protection providing employment services and governing the unemployed 91 29 93 a significant application of adm in social services relates to the use of predictive analytics eg predictions of risks to children from abuse neglect in child protection predictions of recidivism or crime in policing and criminal justice predictions of welfare tax fraud in compliance systems predictions of long term unemployment in employment services historically these systems were based on standard statistical analyses however from the early 2000s machine learning has increasingly been developed and deployed key issues with the use of adm in social services include bias fairness accountability and explainability which refers to transparency around the reasons for a decision and the ability to explain the basis on which a machine made a decision 91 29 93 for example australia s federal social security delivery agency centrelink developed and implemented an automated processes for detecting and collecting debt which led to many cases of wrongful debt collection in what became known as the robodebt scheme 91 30 93 transport and mobility edit connected and automated mobility cam involves autonomous vehicles such as self driving cars and other forms of transport which use automated decision making systems to replace various aspects of human control of the vehicle 91 31 93 this can range from level 0 complete human driving to level 5 completely autonomous 91 2 93 at level 5 the machine is able to make decisions to control the vehicle based on data models and geospatial mapping and real time sensors and processing of the environment cars with levels 1 to 3 are already available on the market in 2021 in 2016 the german government established an ethics commission on automated and connected driving which recommended connected and automated vehicles cavs be developed if the systems cause fewer accidents than human drivers positive balance of risk it also provided 20 ethical rules for the adaptation of automated and connected driving 91 32 93 in 2020 the european commission strategy on cams recommended that they be adopted in europe to reduce road fatalities and lower emissions however self driving cars also raise many policy security and legal issues in terms of liability and ethical decision making in the case of accidents as well as privacy issues 91 31 93 issues of trust in autonomous vehicles and community concerns about their safety are key factors to be addressed if avs are to be widely adopted 91 33 93 surveillance edit automated digital data collections via sensors cameras online transactions and social media have significantly expanded the scope scale and goals of surveillance practices and institutions in government and commercial sectors 91 34 93 as a result there has been a major shift from targeted monitoring of suspects to the ability to monitor entire populations 91 35 93 the level of surveillance now possible as a result of automated data collection has been described as surveillance capitalism or surveillance economy to indicate the way digital media involves large scale tracking and accumulation of data on every interaction ethical and legal issues edit there are many social ethical and legal implications of automated decision making systems concerns raised include lack of transparency and contestability of decisions incursions on privacy and surveillance exacerbating systemic bias and inequality due to data and algorithmic bias intellectual property rights the spread of misinformation via media platforms administrative discrimination risk and responsibility unemployment and many others 91 36 93 91 37 93 as adm becomes more ubiquitous there is greater need to address the ethical challenges to ensure good governance in information societies 91 38 93 adm systems are often based on machine learning and algorithms which are not easily able to be viewed or analysed leading to concerns that they are black box systems which are not transparent or accountable 91 2 93 a report from citizen lab in canada argues for a critical human rights analysis of the application of adm in various areas to ensure the use of automated decision making does not result in infringements on rights including the rights to equality and non discrimination freedom of movement expression religion and association privacy rights and the rights to life liberty and security of the person 91 25 93 legislative responses to adm include the european general data protection regulation gdpr introduced in 2016 is a regulation in eu law on data protection and privacy in the european union eu article 22 1 enshrines the right of data subjects not to be subject to decisions which have legal or other significant effects being based solely on automatic individual decision making 91 39 93 91 40 93 gdpr also includes some rules on the right to explanation however the exact scope and nature of these is currently subject to pending review by the court of justice of the european union 91 41 93 these provisions were not first introduced in the gdpr but have been present in a similar form across europe since the data protection directive in 1995 and the 1978 french law the loi informatique et libert s 160 91 fr 93 91 42 93 similarly scoped and worded provisions with varying attached rights and obligations are present in the data protection laws of many other jurisdictions across the world including uganda morocco and the us state of virginia 91 43 93 rights for the explanation of public sector automated decisions forming algorithmic treatment under the french loi pour une r publique num rique 91 42 93 bias edit adm may incorporate algorithmic bias arising from data sources where data inputs are biased in their collection or selection 91 37 93 technical design of the algorithm for example where assumptions have been made about how a person will behave 91 44 93 emergent bias where the application of adm in unanticipated circumstances creates a biased outcome 91 44 93 explainability edit questions of biased or incorrect data or algorithms and concerns that some adms are black box technologies closed to human scrutiny or interrogation has led to what is referred to as the issue of explainability or the right to an explanation of automated decisions and ai this is also known as explainable ai xai or interpretable ai in which the results of the solution can be analysed and understood by humans xai algorithms are considered to follow three principles transparency interpretability and explainability information asymmetry edit automated decision making may increase the information asymmetry between individuals whose data feeds into the system and the platforms and decision making systems capable of inferring information from that data on the other hand it has been observed that in financial trading the information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents may be much less than between two human agents or between human and machine agents 91 45 93 research fields edit many academic disciplines and fields are increasingly turning their attention to the development application and implications of adm including business computer sciences human computer interaction hci law public administration and media and communications the automation of media content and algorithmically driven news video and other content via search systems and platforms is a major focus of academic research in media studies 91 27 93 the acm conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct was established in 2018 to study transparency and explainability in the context of socio technical systems many of which include adm and ai key research centres investigating adm include algorithm watch
