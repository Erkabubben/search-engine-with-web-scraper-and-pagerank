artificial intelligence in fiction from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search artificial intelligence as depicted in works of fiction artificial intelligence is a recurrent theme in science fiction whether utopian emphasising the potential benefits or dystopian emphasising the dangers the notion of machines with human like intelligence dates back at least to samuel butler s 1872 novel erewhon since then many science fiction stories have presented different effects of creating such intelligence often involving rebellions by robots among the best known of these are stanley kubrick s 1968 2001 a space odyssey with its murderous onboard computer hal 9000 contrasting with the more benign r2 d2 in the 1977 star wars and the eponymous robot in the 2008 wall e scientists and engineers have noted the implausibility of many science fiction scenarios but have mentioned fictional robots many times in artificial intelligence research articles most often in a

didrachm coin depicting the winged talos an automaton or artificial being in ancient greek myth c 300 bc the notion of advanced robots with human like intelligence dates back at least to samuel butler s 1872 novel erewhon 91 1 93 91 2 93 this drew on an earlier 1863 article of his darwin among the machines where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species 91 3 93 91 2 93 similar ideas were also discussed by others around the same time as butler including george eliot in a chapter of her final published work impressions of theophrastus such 1879 91 2 93 the creature in mary shelley s 1818 frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being for instance by the science fiction author brian aldiss 91 4 93 beings with at least some appearance of intelligence were imagined too in classical antiquity 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 utopian and dystopian visions edit artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals 91 8 93 it is a recurrent theme in science fiction scholars have divided it into utopian emphasising the potential benefits and dystopian emphasising the dangers 91 9 93 91 10 93 91 11 93 utopian edit brent spiner portrayed the benevolent ai data in star trek the next generation optimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction 91 12 93 benign ai characters include robby in lost in space from 1965 to 1968 data in star trek the next generation from 1987 to 1994 and wall e in 2008 91 13 93 91 11 93 iain banks s culture series of novels portrays a utopian post scarcity space society of humanoids aliens and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialist habitats across the milky way 91 14 93 91 15 93 researchers at the university of cambridge have identified four major themes in utopian scenarios featuring ai immortality or indefinite lifespans ease or freedom from the need to work gratification or pleasure and entertainment provided by machines and dominance the power to protect oneself or rule over others 91 16 93 alexander wiegel contrasts the role of ai in 2001 a space odyssey and in duncan jones s 2009 film moon whereas in 1968 wiegel argues the public felt technology paranoia and the ai computer hal was portrayed as a cold hearted killer by 2009 the public were far more familiar with ai and the film s gerty is the quiet savior who enables the protagonists to succeed and who sacrifices itself for their safety 91 17 93 dystopian edit further information apocalyptic and post apocalyptic fiction the researcher duncan lucas writes in 2002 that humans are worried about the technology they are constructing and that as machines started to approach intellect and thought that concern becomes acute he calls the early 20th century dystopian view of ai in fiction the animated automaton naming as examples the 1931 film frankenstein the 1927 metropolis and the 1920 play r u r 91 18 93 a later 20th century approach he names heuristic hardware giving as instances 2001 a space odyssey do androids dream of electric sheep the hitch hiker s guide to the galaxy and i robot 91 19 93 lucas considers also the films that illustrate the effect of the personal computer on science fiction from 1980 onwards with the blurring of the boundary between the real and the virtual in what he calls the cyborg effect he cites as examples neuromancer the matrix the diamond age and terminator 91 20 93 the film director ridley scott has focused on ai throughout his career and it plays an important part in his films prometheus blade runner and the alien franchise 91 21 93 frankenstein complex edit a common portrayal of ai in science fiction and one of the oldest is the frankenstein complex a term coined by asimov where a robot turns on its creator 91 22 93 fictional ai is notorious for extreme malicious compliance for instance in the 2015 film ex machina the intelligent entity ava turns on its creator as well as on its potential rescuer 91 23 93 ai rebellion edit see also ai takeovers in popular culture robots revolt in karel apek s 1920 science fiction play r u r among the many possible dystopian scenarios involving artificial intelligence robots may usurp control over civilization from humans forcing them into submission hiding or extinction 91 15 93 in tales of ai rebellion the worst of all scenarios happens as the intelligent entities created by humanity become self aware reject human authority and attempt to destroy mankind one of the earliest examples is in the 1920 play r u r by karel apek a race of self replicating robot slaves revolt against their human masters 91 24 93 91 25 93 another early instance is in the 1934 film master of the world where the war robot kills its own inventor 91 26 93 hal 9000 is the lethal onboard computer of 2001 a space odyssey many science fiction rebellion stories followed one of the best known being stanley kubrick s 1968 film 2001 a space odyssey in which the artificially intelligent onboard computer hal 9000 lethally malfunctions on a space mission and kills the entire crew except the spaceship s commander who manages to deactivate it 91 27 93 in his 1967 hugo award winning short story i have no mouth and i must scream harlan ellison presents the possibility that a sentient computer named allied mastercomputer or am in the story will be as unhappy and dissatisfied with its boring endless existence as its human creators would have been am becomes enraged enough to take it out on the few humans left whom he sees as directly responsible for his own boredom anger and unhappiness 91 28 93 alternatively as in william gibson s 1984 cyberpunk novel neuromancer the intelligent beings may simply not care about humans 91 15 93 ai controlled societies edit the motive behind the ai revolution is often more than the simple quest for power or a superiority complex robots may revolt to become the guardian of humanity alternatively humanity may intentionally relinquish some control fearful of its own destructive nature an early example is jack williamson s 1947 novelette with folded hands in which a race of humanoid robots in the name of their prime directive to serve and obey and guard men from harm essentially assume control of every aspect of human life no humans may engage in any behavior that might endanger them and every human action is scrutinized carefully humans who resist the prime directive are taken away and lobotomized so they may be happy under the new mechanoids rule 91 29 93 though still under human authority isaac asimov s zeroth law of the three laws of robotics similarly implied a benevolent guidance by robots 91 30 93 human dominance edit in other scenarios humanity is able to keep control over the earth whether by banning ai by designing robots to be submissive as in asimov s works or by having humans merge with robots the science fiction novelist frank herbert explored the idea of a time when mankind might ban artificial intelligence and in some interpretations even all forms of computing technology including integrated circuits entirely his dune series mentions a rebellion called the butlerian jihad in which mankind defeats the smart machines and imposes a death penalty for recreating them quoting from the fictional orange catholic bible thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind in the dune novels published after his death hunters of dune sandworms of dune a renegade ai overmind returns to eradicate mankind as vengeance for the butlerian jihad 91 31 93 in some stories humanity remains in authority over robots often the robots are programmed specifically to remain in service to society as in isaac asimov s three laws of robotics 91 30 93 in the alien films not only is the control system of the nostromo spaceship somewhat intelligent the crew call it mother but there are also androids in the society which are called synthetics or artificial persons that are such perfect imitations of humans that they are not discriminated against 91 21 93 91 32 93 tars and case from interstellar similarly demonstrate simulated human emotions and humour while continuing to acknowledge their expendability 91 33 93 simulated reality edit main article simulation hypothesis simulated reality has become a common theme in science fiction as seen in the 1999 film the matrix which depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots enslave humanity within a simulation which is set in the contemporary world 91 34 93 gender metaphor edit in the stepford wives 1975 film the main character joanna eberhart moves to a new town stepford where all the wives seem impeccable and obey their husbands in truth they are being replaced by robotic doppelgangers of themselves the story of the stepford wives draws from the concept of the feminine mystique a term coined by betty friedan this film acts as a metaphor of this term portrayed through the wives the wives as cyborgs themselves act as obedient passive servants with no interests or passions except homemaking taking the humanity out of them they are killed 91 35 93 91 page 160 needed 93 as seen by engineers and scientists edit implausibility edit engineers and scientists have taken an interest in the way ai is presented in fiction in films like the 2014 ex machina or 2015 chappie a single isolated genius becomes the first to successfully build an artificial general intelligence scientists in the real world deem this to be unlikely in chappie transcendence and tron human minds are capable of being uploaded into artificial or virtual bodies usually no reasonable explanation is offered as to how this difficult task can be achieved in the i robot and bicentennial man films robots that are programmed to serve humans spontaneously generate new goals on their own without a plausible explanation of how this took place 91 36 93 analysing ian mcdonald s 2004 river of gods krzysztof solarewicz identifies the ways that it depicts ais including independence and unexpectedness political awkwardness openness to the alien and the occidental value of authenticity 91 37 93 types of mention edit some fictional robots such as r2 d2 have been seen as utopian making them popular with engineers and others 91 38 93 in 2015 all nippon airways unveiled this boeing 787 9 in r2 d2 livery omar mubin and colleagues have analysed the engineering mentions of the top 21 fictional robots based on those in the carnegie mellon university hall of fame and the imdb list wall e had 20 mentions followed by hal 9000 with 15 91 a 93 star wars s r2 d2 with 13 and data with 12 the terminator t 800 received only 2 of the total of 121 engineering mentions 60 were utopian 40 neutral and 21 dystopian hal 9000 and skynet received both utopian and dystopian mentions for instance hal 9000 is seen as dystopian in one paper because its designers failed to prioritize its goals properly 91 40 93 but as utopian in another where a real system s conversational chat bot interface lacks a hal 9000 level of intelligence and there is ambiguity in how the computer interprets what the human is trying to convey 91 41 93 utopian mentions often of wall e were associated with the goal of improving communication to readers and to a lesser extent with inspiration to authors wall e was mentioned more often than any other robot for emotions followed by hal 9000 voice speech followed by hal 9000 and r2 d2 for physical gestures and for personality skynet was the robot most often mentioned for intelligence followed by hal 9000 and data 91 38 93 mubin and colleagues believed that scientists and engineers avoided dystopian mentions of robots possibly out of a reluctance driven by trepidation or simply a lack of awareness 91 42 93 see also edit biology in fiction darwin among the machines machine rule simulated consciousness science fiction list of artificial intelligence films notes edit mubin and colleagues noted that the orthography of robot names caused them difficulties thus hal 9000 was also written hal hal9000 and hal 9000 and similarly for other robots so they believed their search was likely incomplete 91 39 93
