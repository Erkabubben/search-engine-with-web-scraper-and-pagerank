the intellectual capability of humans which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self awareness 91 1 93 high intelligence is associated with better outcomes in life 91 2 93 through intelligence humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn form concepts understand apply logic and reason including the capacities to recognize patterns plan innovate solve problems make decisions retain information and use language to communicate there are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual s mindset and efforts 91 3 93 several subcategories of intelligence such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence 91 4 93 91 5 93 they are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected 91 4 93 91 5 93 contents 1 history 2 correlates 3 theories 3 1 relevance of iq tests 3 2 theory of multiple intelligences 3 3 triarchic theory of

to be one of the most useful concepts in psychology because it correlates with many relevant variables for instance the probability of suffering an accident salary and more 91 6 93 education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence education appears to be the most consistent robust and durable method known for raising intelligence 91 7 93 myopia a number of studies have shown a correlation between iq and myopia 91 8 93 some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental whereby people with a higher iq are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading or the other way around whereby people who read more are more likely to reach a higher iq while others contend that a genetic link exists 91 9 93 aging there is evidence that aging causes a decline in cognitive functions in one cross sectional study various cognitive functions measured declines by about 0 8 in z score from age 20 to age 50 the cognitive functions included speed of processing working memory and long term memory 91 10 93 genes a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in human dna are correlated with intelligence 91 11 93 91 12 93 motivation motivation is a factor that influences the results of the iq test people with higher motivation tend to obtain higher iq scores 91 13 93 theories edit relevance of iq tests edit further information 160 insufficiency of measurement via iq in psychology human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests however while iq test scores show a high degree of inter test reliability and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence 91 16 93 according to psychologist wayne weiten iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense the validity of iq tests is questionable 91 16 93 theory of multiple intelligences edit main article theory of multiple intelligences howard gardner s theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies not only of normal children and adults but also of gifted individuals including so called savants of persons who have suffered brain damage of experts and virtuosos and of individuals from diverse cultures gardner breaks intelligence down into at least a number of different components in the first edition of his book frames of mind 1983 he described seven distinct types of intelligence logical mathematical linguistic spatial musical kinesthetic interpersonal and intrapersonal in a second edition of this book he added two more types of intelligence naturalist and existential intelligences he argues that psychometric iq tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence 91 17 93 a major criticism of gardner s theory is that it has never been tested or subjected to peer review by gardner or anyone else and indeed that it is unfalsifiable 91 18 93 others e g locke 2005 have suggested that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence specific aptitude theory implies a political rather than scientific agenda intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities schmidt and hunter 2004 suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability or g has not received empirical support on the other hand jerome bruner agreed with gardner that the intelligences were useful fictions and went on to state that his approach is so far beyond the data crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered 91 19 93 triarchic theory of intelligence edit main article triarchic theory of intelligence robert sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability 91 20 93 the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly but not entirely novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to selection of and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor instead the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood more recently the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed as the theory of successful intelligence by sternberg 91 21 93 91 22 93 intelligence is now defined as an individual s assessment of success in life by the individual s own idiographic standards and within the individual s sociocultural context success is achieved by using combinations of analytical creative and practical intelligence the three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills the processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence adapting to shaping of and selecting of one s environments the mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one s strengths and compensating or correcting for one s weaknesses sternberg s theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community 91 23 93 91 24 93 91 25 93 91 26 93 pass theory of intelligence edit main article pass theory of intelligence based on a r luria s 1966 91 27 93 seminal work on the modularization of brain function and supported by decades of neuroimaging research the pass theory of intelligence 91 28 93 planning attention simultaneous successive proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes the first process is the planning which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior selecting and constructing strategies and monitoring performance the second is the attention process which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli the next two are called simultaneous and successive processing and they involve encoding transforming and retaining information simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required examples of this include recognizing figures such as a triangle within a circle vs a circle within a triangle or the difference between he had a shower before breakfast and he had breakfast before a shower successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented these four processes are functions of four areas of the brain planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains the frontal lobe attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well simultaneous processing and successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal temporal lobes the pass theory is heavily indebted to both luria 1966 91 27 93 1973 91 29 93 and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence 91 30 93 piaget s theory and neo piagetian theories edit main articles piaget s theory of cognitive development and neo piagetian theories of cognitive development in piaget s theory of cognitive development the focus is not on mental abilities but rather on a child s mental models of the world as a child develops increasingly more accurate models of the world are developed which enable the child to interact with the world better one example being object permanence where the child develops a model where objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen heard or touched piaget s theory described four main stages and many sub stages in the development these four main stages are sensorimotor stage birth 2yrs pre operational stage 2yrs 7rs concrete operational stage 7rs 11yrs and formal operations stage 11yrs 16yrs 91 31 93 degree of progress through these stages are correlated but not identical with psychometric iq 91 32 93 91 33 93 piaget conceptualizes intelligence as an activity more than a capacity one of piaget s most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old and four and a half years old he began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets one with the sweets in a line spread further apart and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together he found that children between 2 years 6 months old and 3 years 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows between 3 years 2 months and 4 years 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have more after 4 years 6 months they again discriminate correctly 91 34 93 initially younger children were not studied because if at the age of four years a child could not conserve quantity then a younger child presumably could not either the results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation but as they get older they lose this quality and do not recover it until four and a half years old this attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy or because of the inability for a four year old to reverse situations 91 31 93 by the end of this experiment several results were found first younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged this study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations depending on how logical the structure of the task is research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result the child will count the sweets to decide which has more finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans native inheritance 91 31 93 piaget s theory has been criticized for the age of appearance of a new model of the world such as object permanence being dependent on how the testing is done see the article on object permanence more generally the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing 91 35 93 neo piagetian theories of cognitive development expand piaget s theory in various ways such as also considering psychometric like factors such as processing speed and working memory hypercognitive factors like self monitoring more stages and more consideration on how progress may vary in different domains such as spatial or social 91 36 93 91 37 93 parieto frontal integration theory of intelligence edit main article parieto frontal integration theory based on a review of 37 neuroimaging studies jung and haier 2007 proposed that the biological basis of intelligence stems from how well the frontal and parietal regions of the brain communicate and exchange information with each other 91 38 93 subsequent neuroimaging and lesion studies report general consensus with the theory 91 39 93 91 40 93 91 41 93 a review of the neuroscience and intelligence literature concludes that the parieto frontal integration theory is the best available explanation for human intelligence differences 91 42 93 investment theory edit based on the cattell horn carroll theory the tests of intelligence most often used in the relevant studies include measures of fluid ability gf and crystallized ability gc that differ in their trajectory of development in individuals 91 43 93 the investment theory by cattell 91 44 93 states that the individual differences observed in the procurement of skills and knowledge gc are partially attributed to the investment of gf thus suggesting the involvement of fluid intelligence in every aspect of the learning process 91 45 93 it is essential to highlight that the investment theory suggests that personality traits affect actual ability and not scores on an iq test 91 46 93 in association hebb s theory of intelligence suggested a bifurcation as well intelligence a physiological that could be seen as a semblance of fluid intelligence and intelligence b experiential similar to crystallized intelligence 91 47 93 intelligence compensation theory ict edit the intelligence compensation theory a term first coined by wood and englert 2009 91 48 93 states that individuals who are comparatively less intelligent work harder more methodically become more resolute and thorough more conscientious in order to achieve goals to compensate for their lack of intelligence whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traits behaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort 91 49 93 91 50 93 the theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness such that the development of the personality trait conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence this assumption is deemed plausible as it is unlikely that the reverse causal relationship could occur 91 51 93 implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence gf and conscientiousness the justification being the timeline of development of gf gc and personality as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop subsequently during school going ages more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence knowledge through education as they would be more efficient thorough hard working and dutiful 91 52 93 this theory has recently been contradicted by evidence that identifies compensatory sample selection thus attributing the previous findings to the bias in selecting samples with individuals above a certain threshold of achievement 91 53 93 bandura s theory of self efficacy and cognition edit the view of cognitive ability has evolved over the years and it is no longer viewed as a fixed property held by an individual instead the current perspective describes it as a general capacity comprising not only cognitive but motivational social and behavioural aspects as well these facets work together to perform numerous tasks an essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions and aversive experiences that can compromise one s quality of thought and activity the link between intelligence and success has been bridged by crediting individual differences in self efficacy bandura s theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations thus the theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly averagely or excellently based on differences in self efficacy a key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively these skills are dependent on processing of stimuli that is unclear and ambiguous to learn the relevant concepts individuals must be able to rely on the reserve of knowledge to identify develop and execute options they must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences thus a stable sense of self efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations 91 54 93 to summarize bandura s theory of self efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self efficacy in any field will avoid challenges this effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as personal threats when failure occurs they recover from it more slowly than others and credit it to an insufficient aptitude on the other hand persons with high levels of self efficacy hold a task diagnostic aim that leads to effective performance 91 55 93 process personality intelligence and knowledge theory ppik edit this section needs expansion 32 with more extensive and clear explanations you can help by adding to it march 2018 predicted growth curves for intelligence as process crystallized intelligence occupational knowledge and avocational knowledge based on ackerman s ppik theory 91 citation needed 93 developed by ackerman the ppik process personality intelligence and knowledge theory further develops the approach on intelligence as proposed by cattell the investment theory and hebb suggesting a distinction between intelligence as knowledge and intelligence as process two concepts that are comparable and related to gc and gf respectively but broader and closer to hebb s notions of intelligence a and intelligence b and integrating these factors with elements such as personality motivation and interests 91 56 93 91 57 93 ackerman describes the difficulty of distinguishing process from knowledge as content cannot be eliminated from any ability test 91 56 93 91 57 93 91 58 93 personality traits have not shown to be significantly correlated with the intelligence as process aspect except in the context of psychopathology one exception to this generalization has been the finding of sex differences in cognitive abilities specifically abilities in mathematical and spatial form 91 56 93 91 59 93 on the other hand the intelligence as knowledge factor has been associated with personality traits of openness and typical intellectual engagement 91 56 93 91 60 93 91 61 93 which also strongly correlate with verbal abilities associated with crystallized intelligence 91 56 93 latent inhibition edit main article latent

and mental health impact on cognition edit there is research and development about the cognitive impacts of smartphones and digital technology a group reported that contrary to widespread belief scientific evidence doesn t show that these technologies harm biological cognitive abilities and that they instead only change predominant ways of cognition such as a reduced need to remember facts or conduct mathematical calculations by pen and paper outside contemporary schools however some activities like reading novels that require long focused attention spans and don t feature ongoing rewarding stimulation may become more challenging in general 91 74 93 91 75 93 how extensive online media usage impacts cognitive development in youth is under investigation 91 76 93 and impacts may substantially vary by the way and which technologies are being used such as which and how digital media platforms are being used and how these are designed impacts may vary to a degree such studies have not yet taken into account and may be modulatable by the design choice and use of technologies and platforms including by the users themselves measured results of the study a study suggests that in children aged 8 12 during two years time digital gaming or watching digital videos can be positively correlated with measures intelligence albeit correlations with overall screen time including social media socializing and tv were not investigated and time gaming did not differentiate between categories of video games e g shares of games platform and genre and digital videos did not differentiate between categories of videos 91 77 93 91 78 93 brain training edit attempts to raise iq with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks for instance working memory but it is yet unclear if these increases generalize to increased intelligence per se 91 79 93 91 80 93 a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n back task can increase fluid intelligence gf as measured in several different standard tests 91 81 93 this finding received some attention from popular media including an article in wired 91 82 93 however a subsequent criticism of the paper s methodology questioned the experiment s validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups 91 83 93 for example the progressive nature of raven s advanced progressive matrices apm test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions i e 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45 minute test philosophy edit on the philosophical front conscious efforts to influence intelligence raise ethical issues neuroethics considers the ethical legal and social implications of neuroscience and deals

ethics of human genetic engineering transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes eugenics is a social philosophy which advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention 91 84 93 eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii 91 85 93 measuring edit main article intelligence quotient further information psychometrics score distribution chart for sample of 905 children tested on 1916 stanford binet test the approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing it is also by far the most widely used in practical settings 91 17 93 intelligence quotient iq tests include the stanford binet raven s progressive matrices the wechsler adult intelligence scale and the kaufman assessment battery for children there are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude in the united states examples include the ssat the sat the act the gre the mcat the lsat and the gmat 91 17 93 regardless of the method used almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normally distributed in the general population 91 86 93 91 87 93 intelligence tests are widely used in educational 91 88 93 business and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior iq and g discussed in the next section are correlated with many important social outcomes individuals with low iqs are more likely to be divorced have a child out of marriage be incarcerated and need long term welfare support while individuals with high iqs are associated with more years of education higher status jobs and higher income 91 89 93 intelligence as measured by psychometric tests has been found to be highly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes e g adaptive performance 91 90 93 91 91 93 91 92 93 and iq g is the single best predictor of successful job performance however some researchers although largely concurring with this finding have advised caution in citing the strength of the claim due to a number of factors these include statistical assumptions imposed underlying some of these studies studies done prior to 1970 which appear inconsistent with more recent studies and ongoing debates within the psychology literature as to the validity of current iq measurement tools 91 93 93 91 94 93 general intelligence factor or g edit main article g factor psychometrics there are many different kinds of iq tests using a wide variety of test tasks some tests consist of a single type of task others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents visual spatial 91 95 93 verbal numerical and asking for different cognitive processes e g reasoning memory rapid decisions visual comparisons spatial imagery reading and retrieval of general knowledge the psychologist charles spearman early in the 20th century carried out the first formal factor analysis of correlations between various test tasks he found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other which is called a positive manifold spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests spearman named it g for general intelligence factor he interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that to a larger or smaller degree influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold this interpretation of g as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics although an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der maas and colleagues 91 96 93 their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests these mechanisms support each other so that efficient operation of one of them makes efficient operation of the others more likely thereby creating the positive manifold iq tests can be ranked by how highly they load on the g factor tests with high g loadings are those that correlate highly with most other tests one comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks 91 97 93 has found that the raven s progressive matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks the raven s is a test of inductive reasoning with abstract visual material it consists of a series of problems sorted approximately by increasing difficulty each problem presents a 3 x 3 matrix of abstract designs with one empty cell the matrix is constructed according to a rule and the person must find out the rule to determine which of 8 alternatives fits into the empty cell because of its high correlation with other tests the raven s progressive matrices are generally acknowledged as a good indicator of general intelligence this is problematic however because there are substantial gender differences on the raven s 91 98 93 which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests 91 99 93 general collective intelligence factor or c edit main article collective intelligence a recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence defined as a group s general ability to perform a wide range of tasks 91 100 93 expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups definition operationalization and methods are similar to the psychometric approach of general individual intelligence where an individual s performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure intelligence indicated by the general intelligence factor g extracted via factor analysis 91 101 93 in the same vein collective intelligence research aims to discover a c factor explaining between group differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it 91 102 93 historical psychometric theories edit main article intelligence quotient 160 history several different theories of intelligence have historically been important for psychometrics often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in g factor cattell horn carroll theory edit main article cattell horn carroll theory many of the broad recent iq tests have been greatly influenced by the cattell horn carroll theory it is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research a hierarchy of factors for human intelligence is used g is at the top under it there are 10 broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into 70 narrow abilities the broad abilities are 91 103 93 fluid intelligence gf includes the broad ability to reason form concepts and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures crystallized intelligence gc includes the breadth and depth of a person s acquired knowledge the ability to communicate one s knowledge and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures quantitative reasoning gq the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols reading amp writing ability grw includes basic reading and writing skills short term memory gsm is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness and then use it within a few seconds long term storage and retrieval glr is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking visual processing gv is the ability to perceive analyze synthesize and think with visual patterns including the ability to store and recall visual representations auditory processing ga is the ability to analyze synthesize and discriminate auditory stimuli including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions processing speed gs is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention decision reaction time speed gt reflect the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds not to be confused with gs which typically is measured in intervals of 2 3 minutes see mental chronometry modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities for example gq and grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not iq 91 103 93 gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment g was earlier often subdivided into only gf and gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular wechsler iq test more recent research has shown the situation to be more complex 91 103 93 controversies edit while not necessarily a dispute about the psychometric approach itself there are several controversies regarding the results from psychometric research one criticism has been against the early research such as craniometry 91 104 93 a reply has been that drawing conclusions from early intelligence research is like condemning the auto industry by criticizing the performance of the model t 91 105 93 several critics such as stephen jay gould have been critical of g seeing it as a statistical artifact and that iq tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities 91 104 93 91 106 93 the american psychological association s report intelligence knowns and unknowns stated that iq tests do correlate and that the view that g is a statistical artifact is a minority one insufficiency of measurement via iq edit this section is an excerpt from intelligence quotient validity as a measure of intelligence edit reliability and validity are very different concepts while reliability reflects reproducibility validity refers to whether the test measures what it purports to measure 91 107 93 while iq tests are generally considered to measure some forms of intelligence they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of for example creativity and social intelligence for this reason psychologist wayne weiten argues that their construct validity must be carefully qualified and not be overstated 91 107 93 according to weiten iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense the validity of iq tests is questionable 91 107 93 some scientists have disputed the value of iq as a measure of intelligence altogether in the mismeasure of man 1981 expanded edition 1996 evolutionary biologist stephen jay gould compared iq testing with the now discredited practice of determining intelligence via craniometry arguing that both are based on the fallacy of reification our tendency to convert abstract concepts into entities 91 108 93 gould s argument sparked a great deal of debate 91 109 93 91 110 93 and the book is listed as one of discover magazine 39 s 25 greatest science books of all time 91 111 93 along these same lines critics such as keith stanovich do not dispute the capacity of iq test scores to predict some kinds of achievement but argue that basing a concept of intelligence on iq test scores alone neglects other important aspects of mental ability 91 112 93 91 113 93 robert sternberg another significant critic of iq as the main measure of human cognitive abilities argued that reducing the concept of intelligence to the measure of g does not fully account for the different skills and knowledge types that produce success in human society 91 114 93 despite these objections clinical psychologists generally regard iq scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes 91 specify 93 91 115 93 91 116 93 a study suggested that intelligence is composed of distinct cognitive systems each of which having its own capacity and being to some degree independent of other components with the cognitive

unique to the culture that one is studying robert sternberg is among the researchers who have discussed how one s culture affects the person s interpretation of intelligence and he further believes that to define intelligence in only one way without considering different meanings in cultural contexts may cast an investigative and unintentionally egocentric view on the world to negate this psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life according to one s own definition of success within one s sociocultural context analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence s components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems creative intelligence is the result of intelligence s components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations practical intelligence is the result of intelligence s components applied to experience for purposes of adaption shaping and selection 91 129 93 although typically identified by its western definition multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world in many eastern cultures intelligence is mainly related with one s social roles and responsibilities a chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in china in several african communities intelligence is shown similarly through a social lens however rather than through social roles as in many eastern cultures it is exemplified through social responsibilities for example in the language of chi chewa which is spoken by some ten million people across central africa the equivalent term for intelligence implies not only cleverness but also the ability to take on responsibility furthermore within american culture there are a variety of interpretations of intelligence present as well one of the most common views on intelligence within american societies defines it as a combination of problem solving skills deductive reasoning skills and intelligence quotient iq while other american societies point out that intelligent people should have a social conscience accept others for who they are and be able to give advice or wisdom 91 130 93 see also edit evolution
