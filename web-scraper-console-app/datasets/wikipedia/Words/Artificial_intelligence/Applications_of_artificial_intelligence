deepdream algorithm had their art showcased at the 2016 google sponsored benefit and auction in san francisco understanding art with ai edit in addition to the creation of original art research methods that utilize ai have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections this has been made possible due to large scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades although the main goal of digitization was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections the use of ai in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives 91 276 93 two computational methods close reading and distant viewing are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art 91 277 93 close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties in contrast through distant viewing methods the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification object detection multimodal tasks knowledge discovery in art history and computational aesthetics 91 276 93 whereas distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections close reading involves one piece of artwork researchers have also
