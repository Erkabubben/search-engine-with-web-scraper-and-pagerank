is derived from the verb dr ssomai i grasp 91 n 3 93 it is believed that the same word with the meaning of handful or handle is found in linear b tablets of the mycenean pylos 91 3 93 91 n 4 93 initially a drachma was a fistful a grasp of six obolo or obelo metal sticks literally spits used as a form of currency as early as 1100 160 bc and being a form of bullion bronze copper or iron ingots denominated by weight a hoard of over 150 rod shaped obeloi was uncovered at heraion of argos in peloponnese six of them are displayed at the numismatic museum of athens it was the standard unit of silver coinage at most ancient greek mints and the name obol was used to describe a coin that was one sixth of a drachma the notion that drachma derived from the word for fistful was recorded by herakleides of pontos 387 312 160 bc who was informed by the priests of heraion that pheidon king of argos dedicated rod shaped obeloi to heraion similar information about pheidon s obeloi was also recorded at the parian chronicle ancient greek coins normally had distinctive names in daily use the athenian tetradrachm was called owl 91 6 93 the aeginetic stater was called chelone the corinthian stater was called hippos horse and so on each city would mint its own and have them stamped with recognizable symbols of the city known as badge in numismatics along with suitable inscriptions and they would often be referred to either by the name of the city or of the image depicted the exact exchange value of each was determined by the quantity and quality of the metal which reflected on the reputation of each mint among the greek cities that used the drachma were abdera abydos alexandria aetna antioch athens chios cyzicus corinth ephesus eretria gela catana kos maronia naxos pella pergamum rhegion salamis smyrni sparta syracuse tarsus thasos tenedos troy and more the 5th century bc athenian tetradrachm four drachmae coin was perhaps the most widely used coin in the greek world prior to the time of alexander the great along with the corinthian stater it featured the helmeted profile bust of athena on the obverse front and an owl on the reverse back in daily use they were called glaukes owls 91 7 93 hence the proverb an owl to athens referring to something that was in plentiful supply like coals to newcastle the reverse is featured on the national side of the modern greek 1 euro coin drachmae were minted on different weight standards at different greek mints the standard that came to be most commonly used was the athenian or attic one which weighed a little over 4 3 160 grams after alexander s conquests the name drachma was used in many of the hellenistic kingdoms in the middle east including the ptolemaic kingdom in alexandria and the parthian empire based in what is modern day iran the arabic unit of currency known as dirham arabic known from pre islamic times and afterwards inherited its name from the drachma or didrachm 2 drachmae the dirham is still the name of the official currencies of morocco and the united arab emirates the armenian dram armenian also derives its name from the drachma value edit it is difficult to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today which makes purchasing power parity ppp calculations very difficult however some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century bc a drachma had a rough value of 25 u s dollars in the year 1990 equivalent to us 46 50 in 2015 91 8 93 whereas classical historians regularly say that in the heyday of ancient greece the fifth and fourth centuries the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite 91 9 93 was one drachma and for a heliast juror half a drachma since 425 160 bc 91 10 93 modern commentators derived from xenophon 91 11 93 that half a drachma per day 360 days per year would provide a comfortable subsistence for the poor citizens for the head of a household in 355 160 bc earlier in 422 160 bc we also see in aristophanes wasps line 300 302 that the daily half drachma of a juror is just enough for the daily subsistence of a family of three a modern person might think of one drachma as the rough equivalent of a skilled worker s daily pay in the place where they live which could be as low as us 1 or as high as 100 depending on the country fractions and multiples of the drachma were minted by many states most notably in ptolemaic egypt which minted large coins in gold silver and bronze notable ptolemaic coins included the gold pentadrachm and octadrachm and silver tetradrachm decadrachm and pentakaidecadrachm this was especially noteworthy as it would not be until the introduction of the guldengroschen in 1486 that coins of substantial size particularly in silver would be minted in significant quantities for the roman successors of the drachma see roman provincial coins denominations of ancient greek drachma edit the weight of the silver drachma was approximately 4 3 grams or 0 15 ounces 91 12 93 although weights varied significantly from one city state to another it was divided into six obols of
