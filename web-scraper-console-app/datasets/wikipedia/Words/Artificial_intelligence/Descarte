february 1650 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 58 8202 58 8202 was a french philosopher scientist and mathematician widely considered a seminal figure in the emergence of modern philosophy and science mathematics was central to his method of inquiry and he connected the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra into analytic geometry descartes spent much of his working life in the dutch republic initially serving the dutch states army later becoming a central intellectual of the dutch golden age 91 20 93 although he served a protestant state and was later counted as a deist by critics descartes considered himself a devout catholic many elements of descartes philosophy have precedents in late aristotelianism the revived stoicism of the 16th century or in earlier philosophers like augustine in his natural philosophy he differed from the schools on two major points first he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form second he rejected any appeal to final ends divine or natural in explaining natural phenomena 91 21 93 in his theology he insists on the absolute freedom of god s act of creation refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him in the opening section of the passions of the soul an early modern treatise on emotions descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic as if no one had written on these matters before his best known philosophical statement is cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am french je pense donc je suis found in discourse on the method 1637 in french and latin and principles of philosophy 1644 in latin 91 note 4 93 descartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the 17th century 91 22 93 91 note 5 93 he laid the foundation for 17th century continental rationalism later advocated by spinoza and leibniz and was later opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of hobbes locke berkeley and hume the rise of early modern rationalism as a highly systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history exerted an immense and profound influence on modern western thought in general with the birth of two influential rationalistic philosophical systems of descartes cartesianism and spinoza spinozism it was the 17th century arch rationalists like descartes spinoza and leibniz who have given the age of reason its name and place in history leibniz spinoza 91 23 93 and descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy and descartes and leibniz contributed greatly to science as well 91 24 93 descartes meditations on first philosophy 1641 continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments descartes influence in mathematics is equally apparent the cartesian coordinate system was named after him he is credited as the father of analytic geometry used in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis descartes was also one of the key figures in the scientific revolution coat of arms

march 1596 91 25 93 ren descartes was conceived about halfway through august 1595 his mother jeanne brochard died a few days after giving birth to a still born child in may 1597 91 26 93 91 25 93 descartes father joachim was a member of the parlement of brittany at rennes 91 27 93 58 8202 22 8202 ren lived with his grandmother and with his great uncle although the descartes family was roman catholic the poitou region was controlled by the protestant huguenots 91 28 93 in 1607 late because of his fragile health he entered the jesuit coll ge royal henry le grand at la fl che 91 29 93 91 30 93 where he was introduced to mathematics and physics including galileo s work 91 31 93 91 32 93 while there descartes first encountered hermetic mysticism after graduation in 1614 he studied for two years 1615 16 at the university of poitiers earning a baccalaur at and licence in canon and civil law in 1616 91 31 93 in accordance with his father s wishes that he should become a lawyer 91 33 93 from there he moved to paris in discourse on the method descartes recalls 91 34 93 58 8202 20 21 8202 i entirely abandoned the study of letters resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world i spent the rest of my youth traveling visiting courts and armies mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks gathering various experiences testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way to derive some profit from it graduation registry for descartes at the university of poitiers 1616 in accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer in 1618 descartes joined as a mercenary the protestant dutch states army in breda under the command of maurice of nassau 91 31 93 and undertook a formal study of military engineering as established by simon stevin 91 35 93 58 8202 66 8202 descartes therefore received much encouragement in breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics 91 31 93 in this way he became acquainted with isaac beeckman 91 31 93 the principal of a dordrecht school for whom he wrote the compendium of music written 1618 published 1650 91 36 93 together they worked on free fall catenary conic section and fluid statics both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics 91 37 93 while in the service of the catholic duke maximilian of bavaria from 1619 91 38 93 descartes was present at the battle of the white mountain near prague in november 1620 91 39 93 91 40 93 according to adrien baillet on the night of 10 11 november 1619 st martin s day while stationed in neuburg an der donau descartes shut himself in a room with an oven probably a cocklestove 91 41 93 to escape the cold while within he had three dreams 91 42 93 and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy however it is speculated that what descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome 91 43 93 upon exiting he had formulated analytic geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy he concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be for him the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life s work 91 44 93 91 45 93 descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon his famous i think therefore i am 91 37 93 career edit france edit in 1620 descartes left the army he visited basilica della santa casa in loreto then visited various countries before returning to france and during the next few years he spent time in paris it was there that he composed his first essay on method regulae ad directionem ingenii rules for the direction of the mind 91 37 93 he arrived in la haye in 1623 selling all of his property to invest in bonds which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life 91 35 93 58 8202 132 8202 91 46 93 58 8202 94 8202 descartes was present at the siege of la rochelle by cardinal richelieu in 1627 91 46 93 58 8202 128 8202 in the autumn of that year in the residence of the papal nuncio guidi di bagno where he came with mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist nicolas de villiers sieur de chandoux on the principles of a supposed new philosophy 91 47 93 cardinal b rulle urged him to write an exposition of his new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the inquisition 91 48 93 netherlands edit in amsterdam descartes lived at westermarkt 6 maison descartes left title page of principia philosophiae principles of philosophy 1656 descartes returned to the dutch republic in 1628 91 42 93 in april 1629 he joined the university of franeker studying under adriaan metius either living with a catholic family or renting the sjaerdemaslot the next year under the name poitevin he enrolled at leiden university which at the time was a protestant university 91 49 93 he studied both mathematics with jacobus golius who confronted him with pappus s hexagon theorem and astronomy with martin hortensius 91 50 93 in october 1630 he had a falling out with beeckman whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas in amsterdam he had a relationship with a servant girl helena jans van der strom with whom he had a daughter francine who was born in 1635 in deventer she was baptized a protestant 91 51 93 91 52 93 and died of scarlet fever at the age of 5 unlike many moralists of the time descartes did not deprecate the passions but rather defended them 91 citation needed 93 he wept upon francine s death in 1640 91 53 93 according to a recent biography by jason porterfield descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man 91 54 93 russell shorto speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in descartes s work changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers 91 55 93 despite frequent moves 91 note 6 93 he wrote all of his major work during his 20 plus years in the netherlands initiating a revolution in mathematics and philosophy 91 note 7 93 in 1633 galileo was condemned by the italian inquisition and descartes abandoned plans to publish treatise on the world his work of the previous four years nevertheless in 1637 he published parts of this work in three essays 91 56 93 les m t ores the meteors la dioptrique dioptrics and la g om trie geometry preceded by an introduction his famous discours de la m thode discourse on the method 91 56 93 in it descartes lays out four rules of thought meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation 91 57 93 the first was never to accept anything for true which i did not know to be such that is to say carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt in la g om trie descartes exploited the discoveries he made with pierre de fermat having been able to do so because his paper introduction to loci was published posthumously in 1679 this later became known as cartesian geometry 91 58 93 descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life in 1641 he published a metaphysics treatise meditationes de prima philosophia meditations on first philosophy written in latin and thus addressed to the learned it was followed in 1644 by principia philosophiae principles of philosophy a kind of synthesis of the discourse on the method and meditations on first philosophy in 1643 cartesian philosophy was condemned at the university of utrecht and descartes was obliged to flee to the hague settling in egmond binnen between 1643 and 1649 descartes lived with his girlfriend at egmond binnen in an inn 91 59 93 descartes became friendly with anthony studler van zurck lord of bergen and participated in the design of his mansion and estate 91 60 93 91 61 93 91 62 93 he also met dirck rembrantsz van nierop a mathematician and surveyor 91 63 93 he was so impressed by van nierop s knowledge that he even brought him to the attention of constantijn huygens and frans van schooten 91 64 93 christia mercer suggested that descartes may have been influenced by spanish author and roman catholic nun teresa of vila who fifty years earlier published the interior castle concerning the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth 91 12 93 91 65 93 descartes began through alfonso polloti an italian general in dutch service a six year correspondence with princess elisabeth of bohemia devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects 91 66 93 connected with this correspondence in 1649 he published les passions de l me the passions of the soul which he dedicated to the princess a french translation of principia philosophiae prepared by abbot claude picot was published in 1647 this edition was also dedicated to princess elisabeth in the preface to the french edition descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom he identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth better and more secure consisting in the search for first causes 91 67 93 sweden edit by 1649 descartes had become one of europe s most famous philosophers and scientists 91 56 93 that year queen christina of sweden invited him to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love descartes accepted and moved to sweden in the middle of winter 91 68 93 she was interested in and stimulated descartes to publish the passions of the soul 91 69 93 he was a guest at the house of pierre chanut living on v sterl nggatan less than 500 meters from tre kronor in stockholm there chanut and descartes made observations with a torricellian mercury barometer challenging blaise pascal descartes took the first set of barometric readings in stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather 91 70 93 death edit descartes arranged to give lessons to queen christina after her birthday three times a week at 5 am in her cold and draughty castle it soon became clear they did not like each other she did not care for his mechanical philosophy nor did he share her interest in ancient greek by 15 january 1650 descartes had seen christina only four or five times on 1 february he contracted pneumonia and died on 11 february at chanut 91 71 93 yesterday morning about four o clock a m has deceased here at the house of his excellency mr chanut french ambassador mr descartes as i have been informed he had been ill for a few days with pleurisy but as he did not want to take or use medicines a hot fever appears to have arisen as well thereupon he had himself bled three times in one day but without operation of losing much blood her majesty much bemoaned his decease because he was such a learned man he has been cast in wax it was not his intention to die here as he had resolved shortly before his death to return to holland at the first occasion etc 91 72 93 the cause of death was pneumonia according to chanut but peripneumonia according to christina s physician johann van wullen who was not allowed to bleed him 91 73 93 the winter seems to have been mild 91 74 93 except for the second half of january which was harsh as described by descartes himself however this remark was probably intended to be as much descartes take on the intellectual climate as it was about the weather 91 69 93 left the tomb of descartes middle with detail of the inscription in the abbey of saint germain des pr s paris right memorial to descartes erected in the 1720s in the adolf fredriks kyrka e pies has questioned this account based on a letter by the doctor van wullen however descartes had refused his treatment and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since 91 75 93 in a 2009 book german philosopher theodor ebert argues that descartes was poisoned by a catholic missionary who opposed his religious views 91 76 93 91 77 93 91 78 93 as a catholic 91 79 93 91 80 93 91 81 93 in a protestant nation he was interred in a graveyard used mainly for orphans in adolf fredriks kyrka in stockholm his manuscripts came into the possession of claude clerselier chanut s brother in law and a devout catholic who has begun the process of turning descartes into a saint by cutting adding and publishing his letters selectively 91 82 93 91 83 93 58 8202 137 154 8202 in 1663 the pope placed descartes works on the index of prohibited books in 1666 sixteen years after his death his remains were taken to france and buried in saint tienne du mont in 1671 louis xiv prohibited all lectures in cartesianism although the national convention in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the panth on he was reburied in the abbey of saint germain des pr s in 1819 missing a finger and the skull 91 note 8 93 his skull is on display in the mus e de l homme in paris 91 84 93 philosophical work edit ren descartes at work further information cartesianism in his discourse on the method he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt to achieve this he employs a method called hyperbolical metaphysical doubt also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or cartesian doubt he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge 91 85 93 descartes built his ideas from scratch which he does in the meditations on first philosophy he relates this to architecture the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings to descartes aristotle s foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism 91 86 93 initially descartes arrives at only a single first principle that he thinks this is expressed in the latin phrase in the discourse on method cogito ergo sum english i think therefore i am 91 87 93 descartes concluded if he doubted then something or someone must be doing the doubting therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence the simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence that is in and of itself proof that he does exist 91 88 93 these two first principles i think and i exist were later confirmed by descartes clear and distinct perception delineated in his third meditation from the meditations as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles descartes reasoned ensures their indubitability descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks but in what form he perceives his body through the use of the senses however these have previously been unreliable so descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a thinking thing thinking is what he does and his power must come from his essence descartes defines thought cogitatio as what happens in me such that i am immediately conscious of it insofar as i am conscious of it thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious 91 89 93 he gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams and that one s mind cannot have been hijacked by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before one s senses 91 86 93 and so something that i thought i was seeing with my eyes is grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind 91 90 93 58 8202 109 8202 in this manner descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge discarding perception as unreliable and instead admitting only deduction as a method 91 91 93 mind body dualism edit further information mind body problem and mind body dualism l homme 1664 descartes influenced by the automatons on display throughout the city of paris began to investigate the connection between the mind and body and how the two interact 91 citation needed 93 his main influences for dualism were theology and physics 91 92 93 the theory on the dualism of mind and body is descartes signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced known as cartesian dualism or mind body dualism his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent western philosophies 91 93 93 in meditations on first philosophy descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of god and the distinction between the human soul and the body humans are a union of mind and body 91 94 93 thus descartes s dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined while many contemporary readers of descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp he thought it was entirely straightforward descartes employed the concept of modes which are the ways in which substances exist in principles of philosophy descartes explained we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it whereas we cannot conversely understand the mode apart from the substance to perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction 91 95 93 which descartes explained as follows the intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention thus when i consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is i make a mental abstraction 91 95 93 according to descartes two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other thus descartes reasoned that god is distinct from humans and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another 91 96 93 he argued that the great differences between body an extended thing and mind an un extended immaterial thing make the two ontologically distinct according to descartes indivisibility argument the mind is utterly indivisible because when i consider the mind or myself in so far as i am merely a thinking thing i am unable to distinguish any part within myself i understand myself to be something quite single and complete 91 97 93 moreover in the meditations descartes discusses a piece of wax and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of cartesian dualism that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances the mind or soul defined as thinking and the body defined as matter and unthinking 91 98 93 the aristotelian philosophy of descartes days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological everything that happened be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose goal or end that worked its way out within nature aristotle called this the final cause and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated descartes theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional aristotelian science and the new science of kepler and galileo which denied the role of a divine power and final causes in its attempts to explain nature descartes dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe or res extensa in favor of the mind or res cogitans therefore while cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul 91 99 93 descartes dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings a human was according to descartes a composite entity of mind and body descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body but the body could not exist without the mind in the meditations descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance the body is composed only of accidents 91 100 93 but he did argue that mind and body are closely joined 91 101 93 nature also teaches me by the sensations of pain hunger thirst and so on that i am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship but that i am very closely joined and as it were intermingled with it so that i and the body form a unit if this were not so i who am nothing but a thinking thing would not feel pain when the body was hurt but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken 91 101 93 descartes discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy what exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person 91 101 93 therefore cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mind body problem for many years after descartes death 91 102 93 descartes was also a rationalist and believed in the power of innate ideas 91 103 93 descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of god it was this theory of innate knowledge that was later combated by philosopher john locke 1632 1704 an empiricist 91 104 93 empiricism holds that all knowledge is acquired through experience physiology and psychology edit in the passions of the soul published in 1649 91 105 93 descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits these animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles these animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul or passions of the soul descartes distinguished six basic passions wonder love hatred desire joy and sadness all of these passions he argued represented different combinations of the original spirit and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions he argued for example that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body in line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector 91 106 93 descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland through animal spirits thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits he argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on god s will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them but he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland thus humans had to learn how to control their passions 91 107 93 descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th century reflex theory he argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits for example heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire 91 107 93 through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process 91 103 93 above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation he challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous 91 108 93 descartes writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries he believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind 91 citation needed 93 in the 20th century alan turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by descartes his theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories more than 200 years after his death the physiologist ivan pavlov was a great admirer of descartes 91 109 93 moral philosophy edit for descartes ethics was a science the highest and most perfect of them like the rest of the sciences ethics had its roots in metaphysics 91 91 93 in this way he argues for the existence of god investigates the place of man in nature formulates the theory of mind body dualism and defends free will however as he was a convinced rationalist descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions nevertheless the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge because a well informed mind will be more capable of making good choices and it also depends on mental condition for this reason he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body 91 110 93 58 8202 189 8202 he discussed this subject in the correspondence with princess elisabeth of bohemia and as a result wrote his work the passions of the soul that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man with an emphasis on emotions or passions 91 111 93 his works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers see cartesianism and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be specifically how it should invoke emotion 91 112 93 humans should seek the sovereign good that descartes following zeno identifies with virtue as this produces blessedness for epicurus the sovereign good was pleasure and descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with zeno s teaching because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure regarding aristotle s opinion that happiness eudaimonia depends on both moral virtue and also on the goods of fortune such as a moderate degree of wealth descartes does not deny that fortunes contribute to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one s own control whereas one s mind is under one s complete control 91 111 93 the moral writings of descartes came at the last part of his life but earlier in his discourse on the method he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he

mounier pieper rahner stein taylor 160 catholicism 32 portal 160 philosophy 32 portalvte in the third and fifth meditation descartes offers proofs of a benevolent god the trademark argument and the ontological argument respectively because god is benevolent descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him for god has provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him from this supposition however descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception regarding epistemology therefore descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge descartes however was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories 91 91 93 descartes invokes his causal adequacy principle 91 113 93 to support his trademark argument for the existence of god quoting lucretius in defence ex nihilo nihil fit meaning nothing comes from nothing lucretius 91 114 93 oxford reference summarises the argument as follows that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin god just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker 91 115 93 in the fifth meditation descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite and suggests that of all the ideas that are in me the idea that i have of god is the most true the most clear and distinct 91 116 93 descartes considered himself to be a devout catholic 91 79 93 91 80 93 91 81 93 and one of the purposes of the meditations was to defend the catholic faith his attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time pascal regarded descartes views as a rationalist and mechanist and accused him of deism i cannot forgive descartes in all his philosophy descartes did his best to dispense with god but descartes could not avoid prodding god to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers after that he had no more use for god while a powerful contemporary martin schoock accused him of atheist beliefs though descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his meditations the catholic church prohibited his books in 1663 91 117 93 91 118 93 91 119 93 58 8202 274 8202 descartes also wrote a response to external world skepticism through this method of skepticism he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information in other words certainty he argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily and are not willed by him they are external to his senses and according to descartes this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind and thus an external world descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that god would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted and that god has given him the propensity to believe that such ideas are caused by material things descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist descartes further explains how only god can be a true substance but minds are substances meaning they need only god for it to function the mind is a thinking substance the means for a thinking substance stem from ideas 91 120 93 descartes steered clear of theological questions restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy he avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically when challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances he replied i do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of god 91 121 93 natural science edit descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences 91 122 93 for him philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge as he related in a letter to a french translator 91 91 93 thus all philosophy is like a tree of which metaphysics is the root physics the trunk and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk which are reduced to three principals namely medicine mechanics and ethics by the science of morals i understand the highest and most perfect which presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences is the last degree of wisdom on animals edit descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence 91 123 93 he argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions but these could be explained mechanistically 91 124 93 whereas humans had a soul or mind and were able to feel pain and anxiety animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety if animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent 91 125 93 although descartes views were not universally accepted they became prominent in europe and north america allowing humans to treat animals with impunity the view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century 91 126 93 58 8202 180 214 8202 the publications of charles darwin would eventually erode the cartesian view of animals 91 127 93 58 8202 37 8202 darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species opened the possibilities that animals did not have dissimilar properties to suffer 91 128 93 58 8202 177 8202 historical impact edit emancipation from church doctrine edit cover of meditations descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern western philosophy the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of western philosophy and set the basis for modernity 91 22 93 91 129 93 the first two of his meditations on first philosophy those that formulate the famous methodic doubt represent the portion of descartes s writings that most influenced modern thinking 91 130 93 it has been argued that descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move 91 131 93 in shifting the debate from what is true to of what can i be certain descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from god to humanity even though descartes himself claimed he received his visions from god while the traditional concept of truth implies an external authority certainty instead relies on the judgment of the individual in an anthropocentric revolution the human being is now raised to the level of a subject an agent an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason this was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity the repercussions of which are still being felt the emancipation of humanity from christian revelational truth and church doctrine humanity making its own law and taking its own stand 91 132 93 91 133 93 91 134 93 in modernity the guarantor of truth is not god anymore but human beings each of whom is a self conscious shaper and guarantor of their own reality 91 135 93 91 136 93 in that way each person is turned into a reasoning adult a subject and agent 91 135 93 as opposed to a child obedient to god this change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the christian medieval period to the modern period a shift that had been anticipated in other fields and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by descartes 91 135 93 91 137 93 this anthropocentric perspective of descartes s work establishing human reason as autonomous provided the basis for the enlightenment s emancipation from god and the church according to martin heidegger the perspective of descartes s work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology 91 138 93 descartes s philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism 91 22 93 91 139 93 91 140 93 91 141 93 mathematical legacy edit a cartesian coordinates graph using his invented x and y axes one of descartes s most enduring legacies was his development of cartesian or analytic geometry which uses algebra to describe geometry descartes invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x y and z and knowns by a b and c he also pioneered the standard notation that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents for example the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared 91 142 93 91 143 93 58 8202 19 8202 he was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning particularly about abstract unknown quantities 91 144 93 58 8202 91 114 8202 european mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics serving as the foundation of algebra algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as pacioli cardan tartaglia and ferrari equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal because a three dimensional form such as a cube occupied the largest dimension of reality descartes professed that the abstract quantity a2 could represent length as well as an area this was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as fran ois vi te who insisted that a second power must represent an area although descartes did not pursue the subject he preceded gottfried wilhelm leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or universal mathematics as a precursor to symbolic logic that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically and mechanize general reasoning 91 145 93 58 8202 280 281 8202 descartes s work provided the basis for the calculus developed by newton and leibniz who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics 91 146 93 his rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial the beginning to descartes s interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician isaac beeckman who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy with this foundation of reasoning descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometric physics 91 147 93 descartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of momentum a measure of the motion of an object and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line as opposed to perfect circular motion as galileo had envisioned it 91 147 93 91 148 93 he outlined his views on the universe in his principles of philosophy where he describes his three laws of motion 91 149 93 newton s own laws of motion would later be modeled on descartes exposition 91 147 93 descartes also made contributions to the field of optics he showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction also known as descartes s law or more commonly snell s law outside france that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42 degrees i e the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow s centre is 42 91 150 93 he also independently discovered the law of reflection and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law 91 151 93 influence on newton s mathematics edit current popular opinion holds that descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young isaac newton and this is arguably one of his most important contributions decartes influence extended not directly from his original french edition of la g om trie however but rather from frans van schooten s expanded second latin edition of the work 91 152 93 58 8202 100 8202 newton continued descartes work on cubic equations which freed the subject from fetters of the greek perspectives the most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables 91 153 93 58 8202 109 129 8202 newton rejected descartes vortex theory of planetary motion in favor of his law of universal gravitation and most of the second book of newton s principia is devoted to his counterargument contemporary reception edit in commercial terms the discourse appeared during descartes s lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies 200 of which were set aside for the author sharing a similar fate was the only french edition of the meditations which had not managed to sell out by the time of descartes s death a concomitant latin edition of the latter was however eagerly sought out by europe s scholarly community and proved a commercial success for descartes 91 154 93 58 8202 xliii xliv 8202 although descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life the teaching of his works in schools was controversial henri de roy henricus regius 1598 1679 professor of medicine at the university of utrecht was condemned by the rector of the university gijsbert voet voetius for teaching descartes s physics 91 155 93 purported rosicrucianism edit the membership of descartes to the rosicrucians is debated 91 156 93 the initials of his name have been linked to the r c acronym widely used by rosicrucians 91 157 93 furthermore in 1619 descartes moved to ulm which was a well renowned international center of the rosicrucian movement 91 157 93 during his journey in germany descartes met johannes faulhaber who had previously expressed his personal commitment to join the brotherhood 91 158 93 descartes dedicated the work titled the mathematical treasure trove of polybius citizen of the
