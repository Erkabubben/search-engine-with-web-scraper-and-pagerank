an individual s support for social hierarchy and the extent to which they desire their in group be superior to out groups 91 2 93 sdo is conceptualized under social dominance theory as a measure of individual differences in levels of group based discrimination that is it is a measure of an individual s preference for hierarchy within any social system and the domination over lower status groups it is a predisposition toward anti egalitarianism within and between groups individuals who score high in sdo desire to maintain and in many cases increase the differences between social statuses of different groups as well as individual group members typically they are dominant driven tough and seekers of power 91 citation needed 93 people high in sdo also prefer hierarchical group orientations often people who score high in sdo adhere strongly to belief in a dog eat dog world 91 3 93 it has also been found that men are generally higher than women in sdo measures 91 4 93 91 5 93 91 page 160

sdo was first proposed by jim sidanius and felicia pratto as part of their social dominance theory sdt sdo is the key measurable component of sdt that is specific to it sdt begins with the empirical observation that surplus producing social systems have a threefold group based hierarchy structure age based gender based and arbitrary set based which can include race class sexual orientation caste ethnicity religious affiliation etc age based hierarchies invariably give more power to adults and middle age people than children and younger adults and gender based hierarchies invariably grant more power to one gender over others but arbitrary set hierarchies though quite resilient are truly arbitrary 91 citation needed 93 sdt is based on three primary assumptions 91 6 93 while age and gender based hierarchies will tend to exist within all social systems arbitrary set systems of social hierarchy will invariably emerge within social systems producing sustainable economic surpluses most forms of group conflict and oppression e g racism homophobia ethnocentrism sexism classism regionalism can be regarded as different manifestations of the same basic human predisposition to form group based hierarchies human social systems are subject to the counterbalancing influences of hierarchy enhancing he forces producing and maintaining ever higher levels of group based social inequality and hierarchy attenuating ha forces producing greater levels of group based social equality sdo is the individual attitudinal aspect of sdt it is influenced by group status socialization and temperament in turn it influences support for he and ha legitimating myths defined as values attitudes beliefs causal attributions and ideologies that in turn justify social institutions and practices that either enhance or attenuate group hierarchy legitimising myths are used by sdt to refer to widely accepted ideologies that are accepted as explaining how the world works sdt does not have a position on the veracity morality or rationality of these beliefs 91 2 93 as the theory is intended to be a descriptive account of group based inequality rather than a normative theory 91 7 93 early development edit while the correlation of gender with sdo scores has been empirically measured and confirmed 91 8 93 the impact of temperament and socialization is less clear duckitt has suggested a model of attitude development for sdo suggesting that unaffectionate socialisation in childhood causes a tough minded attitude according to duckitt s model people high in tough minded personality are predisposed to view the world as a competitive place in which resource competition is zero sum a desire to compete which fits with social dominance orientation influences in group and outside group attitudes people high in sdo also believe that hierarchies are present in all aspects of society and are more likely to agree with statements such as it s probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom scale edit sdo has been measured by a series of scales that have been refined over time all of which contain a balance of pro and contra trait statements or phrases a 7 point likert scale is used for each item participants rate their agreement or disagreement with the statements from 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree most of the research was conducted with the sdo 5 a 14 point scale and sdo 6 the sdo 7 scale is the most recent scale measuring social dominance orientation which embeds two sub dimensions dominance sdo d and anti egalitarianism sdo e 91 9 93

reverse scored no group should dominate in society reverse scored keying is reversed on questions 9 through 16 to control for acquiescence bias criticisms of the construct edit rubin and hewstone 2004 91 11 93 argue that social dominance research has changed its focus dramatically over the years and these changes have been reflected in different versions of the social dominance orientation construct social dominance orientation was originally defined as the degree to which individuals desire social dominance and superiority for themselves and their primordial groups over other groups p 160 209 91 12 93 it then quickly changed to not only a a desire for and value given to in group dominance over out groups but also b the desire for nonegalitarian hierarchical relationships between groups within the social system p 160 1007 91 13 93 the most recent measure of social dominance orientation see sdo 6 above focuses on the general desire for unequal relations among social groups regardless of whether this means ingroup domination or ingroup subordination p 160 312 91 14 93 given these changes rubin and hewstone believe that evidence for social dominance theory should be considered as supporting three separate sdo hypotheses rather than one single theory p 160 22 91 11 93 group based and individual dominance edit robert altemeyer said that people with a high sdo want more power agreeing with items such as winning is more important than how you play the game and are higher on machiavellianism 91 15 93 91 page 160 needed 93 these observations are at odds with conceptualisations of sdo as a group based phenomenon suggesting that the sdo reflects interpersonal dominance not only group based dominance this is supported by sidanius and pratto s own evidence that high sdo individuals tend to gravitate toward hierarchy enhancing jobs and institutions such as law enforcement that are themselves hierarchically structured vis a vis individuals within them relations with other personality traits edit connection with right wing authoritarianism edit sdo correlates weakly with right wing authoritarianism rwa r 18 91 2 93 both predict attitudes such as sexist racist and heterosexist attitudes 91 16 93 the two contribute to different forms of prejudice sdo correlates to higher prejudice against subordinate and disadvantaged groups rwa correlates to higher prejudice against groups deemed threatening to traditional norms while both are associated with increases in prejudice for dissident groups 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 sdo and rwa contribute to prejudice in an additive rather than interactive way the interaction 91 clarification needed 93 of sdo and rwa accounted in one study for an average of less than 001 variance in addition to their linear combination that is the association between sdo and prejudice is similar regardless of a person s level of rwa and vice versa 91 16 93 crawford et al 2013 found that rwa and sdo differentially predicted interpretations of media reports about socially threatening for example gays and lesbians and disadvantaged groups for example african americans respectively subjects with high sdo but not rwa scores reacted positively to articles and authors that opposed affirmative action and negatively to pro affirmative action article content moreover rwa but not sdo predicted subjects evaluations of same sex relationships such that high rwa individuals favored anti same sex relationships article content and low rwa individuals favorably rated pro same sex relationships content 91 17 93 correlation with big five personality traits edit studies on the relationship of sdo with the higher order big five personality traits have associated high sdo with lower openness to experience and lower agreeableness 91 20 93 meta analytic aggregation of these studies indicates that the association with low agreeableness is more robust than the link to openness to experience 91 21 93 individuals low in agreeableness are more inclined to report being motivated by self interest and self indulgence 91 22 93 they also tend to be more self centred and are more tough minded compared to those who are high on agreeableness leading them to perceive the world to be a highly competitive place where the way to success is through power and dominance all of which predict sdo 91 23 93 low openness by contrast aligns more strongly with rwa thinking in clear and straightforward moral codes that dictate how society as a system should function being low in openness prompts the individual to value security stability and control fundamental elements of rwa 91 23 93 facet level associations edit in case of sdo all five facets of agreeableness significantly correlate negatively even after controlling for rwa 91 21 93 tough mindedness opposite of tender mindedness facet is the strongest predictor of sdo after the effect of sdo is controlled for only one facet of agreeableness is predictive of rwa 91 citation needed 93 facets also distinguish sdo from rwa with dominators individuals high on sdo but not authoritarians individuals who score high on rwa having been found to be lower in dutifulness morality sympathy and co operation 91 24 93 rwa is also associated with religiosity conservativism righteousness and to some extent a conscientious moral code which distinguishes rwa from sdo empathy edit sdo is inversely related to empathy facets of agreeableness that are linked to altruism sympathy and compassion are the strongest predictors of sdo 91 2 93 sdo has been suggested to have a link with callous affect which is to be found on the psychopathy sub scale the polar opposite of empathy 91 25 93 the relationship between sdo and lack of empathy has been found to be reciprocal 91 26 93 with equivocal findings some studies show that empathy significantly impacts sdo 91 27 93 whereas other research suggest the opposite effect is more robust that sdo predicts empathy 91 26 93 the latter showcases how powerful of a predictor sdo may be not only affecting individual s certain behaviours but potentially influencing upstream the proneness to those behaviours it also suggests that those scoring high on sdo proactively avoid scenarios that could prompt them to be more empathetic or tender minded this avoidance decreases concern for other s welfare 91 26 93 empathy indirectly affects generalized prejudice through its negative relationship with sdo 91 27 93 it also has a direct effect on generalized prejudice as lack of empathy makes one unable to put oneself in the other person s shoes which predicts prejudice and antidemocratic views some recent research has suggested the relationship between sdo and empathy may be more complex arguing that people with high levels of sdo are less likely to show empathy towards low status people but more likely to show it towards high status people conversely people with low sdo levels demonstrate the reverse behaviour 91 28 93 other findings and criticisms edit research suggests that people high in sdo tend to support using violence in intergroup relations while those low in sdo oppose it however it has also been argued that people low in sdo can also support and those high in it oppose violence in some circumstances if the violence is seen as a form of counterdominance for example lebanese people low in sdo approved more strongly of terrorism against the west than lebanese people high in sdo seemingly because it entailed a low status group lebanese attacking a high status one westerners 91 29 93 amongst palestinians lower sdo levels were correlated with more emotional hostility towards israelis and more parochial empathy for palestinians 91 30 93 low levels of sdo have been found to result in individuals possessing positive biases towards outgroup members for example regarding outgroup members as less irrational than ingroup members the reverse of what is usually found 91 31 93 low levels of sdo have also been found to be linked to being better at detecting inequalities applied to low status groups but not the same inequalities applied to high status groups 91 32 93 a person s sdo levels can also affect the degree to which they perceive hierarchies either over or underestimating them although the effect sizes may be quite small 91 33 93 a person s sdo levels can also shift depending on their identification with their ingroup and low levels of sdo thus may reflect a more complex relationship to ideas of inequality and social hierarchy than just egalitarianism 91 34 93 in the contemporary us research indicates that most people tend to score fairly low on the sdo scale with an average score of 2 98 on a 7 point scale with 7 being the highest in sdo and 1 the lowest with a standard deviation of 1 19 91 28 93 this has also been found to apply cross culturally with the average sdo score being around 2 6 although there was some variation switzerland scoring somewhat lower and japan scoring substantially higher 91 35 93 91 36 93 a study in new zealand found that 91 of the population had low to moderate sdo levels levels of 1 4 on the scale indicating that the majority of variance in sdo occurs within this band 91 37 93 a 2013 multi national study found average scores ranged from 2 5 to 4 91 38 93 because sdo scales tend to skew towards egalitarianism some researchers have argued that this has caused a misinterpretation of correlations between sdo scores and other variables arguing that low sdo scorers rather than high sdo scorers are possibly driving most of the correlations thus sdo research may actually be discovering the psychology of egalitarianism rather than the reverse 91 39 93 91 40 93 samantha stanley argues that high sdo scorers are generally in the middle of the sdo scale and thus she suggests their score do not actually represent an endorsement of inequality but rather a greater tolerance or ambivalence towards it than low sdo scorers stanley suggests that true high sdo scorers are possibly quite rare and that researchers need to make clearer what exactly they are defining high sdo scores as as prior studies did not always report the actual level of sdo endorsement from high scorers 91 41 93 some researchers have raised concerns that the trait is studied under an ideological framework of viewing group based interactions as one of victims and victimisers hence its label as social dominance orientation and that research into sdo should instead look into social organisation rather than social dominance 91 42 93 sdo has been found to be related to color blindness as a racial ideology for low sdo individuals color blindness predicts more negative attitudes towards ethnic minorities but for high sdo individuals it predicts more positive attitudes 91 43 93 sdo levels can also interact with other variables when assessing blame for the 2011 england riots high sdo individuals uniformly blamed ethnic diversity regardless of whether they agreed with official government discourse whereas low sdo individuals did not blame ethnic diversity if they disagreed with official government discourse but did blame ethnic diversity if they did agree almost to the same degree as high sdo individuals 91 44 93 another study found that in a mock hiring experiment participants high in sdo were more likely to favour a white applicant while those low in sdo were more likely to favour a black applicant 91 45 93 while in mock juror research high sdo white jurors showed anti black bias and low sdo white jurors pro black bias 91 46 93 low sdo individuals may also support hierarchy enhancing beliefs such as gender essentialism and meritocracy if they believe this will support diversity 91 47 93 sdo has also been found to relate to attitudes towards social class 91 48 93 91 49 93 self perceived attractiveness can also interact with a person s sdo levels due to perceived effects on social class changing a person s self perceived level of attractiveness affected their self perceived social class and thus their sdo levels 91 50 93 a study report published by nature in 2017 indicates there may be a correlation between fmri scanned brain response to social ranks and the sdo scale subjects who tended to prefer hierarchical social structures and to promote socially dominant behaviors as measured by sdo exhibited stronger responses in the right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex right adlpfc when facing superior players the french national agency for research funded study involved 28 male subjects and used fmri measurements to demonstrate that response in the right adlpfc to social ranks was strongly correlated with participant sdo scores measuring response to social ranks 91 51 93 correlation with conservative political views edit felicia pratto and her colleagues have found evidence that a high social dominance orientation is strongly correlated with conservative political views and opposition to programs and policies that aim to promote equality such as affirmative action laws advocating equal rights for homosexuals women in combat etc 91 2 93 there has been some debate within the psychology community on what the relation is between sdo and racism sexism one explanation suggests that opposition to programs that promote equality need not be based on racism or sexism but on a principled conservatism 91 52 93 that is a concern for equality of opportunity color blindness and genuine conservative values some principled conservatism theorists have suggested that racism and conservatism are independent and only very weakly correlated among the highly educated who truly understand the concepts of conservative values and attitudes in an effort to examine the relationship between education sdo and racism sidanius and his colleagues 91 52 93 asked approximately 4 600 euro americans to complete a survey in which they were asked about their political and social attitudes and their social dominance orientation was assessed these findings contradict much of the case for the principled conservatism hypothesis which maintains that political values that are largely devoid of racism especially among highly educated people contrary to what these theorists would predict correlations among sdo political conservatism and racism were strongest among the most educated and weakest among the least educated sidanius and his colleagues hypothesized 91 52 93 this was because the most educated conservatives tend to be more invested in the hierarchical structure of society and in maintaining the inequality of the status quo in society in order to safeguard their status sdo levels can also shift in response to threats to political party identity with conservatives responding to party identity threat by increasing sdo levels and liberals responding by lowering them 91 53 93 culture edit sdo is typically measured as an individual personality construct however cultural forms of sdo have been discovered on the macro level of society 91 36 93 discrimination prejudice and stereotyping can occur at various levels of institutions in society such as transnational corporations government agencies schools and criminal justice systems the basis of this theory of societal level sdo is rooted in evolutionary psychology which states that humans have an evolved predisposition to express social dominance that is heightened under certain social conditions such as group status and is also mediated by factors such as individual personality and temperament democratic societies are lower in sdo measures 91 36 93 the more that a society encourages citizens to cooperate with others and feel concern for the welfare of others the lower the sdo in that culture high levels of national income and empowerment of women are also associated with low national sdo whereas more traditional societies with lower income male domination and more closed institutional systems are associated with a higher sdo individuals who are socialized within these traditional societies are more likely to internalize gender hierarchies and are less likely to challenge them 91 citation needed 93 biology and sexual differences edit the biology of sdo is unknown 91 citation needed 93 plenty of evidence suggests that men tend to score higher on sdo than women and this is true across different countries cultures age groups classes religions and educational levels 91 13 93 with the difference generally being an average of half a point on the scale 91 35 93 researchers argue for an invariance in the difference between men and women s sdo suggesting that even if all other factors were to be controlled for the difference between men and women s sdo would still remain this however in some cases has been challenged although exceptions may be due to complex and highly dependent factors 91 54 93 from an evolutionary and biological perspective sdo facilitates men to be successful in their reproductive strategy through achieving social power and control over other males and becoming desired mating partners for the opposite sex 91 55 93 males are observed to be more socially hierarchical as indicated by speaking time 91 56 93 and yielding to interruptions 91 57 93 males higher average sdo levels has been suggested as an explanation for gender differences in support for policies males are more likely to support military force defence spending and the death penalty and less likely to support social welfare or minimum wage legislation while females are more likely to believe in the reverse this is because males due to being more likely to have higher sdo scores are more likely to view inequalities as the natural result of competition and thus are more likely to have a negative view of policies designed to mitigate or dilute the effects of competition 91 58 93 noting that males tend to have higher sdo scores than females sidanius and pratto speculate that sdo may be influenced by hormones that differ between the sexes namely androgens primarily testosterone male levels of testosterone are much higher than those of females taking a socio cultural perspective it is argued that the gap between women and men in sdo is dependent upon societal norms prescribing different expectations for gender roles of men and women 91 59 93 men are expected to be dominant and assertive whereas women are supposed to be submissive and tender differences between male and female attributional cognitive complexity are suggested to contribute to the gender gap in sdo 91 60 93 women have been found to be more attributionally complex compared to men they use more contextual information and evaluate social information more precisely it is proposed that lower social status prompts higher cognitive complexity in order to compensate for the lack of control in that social situation by processing it more attentively and evaluating it more in depth the difference in cognitive complexity between high and low status individuals could contribute to the differences between male and female sdo 91 60 93 some evidence suggests that both the dominance and anti egalitarianism dimensions of sdo are determined by genetic rather than environmental factors 91 61 93 see also edit right wing authoritarianism common ingroup identity demagogy moral majority
