by the rejection of political plurality the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo and reductions in the rule of law separation of powers and democratic voting 91 1 93 91 2 93 political scientists have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government 91 2 93 authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military 91 3 93 91 4 93 states that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as hybrid democracies hybrid regimes or competitive authoritarian states 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 the political scientist juan linz in an influential 91 8 93 1964 work an authoritarian regime spain defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities limited political pluralism is realized with constraints on the legislature political parties and interest groups political legitimacy is based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat easily recognizable societal problems such as underdevelopment or insurgency minimal political mobilization and suppression of anti regime activities ill defined executive powers often vague and shifting extends the power of the executive 91 9 93 91 10 93 minimally defined an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives or both 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 broadly defined authoritarian states include countries that lack civil liberties such as freedom of religion or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections 91 15 93 authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent non competitive elections 91 16 93 since 1946 the share of authoritarian states in the international political system increased until the mid 1970s but declined from then until the year 2000 91 17 93 contents 1 characteristics 1

external links characteristics authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and centralized government power maintained by political repression and the exclusion of potential challengers it uses political parties and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime 91 18 93 adam przeworski has theorized that authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies fear and economic prosperity 91 19 93 however daniel a bell and wang pei used china s experience with covid 19 to argue that the categories are not so clear cut 91 20 93 authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of political power a leadership that is self appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens free choice among competitors the arbitrary deprivation of civil liberties and little tolerance for meaningful opposition 91 18 93 a range of social controls also attempt to stifle civil society while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the armed forces a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of allegiance through various means of socialization and indoctrination 91 18 93 authoritarianism is marked by indefinite political tenure of the ruler or ruling party often in a one party state or other authority 91 18 93 the transition from an authoritarian system to a more democratic form of government is referred to as democratization 91 18 93 constitutions in authoritarian regimes authoritarian regimes often adopt the institutional trappings of democracies such as constitutions 91 21 93 constitutions in authoritarian states may serve a variety of roles including operating manual describing how the government is to function billboard signal of regime s intent blueprint outline of future regime plans and window dressing material designed to obfuscate such as provisions setting forth freedoms that are not honored in practice 91 22 93 authoritarian constitutions may help legitimize strengthen and consolidate regimes 91 23 93 an authoritarian constitution that successfully coordinates government action and defines popular expectations can also help consolidate the regime s grip on power by inhibiting re coordination on a different set of arrangements 91 24 93 unlike democratic constitutions authoritarian constitutions do not set direct limits on executive authority however in some cases such documents may function as ways for elites to protect their own property rights or constrain autocrats behavior 91 25 93 the soviet constitution of 1918 the first charter of the new russian socialist federated soviet republic rsfsr was described by vladimir lenin as a revolutionary document it was he said unlike any constitution drafted by a nation state 91 26 93 the concept of authoritarian constitutionalism has been developed by legal scholar mark tushnet 91 27 93 tushnet distinguishes authoritarian constitutionalist regimes from liberal constitutionalist regimes the sort familiar in the modern west with core commitments to human rights and self governance implemented by means of varying institutional devices and from purely authoritarian regimes which reject the idea of human rights or constraints on leaders power 91 27 93 he describes authoritarian constitutionalist regimes as 1 authoritarian dominant party states that 2 impose sanctions such as libel judgments against but do not arbitrarily arrest political dissidents 3 permit reasonably open discussion and criticism of its policies 4 hold reasonably free and fair elections without systemic intimidation but with close attention to such matters as the drawing of election districts and the creation of party lists to ensure as best it can that it will prevail and by a substantial margin 5 reflect at least occasional responsiveness to public opinion and 6 create mechanisms to ensure that the amount of dissent does not exceed the level it regards as desirable tushnet cites singapore as an example of an authoritarian constitutionalist state and connects the concept to that of hybrid regimes 91 27 93 economy scholars such as seymour lipset 91 28 93 carles boix susan stokes 91 29 93 dietrich rueschemeyer evelyne stephens and john stephens 91 30 93 argue that economic development increases the likelihood of democratization adam przeworski and fernando limongi argue that while economic development makes democracies less likely to turn authoritarian there is insufficient evidence to conclude that development causes democratization turning an authoritarian state into a democracy 91 31 93 eva bellin argues that under certain circumstances the bourgeoise and labor are more likely to favor democratization but less so under other circumstances 91 32 93 economic development can boost public support for authoritarian regimes in the short to medium term 91 33 93 according to michael albertus most land reform programs tend to be implemented by authoritarian regimes that subsequently withhold property rights from the beneficiaries of the land reform authoritarian regimes do so to gain coercive leverage over rural populations 91 34 93 institutions within authoritarian systems there may be nominally democratic institutions such as political parties legislatures 91 35 93 and elections 91 36 93 but they are managed in a way so as to entrench authoritarian regimes 91 37 93 91 16 93 within democracies parties serve to coordinate the pursuit of interests for like minded citizens whereas in authoritarian systems they are a way for authoritarian leaders to find capable elites for the regime 91 16 93 in a democracy a legislature is intended to represent the diversity of interests among citizens whereas authoritarians use legislatures to signal their own restraint towards other elites as well as to monitor other elites who pose a challenge to the regime 91 16 93 fraudulent elections may serve the role of signaling the strength of the regime to deter elites from challenging the regime and forcing other elites to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime by contrast in democracies free and fair elections are used to select representatives who represent the will of the citizens 91 16 93 91 37 93 elections may also motivate authoritarian party members to strengthen patron client and information gathering networks which strengthens the authoritarian regime 91 37 93 91 38 93 91 39 93 elections may also motivate members of the ruling class to provide public goods 91 40 93 91 41 93 according to a 2018 study most party led dictatorships regularly hold popular elections prior to the 1990s most of these elections had no alternative parties or candidates for voters to choose since the end of the cold war about two thirds of elections in authoritarian systems allow for some opposition but the elections are structured in a way to heavily favor the incumbent authoritarian regime 91 37 93 hindrances to free and fair elections in authoritarian systems may include 91 37 93 control of the media by the authoritarian incumbents interference with opposition campaigning electoral fraud violence against opposition large scale spending by the state in favor of the incumbents permitting of some parties but not others prohibitions on opposition parties but not independent candidates allowing competition between candidates within the incumbent party but not those who are not in the incumbent party interactions with other elites and the masses the foundations of stable authoritarian rule are that the authoritarian prevents contestation from the masses and other elites the authoritarian regime may use co optation or repression or carrots and sticks to prevent revolts 91 42 93 91 43 93 authoritarian rule entails a balancing act whereby the ruler has to maintain the support of other elites frequently through the distribution of state and societal resources and the support of the public through distribution of the same resources the authoritarian rule is at risk if the balancing act is lopsided as it risks a coup by the elites or an uprising by the mass public 91 44 93 91 45 93 manipulation of information according to a 2019 study by sergei guriev and daniel treisman authoritarian regimes have over time become less reliant on violence and mass repression to maintain control the study shows instead that authoritarians have increasingly resorted to manipulation of information as a means of control authoritarians increasingly seek to create an appearance of good performance conceal state repression and imitate democracy 91 46 93 systemic weakness and resilience andrew j nathan notes that regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy overreliance on coercion over centralization of decision making and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms few authoritarian regimes be they communist fascist corporatist or personalist have managed to conduct orderly peaceful timely and stable successions 91 47 93 political scientist theodore m vestal writes that authoritarian political systems may be weakened through inadequate responsiveness to either popular or elite demands and that the authoritarian tendency to respond to challenges by exerting tighter control instead of by adapting may compromise the legitimacy of an authoritarian state and lead to its collapse 91 18 93 one exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the chinese communist party which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors such as 1 the increasingly norm bound nature of its succession politics 2 the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites 3 the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime and 4 the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the ccp s legitimacy among the public at large 91 47 93 violence yale university political scientist milan svolik argues that violence is a common characteristic of authoritarian systems violence tends to be common in authoritarian states because of a lack of independent third parties empowered to settle disputes between the dictator regime allies regime soldiers and the masses 91 42 93 authoritarians may resort to measures referred to as coup proofing structures that make it hard for any small group to seize power coup proofing strategies include strategically placing family ethnic and religious groups in the military creating of an armed force parallel to the regular military and developing multiple internal security agencies with overlapping jurisdiction that constantly monitor one another 91 48 93 research shows that some coup proofing strategies reduce the risk of coups occurring 91 49 93 91 50 93 and reduce the likelihood of mass protests 91 51 93 however coup proofing reduces military effectiveness 91 52 93 91 53 93 91 54 93 91 55 93 and limits the rents that an incumbent can extract 91 56 93 a 2016 study shows that the implementation of succession rules reduce the occurrence of coup attempts 91 57 93 succession rules are believed to hamper coordination efforts among coup plotters by assuaging elites who have more to gain by patience than by plotting 91 57 93 according to political scientists curtis bell and jonathan powell coup attempts in neighbouring countries lead to greater coup proofing and coup related repression in a region 91 58 93 a 2017 study finds that countries coup proofing strategies are heavily influenced by other countries with similar histories 91 59 93 a 2018 study in the journal of peace research found that leaders who survive coup attempts and respond by purging known and potential rivals are likely to have longer tenures as leaders 91 60 93 a 2019 study in conflict management and peace science found that personalist dictatorships are more likely to take coup proofing measures than other authoritarian regimes the authors argue that this is because personalists are characterized by weak institutions and narrow support bases a lack of unifying ideologies and informal links to the ruler 91 61 93 according to a 2019 study personalist dictatorships are more repressive than other forms of dictatorship 91 62 93 typologies according to yale professor juan jos linz there a three main types of political regimes today democracies totalitarian regimes and sitting between these two authoritarian regimes with hybrid regimes 91 63 93 91 64 93 similar terms an authoritarian regime has a concentration of power in a leader or an elite not constitutionally responsible to the people 91 65 93 unlike totalitarian states they will allow social and economic institutions not under governmental control 91 66 93 and tend to rely on passive mass acceptance rather than active popular support 91 67 93 an autocracy is a state government in which one person possesses unlimited power a totalitarian state is based on subordination of the individual to the state and strict control of all aspects of the life and productive capacity of the nation especially by coercive measures such as censorship and terrorism 91 68 93 and are ruled by a single ruling party made up of loyal supporters 91 69 93 unlike autocracies which seek only to gain absolute political power and to outlaw opposition 91 70 93 totalitarian states are characterized by an official ideology which seek only to gain absolute political power and to outlaw opposition 91 70 93 and seek to dominate every aspect of everyone s life as a prelude to world domination 91 70 93 a fascist state is autocratic and based on a political philosophy movement such as that of the fascisti of pre wwii italy that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition 91 71 93 subtypes several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by linz and others 91 72 93 linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic military authoritarian regimes traditional authoritarian regimes are those in which the ruling authority generally a single person is maintained in power through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy patron client ties and repression which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties an example is ethiopia under haile selassie i 91 72 93 honoring south korean president park chung hee in army parade at armed forces day on 1 october 1973 bureaucratic military authoritarian regimes are those governed by a coalition of military officers and technocrats who act pragmatically rather than ideologically within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality 91 72 93 mark j gasiorowski suggests that it is best to distinguish simple military authoritarian regimes from bureaucratic authoritarian regimes in which a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy such south korea under park chung hee 91 72 93 according to barbara geddes there are seven typologies of authoritarian regimes dominant party regimes military regime personalist regimes monarchies oligarchic regimes indirect military regimes or hybrids of the first three 91 73 93 subtypes of authoritarian regimes identified by linz are corporatist or organic statistic racial and ethnic democracy and post totalitarian 91 72 93 corporatist authoritarian regimes are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups this type has been studied most extensively in latin america 91 72 93 racial and ethnic democracies are those in which certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights such as in south africa under apartheid 91 72 93 post totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions such as the party secret police and state controlled mass media 91 74 93 remain but where ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization repression has declined the state s top leadership is less personalized and more secure and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially 91 72 93 examples include the russian federation and soviet eastern bloc states in the mid 1980s 91 72 93 the post mao zedong people s republic of china was viewed as post totalitarian in the 1990s and early 2000s with a limited degree of increase in pluralism and civil society 91 75 93 91 76 93 however in the 2010s particularly after xi jinping succeeded as general secretary of the chinese communist party and rose to power in 2012 chinese state repression sharply increased aided by digital control and mass surveillance 91 77 93 91 78 93 91 79 93 azerbaijan s president ilham aliyev and venezuela s president nicolas maduro on 25 october 2019 authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or populist 91 72 93 personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and authority exercised mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules 91 72 93 personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post colonial africa by contrast populist authoritarian regimes are mobilizational regimes in which a strong charismatic manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower class groups 91 72 93 examples include argentina under juan per n 91 72 93 egypt under gamal abdel nasser 91 72 93 and venezuela under hugo ch vez and nicol s maduro 91 80 93 91 81 93 a typology of authoritarian regimes by political scientists brian lai and dan slater includes four categories machine oligarchic party dictatorships bossism autocratic party dictatorships juntas oligarchic military dictatorships and strongman autocratic military dictatorships 91 4 93 lai and slater argue that single party regimes are better than military regimes at developing institutions e g mass mobilization patronage networks ad coordination of elites that are effective at continuing the regime s incumbency and diminishing domestic challengers lai and slater also argue that military regimes more often initiate military conflicts or undertake other desperate measures to maintain control as compared to single party regimes 91 4 93 91 3 93 john duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and collectivism asserting that both stand in opposition to individualism 91 82 93 duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge individual rights and goals to group goals expectations and conformities 91 83 93 according to steven levitsky and lucan way authoritarian regimes that are created in social revolutions are far more durable than other kinds of authoritarian regimes 91 84 93 authoritarianism and democracy democracy index by the economist intelligence unit 2020 91 85 93 green countries are democratic yellow are hybrid regimes and red are authoritarian governments authoritarianism and democracy are not necessarily fundamental opposites and may be thought of as poles at opposite ends of a scale so that it is possible for some democracies to possess authoritarian elements and for an authoritarian system to have democratic elements 91 86 93 91 87 93 91 88 93 authoritarian regimes may also be partly responsive to citizen grievances although this is generally only regarding grievances that do not undermine the stability of the regime 91 89 93 91 90 93 an illiberal democracy or procedural democracy is distinguished from liberal democracy or substantive democracy in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the rule of law protections for minority groups an independent judiciary and the real separation of powers 91 91 93 91 92 93 91 93 93 91 94 93 a further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars sometimes called militarized interstate disputes causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer civil wars 91 95 93 91 96 93 research shows that the democratic nations have much less democide or murder by government those were also moderately developed nations before applying liberal democratic policies 91 97 93 research by the world bank suggests that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of corruption and that parliamentary systems political stability and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption 91 98 93 a 2006 study by economist alberto abadie has concluded that terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom the nations with the least terrorism are the most and least democratic nations and that transitions from an authoritarian regime to a democracy may be accompanied by temporary increases in terrorism 91 99 93 studies in 2013 and 2017 similarly found a nonlinear relationship between political freedom and terrorism with the most terrorist attacks occurring in partial democracies and the fewest in strict autocracies and full fledged democracies 91 100 93 a 2018 study by amichai magen demonstrated that liberal democracies and polyarchies not only suffer fewer terrorist attacks as compared to other regime types but also suffer fewer casualties in terrorist attacks as compared to other regime types which may be attributed to higher quality democracies responsiveness to their citizens demands including the desire for physical safety resulting in investment in intelligence infrastructure protection first responders social resilience and specialized medical care which averts casualties 91 100 93 magen also stated that terrorism in closed autocracies sharply increased starting in 2013 91 100 93 within national democratic governments there may be subnational authoritarian enclaves a prominent examples of this includes the southern united states after reconstruction as well as areas of contemporary argentina and mexico 91 101 93 competitive authoritarian regimes another type of authoritarian regime is the competitive authoritarian regime a type of civilian regime that arose in the post cold war era in a competitive authoritarian regime formal democratic institutions exist and are widely viewed as the primary means of gaining power but incumbents abuse of the state places them at a significant advantage vis vis their opponents 91 102 93 91 103 93 the term was coined by steven levitsky and lucan a way in their 2010 book of the same name to discuss a type of hybrid regime that emerged during and after the cold war 91 102 93 91 104 93 competitive authoritarian regimes differ from fully authoritarian regimes in that elections are regularly held the opposition can openly operate without a high risk of exile or imprisonment and democratic procedures are sufficiently meaningful for opposition groups to take them seriously as arenas through which to contest for power 91 102 93 competitive authoritarian regimes lack one or more of the three characteristics of democracies such as free elections i e elections untainted by substantial fraud or voter intimidation protection of civil liberties i e the freedom of speech press and association and an even playing field in terms of access to resources the media and legal recourse 91 105 93 authoritarianism and fascism authoritarianism is considered a core concept of fascism 91 106 93 91 107 93 91 108 93 91 109 93 and scholars agree that a fascist regime is foremost an authoritarian form of government although not all authoritarian regimes are fascist while authoritarianism is a defining characteristic of fascism scholars argue that more distinguishing traits are needed to make an authoritarian regime fascist 91 110 93 91 111 93 91 112 93 91 113 93 91 114 93 91 115 93 91 116 93 91 117 93 91 118 93 authoritarianism and totalitarianism benito mussolini the founder of italian fascism called his regime the totalitarian state everything in the state nothing outside the state nothing against the state 91 119 93 linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states taking francoist spain as an example unlike personalistic dictatorships new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors in spain s case including the military the catholic church falange monarchists technocrats and others unlike totalitarian states the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support 91 67 93 according to juan linz the distinction between an authoritarian regime and a totalitarian one is that an authoritarian regime seeks to suffocate politics and political mobilization while totalitarianism seeks to control and utilize them 91 63 93 authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control building on the work of yale political scientist juan linz paul c sondrol of the university of colorado at colorado springs has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart 91 66 93 totalitarianism authoritarianism charisma high low role conception leader as function leader as individual ends of power public private corruption low high official ideology yes no limited pluralism no yes legitimacy yes no sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of autocracy they differ in three key dichotomies 1 unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren totalitarian dictators develop a charismatic mystique and a mass based pseudo democratic interdependence with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image 2 concomitant role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo totalitarian self conceptions are largely teleological the tyrant is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe 3 consequently the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians lacking the binding appeal of ideology authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators engendering a kleptocracy 91 66 93 compared to totalitarianism the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society it is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty totalitarianism on the other hand invades private life and asphyxiates it 91 120 93 another distinction is that authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is it does not attempt to change the world and human nature 91 120 93 carl joachim friedrich writes that a totalist ideology a party reinforced by a secret police and monopoly control of industrial mass society are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies 91 120 93 greg yudin a professor of political philosophy at the moscow school of social and economic sciences argues political passivity and civic disengagement are key features of authoritarianism while totalitarianism relies on mass mobilization terror and homogeneity of beliefs 91 121 93 economic effects the effects of political regime types on economic growth have been debated by scholars a 1993 assessment of existing scholarship led adam przeworski and fernando limongi to conclude we do not know whether democracy fosters or hinders economic growth 91 122 93 in 2010 dani rodrik wrote that democracies outperform autocracies in terms of long term economic growth economic stability adjustments to external economic shocks human capital investment and economic equality 91 123 93 a 2019 study by daron acemoglu suresh naidu pascual restrepo and james a robinson found that democracy increases gdp per capita by about 20 percent over the long term 91 124 93 according to amartya sen no functioning liberal democracy has ever suffered a large scale famine 91 125 93 scholars have identified that autocracies may have an advantage when it comes to rapid industrialization 91 126 93 seymour martin lipset argued that low income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic efficiency enhancing advantages over low income democracies that gives authoritarian regimes an advantage in economic development 91 127 93 by contrast morton h halperin joseph t siegle and michael m weinstein 2005 argue that democracies realize superior development performance over authoritarianism pointing out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes such as refugee crises than authoritarian regimes that civil liberties in democracies act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources and that democracies are more adaptable than authoritarian regimes 91 127 93 studies suggest that several health indicators life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with gdp per capita size of the public sector or income inequality 91 128 93 historical trends post world war ii anti authoritarianism main article anti authoritarianism both world war ii ending in 1945 and the cold war ending in 1991 resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian world war ii saw the defeat of the axis powers by the allied powers all the axis powers nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan had totalitarian or authoritarian governments and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions the allied powers were an alliance of democratic states and later the communist soviet union at least in western europe the initial post war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes the memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated the new federal republic of germany banned its expression in reaction to the centralism of the nazi state the new constitution of west germany federal republic of germany exercised separation of powers and placed law enforcement firmly in the hands of the sixteen l nder or states of the republic not with the federal german government at least not at first 91 129 93 culturally there was also a strong sense of anti authoritarianism based on anti fascism in western europe this was attributed to the active resistance from occupation and to fears arising from the development of superpowers 91 130 93 anti authoritarianism also became associated with countercultural and bohemian movements such as the beat generation in the 1950s 91 131 93 the hippies in the 1960s 91 132 93 and punks in the 1970s 91 133 93 in south america argentina bolivia brazil paraguay chile and uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990 91 134 93 with the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the soviet union in 1991 the other authoritarian totalitarian half of the allied powers of world war ii collapsed this led not so much to revolt against authority in general but to the belief that authoritarian states and state control of economies were outdated 91 135 93 the idea that liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed 91 136 93 became very popular in western countries and was celebrated in francis fukuyama s book the end of history and the last man 91 136 93 according to charles h fairbanks jr all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the soviet bloc except uzbekistan and turkmenistan seemed indeed to be moving towards democracy in the early 1990s as were the countries of east central europe and the balkans 91 137 93 in december 2010 the arab spring arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes first in tunisia and spreading to libya egypt yemen syria bahrain and elsewhere regimes were toppled in tunisia libya egypt and partially in yemen while other countries saw riots civil wars or insurgencies most arab spring revolutions failed to lead to enduring democratization in the decade following the arab spring of the countries in which an autocracy was toppled in the arab spring only tunisia had become a genuine democracy
