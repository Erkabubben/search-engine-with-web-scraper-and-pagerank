diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search american psychiatric classification and diagnostic guide 1952 edition of the dsm dsm 1 the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm latest edition dsm 5 tr published in march 2022 91 1 93 is a publication by the american psychiatric association apa for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria and is the main book for the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders in the united states and is considered one of the bibles of psychiatry along with the icd ccmd and the psychodynamic diagnostic manual it is used 160 8211 32 mainly in the united states 160 8211 32 by researchers psychiatric drug regulation agencies health insurance companies pharmaceutical companies the legal system and policymakers mental health professionals use the manual to determine and help communicate a patient s diagnosis after an evaluation hospitals clinics and insurance companies in the united states may require a dsm diagnosis for all patients with mental disorders health care researchers use the dsm to categorize patients for research purposes the dsm evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics as well as from a united states army manual revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders recent editions of the dsm have received praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnosis grounded in empirical evidence as opposed to the theory bound nosology the branch of medical science that deals with the classification of diseases used in dsm iii however it has also generated controversy and criticism including ongoing questions concerning the reliability and validity of many diagnoses the use of arbitrary dividing lines between mental illness and normality possible cultural bias and the medicalization of human distress 91 2 93 91 3 93 91 4 93 91 5 93 91 6 93 contents 1 distinction from icd 2 pre dsm 1 1840 1949 2 1 census office and ama

alternate widely used classification publication is the international classification of diseases icd is produced by the world health organization who 91 7 93 the icd has a broader scope than the dsm covering overall health as well as mental health chapter 5 of the icd specifically covers mental and behavioral disorders moreover while the dsm is the most popular diagnostic system for mental disorders in the us the icd is used more widely in europe and other parts of the world giving it a far larger reach than the dsm an international survey of psychiatrists in sixty six countries compared the use of the icd 10 and dsm iv it found the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was more valued for research 91 8 93 this may be because the dsm tends to put more emphasis on clear diagnostic criteria while the icd tends to put more emphasis on clinician judgement and avoiding diagnostic criteria unless they are independently validated that is the icd descriptions of psychiatric disorders tend to be more qualitative information such as general descriptions of what various disorders tend to look like the dsm focuses more on quantitative and operationalized criteria e g to be diagnosed with x disorder one must fulfill 5 of 9 criteria for at least 6 months 91 9 93 the dsm iv tr 4th ed contains specific codes allowing comparisons between the dsm and the icd manuals which may not systematically match because revisions are not simultaneously coordinated 91 10 93 though recent editions of the dsm and icd have become more similar due to collaborative agreements each one contains information absent from the other 91 11 93 for instance the two manuals contain overlapping but substantially different lists of recognized culture bound syndromes 91 12 93 the icd also tends to focus more on primary care and low and middle income countries as opposed to the dsm s focus on secondary psychiatric care in high income countries 91 9 93 pre dsm 1 1840 1949 edit census office and ama 1840 1911 edit the initial impetus for developing a classification of mental disorders in the united states was the need to collect statistical information the first official attempt was the 1840 census which used a single category idiocy insanity three years later the american statistical association made an official protest to the u s house of representatives stating that the most glaring and remarkable errors are found in the statements respecting nosology prevalence of insanity blindness deafness and dumbness among the people of this nation pointing out that in many towns african americans were all marked as insane and calling the statistics essentially useless 91 13 93 the association of medical superintendents of american institutions for the insane the superintendents association was formed in 1844 91 14 93 edward jarvis and later francis amasa walker helped expand the census from two volumes in 1870 to twenty five volumes in 1880 91 15 93 in 1872 the american medical association ama published its nomenclature of diseases which included various disorders of the intellect 91 16 93 it s use was short lived however 91 17 93 in 1888 the census office published frederick h wines 582 page volume called report on the defective dependent and delinquent classes of the population of the united states as returned at the tenth census june 1 1880 wines used seven categories of mental illness which were also adopted by the superintendents dementia dipsomania uncontrollable craving for alcohol epilepsy mania melancholia monomania and paresis 91 18 93 in 1892 the superintendents association expanded it s membership to include other mental health workers and renamed to the american medico psychological association ampa 91 19 93 in 1903 new york s bellevue hospital published the bellevue hospital nomenclature of diseases and conditions which included a section on diseases of the mind revisions were released in 1909 and 1911 it was produced with the assistance of the ama and bureau of the census 91 20 93 apa manual for mental hospitals 1917 edit in 1917 together with the national commission on mental hygiene now mental health america the american medico psychological association developed a new guide for mental hospitals called the statistical manual for the use of institutions for the insane this guide included twenty two diagnoses it would be revised several times by the association and its successor the american psychiatric association apa and by the tenth edition in 1942 was titled statistical manual for the use of hospitals of mental diseases 91 21 93 91 22 93 in 1921 ampa became the present american psychiatric association apa 91 23 93 in 1933 the ama s general medical guide the standard classified nomenclature of disease referred to as the standard was released 91 24 93 along with the new york academy of medicine the apa provided the psychiatric nomenclature subsection 91 25 93 a number of revisions were produced with the last in 1961 91 26 93 medical 203 1945 edit world war ii saw the large scale involvement of u s psychiatrists in the selection processing assessment and treatment of soldiers 91 27 93 this moved the focus away from mental institutions and traditional clinical perspectives under the direction of james forrestal 91 28 93 a committee headed by psychiatrist brigadier general william c menninger with the assistance of the mental hospital service 91 29 93 developed a new classification scheme in 1944 and 1945 issued in war department technical bulletin medical 203 tb med 203 nomenclature and method of recording diagnoses was released shortly after the war in october 1945 under the auspices of the office of the surgeon general 91 30 93 it was reprinted in the journal of clinical psychology for civilian use in july 1946 with the new title nomenclature of psychiatric disorders and reactions 91 31 93 this system came to be known as medical 203 the foreword to the dsm i states the united states navy had itself made some minor revisions but the army established a much more sweeping revision abandoning the basic outline of the standard and attempting to express present day concepts of mental disturbance this nomenclature eventually was adopted by all the armed forces and assorted modifications of the armed forces nomenclature were introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty the veterans administration also adopted a slightly modified version of the standard in 1947 91 28 93 the further developed joint armed forces nomenclature and method of recording psychiatric conditions was released in 1949 91 32 93 icd 6 1949 edit in 1949 the world health organization published the sixth revision of the international statistical classification of diseases icd which included a section on mental disorders for the first time 91 33 93 the foreword to dsm 1 states this categorized mental disorders in rubrics similar to those of the armed forces nomenclature early versions 20th century edit dsm 1 1952 edit the apa committee on nomenclature and statistics was empowered to develop a version of medical 203 specifically for use in the united states to standardize the diverse and confused usage of different documents in 1950 the apa committee undertook a review and consultation it circulated an adaptation of medical 203 the standard 39 s nomenclature and the va system s modifications of the standard to approximately 10 of apa members 46 of members replied with 93 approving the changes after some further revisions resulting in its being called dsm i the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders was approved in 1951 and published in 1952 the structure and conceptual framework were the same as in medical 203 and many passages of text were identical 91 30 93 the manual was 130 pages long and listed 106 mental disorders 91 34 93 these included several categories of personality disturbance generally distinguished from neurosis nervousness egodystonic 91 35 93 in 1952 the apa listed homosexuality in the dsm as a sociopathic personality disturbance homosexuality a psychoanalytic study of male homosexuals a large scale 1962 study of homosexuality by irving bieber and other authors was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent child relationships this view was influential in the medical profession 91 36 93 in 1956 however the psychologist evelyn hooker performed a study comparing the happiness and well adjusted nature of self identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference 91 36 93 her study stunned the medical community and made her a heroine to many gay men and lesbians 91 37 93 but homosexuality remained in the dsm until may 1974 91 38 93 dsm ii 1968 edit in the 1960s there were many challenges to the concept of mental illness itself these challenges came from psychiatrists like thomas szasz who argued mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts from sociologists such as erving goffman who said mental illness was another example of how society labels and controls non conformists from behavioural psychologists who challenged psychiatry s fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena and from gay rights activists who criticised the apa s listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder a study published in science the rosenhan experiment received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis 91 39 93 the apa was closely involved in the next significant revision of the mental disorder section of the icd version 8 in 1968 it decided to go ahead with a revision of the dsm which was published in 1968 dsm ii was similar to dsm i listed 182 disorders and was 134 pages long the term reaction was dropped but the term neurosis was retained both the dsm i and the dsm ii reflected the predominant psychodynamic psychiatry 91 40 93 although both manuals also included biological perspectives and concepts from kraepelin s system of classification symptoms were not specified in detail for specific disorders many were seen as reflections of broad underlying conflicts or maladaptive reactions to life problems that were rooted in a distinction between neurosis and psychosis roughly anxiety depression broadly in touch with reality as opposed to hallucinations or delusions disconnected from reality sociological and biological knowledge was incorporated under a model that did not emphasize a clear boundary between normality and abnormality 91 41 93 the idea that personality disorders did not involve emotional distress was discarded 91 35 93 an influential 1974 paper by robert spitzer and joseph l fleiss demonstrated that the second edition of the dsm dsm ii was an unreliable diagnostic tool 91 42 93 spitzer and fleiss found that different practitioners using the dsm ii rarely agreed when diagnosing patients with similar problems in reviewing previous studies of eighteen major diagnostic categories spitzer and fleiss concluded that there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high reliability appears to be only satisfactory for three categories mental deficiency organic brain syndrome but not its subtypes and alcoholism the level of reliability is no better than fair for psychosis and schizophrenia and is poor for the remaining categories 91 43 93 seventh printing of the dsm ii 1974 edit as described by ronald bayer a psychiatrist and gay rights activist specific protests by gay rights activists against the apa began in 1970 when the organization held its convention in san francisco the activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1971 gay rights activist frank kameny worked with the gay liberation front collective to demonstrate at the apa s convention at the 1971 conference kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled psychiatry is the enemy incarnate psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us you may take this as a declaration of war against you 91 44 93 this gay activism occurred in the context of a broader anti psychiatry movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis anti psychiatry activists protested at the same apa conventions with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations as gay activists 91 45 93 91 46 93 taking into account data from researchers such as alfred kinsey and evelyn hooker the seventh printing of the dsm ii in 1974 no longer listed homosexuality as a category of disorder 91 a 93 after a vote by the apa trustees in 1973 and confirmed by the wider apa membership in 1974 the diagnosis was replaced with the category of sexual orientation disturbance 91 47 93 91 48 93 dsm iii 1980 edit in 1974 the decision to create a new revision of the dsm was made and robert spitzer was selected as chairman of the task force the initial impetus was to make the dsm nomenclature consistent with that of the international classification of diseases icd the revision took on a far wider mandate under the influence and control of spitzer and his chosen committee members 91 49 93 one added goal was to improve the uniformity and validity of psychiatric diagnosis in the wake of a number of critiques including the famous rosenhan experiment there was also felt a need to standardize diagnostic practices within the united states and with other countries after research showed that psychiatric diagnoses differed between europe and the united states 91 50 93 the establishment of consistent criteria was an attempt to facilitate the pharmaceutical regulatory process the criteria adopted for many of the mental disorders were taken from the research diagnostic criteria rdc and feighner criteria which had just been developed by a group of research orientated psychiatrists based primarily at washington university in st louis and the new york state psychiatric institute other criteria and potential new categories of disorder were established by consensus during meetings of the committee chaired by spitzer a key aim was to base categorization on colloquial english which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices rather than by assumption of cause although its categorical approach still assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology an approach described as neo kraepelinian the psychodynamic or physiologic view was abandoned in favor of a regulatory or legislative model a new multiaxial system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a statistical population census rather than a simple diagnosis spitzer argued mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders but the task force decided on this statement for the dsm each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome 91 40 93 personality disorders were placed on axis ii along with mental retardation 91 35 93 the first draft of dsm iii was ready within a year it introduced many new categories of disorder while deleting or changing others a number of unpublished documents discussing and justifying the changes have recently come to light 91 51 93 field trials sponsored by the u s national institute of mental health nimh were conducted between 1977 and 1979 to test the reliability of the new diagnoses a controversy emerged regarding deletion of the concept of neurosis a mainstream of psychoanalytic theory and therapy but seen as vague and unscientific by the dsm task force faced with enormous political opposition dsm iii was in serious danger of not being approved by the apa board of trustees unless neurosis was included in some form a political compromise reinserted the term in parentheses after the word disorder in some cases additionally the diagnosis of ego dystonic homosexuality replaced the dsm ii category of sexual orientation disturbance the gender identity disorder in children gidc diagnosis was introduced in the dsm iii prior to the dsm iii s publication in 1980 there was no diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria 91 52 93 91 53 93 finally published in 1980 dsm iii listed 265 diagnostic categories and was 494 pages long it rapidly came into widespread international use and has been termed a revolution or transformation in psychiatry 91 40 93 91 41 93 when dsm iii was published the developers made extensive claims about the reliability of the radically new diagnostic system they had devised which relied on data from special field trials however according to a 1994 article by stuart a kirk twenty years after the reliability problem became the central focus of dsm iii there is still not a single multi site study showing that dsm any version is routinely used with high reliably by regular mental health clinicians nor is there any credible evidence that any version of the manual has greatly increased its reliability beyond the previous version there are important methodological problems that limit the generalizability of most reliability studies each reliability study is constrained by the training and supervision of the interviewers their motivation and commitment to diagnostic accuracy their prior skill the homogeneity of the clinical setting in regard to patient mix and base rates and the methodological rigor achieved by the investigator 91 39 93 dsm iii r 1987 edit in 1987 dsm iii r was published as a revision of the dsm iii under the direction of spitzer categories were renamed and reorganized with significant changes in criteria six categories were deleted while others were added controversial diagnoses such as pre menstrual dysphoric disorder and masochistic personality disorder were considered and discarded ego dystonic homosexuality was also removed and was largely subsumed under sexual disorder not otherwise specified which could include persistent and marked distress about one s sexual orientation 91 40 93 91 54 93 altogether the dsm iii r contained 292 diagnoses and was 567 pages long further efforts were made for the diagnoses to be purely descriptive although the introductory text stated for at least some disorders particularly the personality disorders the criteria require much more inference on the part of the observer p xxiii 91 35 93 dsm iv 1994 edit in 1994 dsm iv was published listing 410 disorders in 886 pages the task force was chaired by allen frances and was overseen by a steering committee of twenty seven people including four psychologists the steering committee created thirteen work groups of five to sixteen members each work group having about twenty advisers in addition the work groups conducted a three step process first each group conducted an extensive literature review of their diagnoses then they requested data from researchers conducting analyses to determine which criteria required change with instructions to be conservative finally they conducted multi center field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice 91 55 93 91 56 93 a major change from previous versions was the inclusion of a clinical significance criterion to almost half of all the categories which required symptoms causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning some personality disorder diagnoses were deleted or moved to the appendix 91 35 93 further information can be found in the journal of personality and mental health 91 citation needed 93 dsm iv definitions edit see also dsm iv codes the dsm iv characterizes a mental disorder as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significant increased risk of suffering death pain disability or an important loss of freedom 91 57 93 it also notes that although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of mental disorder 91 58 93 dsm iv categorization edit the dsm iv is a categorical classification system the categories are prototypes and a patient with a close approximation to the prototype is said to have that disorder dsm iv states there is no assumption each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries but isolated low grade and non criterion unlisted for a given disorder symptoms are not given importance 91 59 93 qualifiers are sometimes used for example to specify mild moderate or severe forms of a disorder for nearly half the disorders symptoms must be sufficient to cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning although dsm iv tr removed the distress criterion from tic disorders and several of the paraphilias due to their egosyntonic nature each category of disorder has a numeric code taken from the icd coding system used for health service including insurance administrative purposes dsm iv multi axial system edit the dsm iv was organized into a five part axial system axis i provided information about clinical disorders or any mental condition other than personality disorders and what was referred to in dsm editions prior to dsm v as mental retardation those were both covered on axis ii axis iii covered medical conditions that could impact a person s disorder or treatment of a disorder and axis iv covered psychosocial and environmental factors affecting the person axis v was the gaf or global assessment of functioning which was basically a numerical score between 0 and 100 that measured how much a person s psychological symptoms impacted their daily life 91 60 93 dsm iv sourcebooks edit the dsm iv does not specifically cite its sources but there are four volumes of sourcebooks intended to be apa s documentation of the guideline development process and supporting evidence including literature reviews data analyses and field trials 91 61 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 91 64 93 the sourcebooks have been said to provide important insights into the character and quality of the decisions that led to the production of dsm iv and the scientific credibility of contemporary psychiatric classification 91 65 93 91 66 93 dsm iv tr 2000 edit a text revision of dsm iv titled dsm iv tr was published in 2000 the diagnostic categories were unchanged as were the diagnostic criteria for all but 9 diagnoses 91 67 93 the majority of the text was unchanged however the text of two disorders pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and asperger s disorder had significant and or multiple changes made the definition of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified was changed back to what it was in dsm iii r and the text for asperger s disorder was practically entirely rewritten most other changes were to the associated features sections of diagnoses that contained additional information such as lab findings demographic information prevalence course also some diagnostic codes were changed to maintain consistency with icd 9 cm 91 68 93 dsm 5 2013 edit main article dsm 5 the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm the dsm 5 was approved by the board of trustees of the apa on december 1 2012 91 69 93 published on may 18 2013 91 70 93 the dsm 5 contains extensively revised diagnoses and in some cases broadens diagnostic definitions while narrowing definitions in other cases 91 71 93 the dsm 5 is the first major edition of the manual in 20 years 91 72 93 dsm 5 and the abbreviations for all previous editions are registered trademarks owned by the american psychiatric association 91 3 93 91 73 93 a significant change in the fifth edition is the deletion of the subtypes of schizophrenia paranoid disorganized catatonic undifferentiated and residual 91 74 93 the deletion of the subsets of autistic spectrum disorder 160 8211 32 namely asperger s syndrome classic autism rett syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified 160 8211 32 was also implemented with specifiers regarding intensity mild moderate and severe severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted repetitive patterns of behavior with three levels requiring support requiring substantial support requiring very substantial support during the revision process the apa website periodically listed several sections of the dsm 5 for review and discussion 91 75 93 future revisions and updates edit beginning with the fifth edition the apa communicated that they intend to add subsequent revisions more often to keep up with research in the field 91 76 93 it is notable that dsm 5 uses arabic rather than roman numerals beginning with dsm 5 the apa will use decimals to identify incremental updates e g dsm 5 1 dsm 5 2 and whole numbers for new editions e g dsm 5 dsm 6 91 77 93 similar to the scheme used for software versioning dsm 5 tr 2022 edit a revision of dsm 5 titled dsm 5 tr was published in march 2022 updating diagnostic criteria and icd 10 cm codes 91 78 93 the diagnostic criteria for avoidant restrictive food intake disorder was changed 91 79 93 along with adding entries for prolonged grief disorder unspecified mood disorder and stimulant induced mild neurocognitive disorder 91 80 93 prolonged grief disorder which had been present in the icd 11 had criteria agreed upon by consensus in a one day in person workshop sponsored by the apa 91 79 93 a 2022 study found that higher rates of diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder in the icd 11 could be explained by the dsm 5 tr criteria requiring symptoms persist for 12 months and the icd 11 requiring only 6 months 91 81 93 three review groups for sex and gender culture and suicide along with an ethnoracial equity and inclusion work group were involved in the creation of the dsm 5 tr which led to additional sections for each mental disorder discussing sex and gender racial and cultural variations and adding diagnostic codes for specifying levels of suicidality and nonsuicidal self injury for mental disorders 91 80 93 91 79 93 other changed mental disorders included 91 82 93 autism spectrum disorder bipolar i disorder bipolar ii disorder and related bipolar disorders obsessive compulsive personality disorder in the alternative dsm 5 model for personality disorders depressive episodes with short duration hypomania intellectual developmental disorder delusional disorder disruptive mood dysregulation disorder brief psychotic disorder dsm library edit the apa have supplemented the dsm with supporting works collectively forming the dsm library 91 83 93 as of 2022 the other books in the library are dsm 5 handbook of differential diagnosis dsm 5 clinical cases dsm 5 handbook on the cultural formulation interview and gu a de consulta de los criterios diagn sticos del dsm 5 91 83 93 criticisms edit there are a number of different criticisms that have been leveled against the dsm and its usefulness as a diagnostic manual reliability and validity edit the revisions of the dsm from the 3rd edition forward have been mainly concerned with diagnostic reliability 160 8211 32 the degree to which different diagnosticians agree on a diagnosis henrik walter argued that psychiatry as a science can only advance if diagnosis is reliable if clinicians and researchers frequently disagree about the diagnosis of a patient then research into the causes and effective treatments of those disorders cannot advance hence diagnostic reliability was a major concern of dsm iii when the diagnostic reliability problem was thought to be solved subsequent editions of the dsm were concerned mainly with tweaking the diagnostic criteria unfortunately neither the issue of reliability or validity was settled 91 84 93 91 85 93 in 2013 shortly before the publication of dsm 5 the director of the national institute of mental health nimh thomas r insel declared that the agency would no longer fund research projects that relied exclusively on dsm diagnostic criteria due to its lack of validity 91 86 93 insel questioned the validity of the dsm classification scheme because diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms as opposed to collecting the genetic imaging physiologic and cognitive data to see how all the data not just the symptoms cluster and how these clusters relate to treatment response 91 87 93 91 88 93 field trials of dsm 5 brought the debate of reliability back into the limelight as the diagnoses of some disorders showed poor reliability for example a diagnosis of major depressive disorder a common mental illness had a poor reliability kappa statistic of 0 28 indicating that clinicians frequently disagreed on diagnosing this disorder in the same patients the most reliable diagnosis was major neurocognitive disorder with a kappa of 0 78 91 89 93 diagnosis based on superficial symptoms edit by design the dsm is primarily concerned with the signs and symptoms of mental disorders rather than the underlying causes it claims to collect these disorders based on statistical or clinical patterns as such it has been compared to a naturalist s field guide to birds with similar advantages and disadvantages 91 90 93 the lack of a causative or explanatory basis however is not specific to the dsm but rather reflects a general lack of pathophysiological understanding of psychiatric disorders proponents argue this absence of explanatory classification is necessary but it presents a problem for researchers as it results in the grouping of individuals who may have little in common except superficial criteria 91 3 93 91 91 93 as dsm iii chief architect robert spitzer and dsm iv editor michael first outlined in 2005 little progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiological processes and cause of mental disorders if anything the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology 91 92 93 while there is generally a lack of consensus on underlying causation for most psychiatric disorders some proponents of specific psychopathological paradigms have faulted the dsm for failing to incorporate evidence from other disciplines for instance evolutionary psychology distinguishes between genuine cognitive malfunctions and malfunctions due to psychological adaptations that is learned behaviors may be adaptive in one context but maladaptive in another however this distinction is one that is challenged within general psychology 91 93 93 91 94 93 91 95 93 there is also criticism of the strong operationalist viewpoint of the dsm the dsm relies on operational definitions which means that intuitive concepts like depression are defined by specific measurable criteria observable behavior specific timelines some have argued that instead of replacing metaphysical terms like desire or purpose the dsm chose to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions however this may have served only to provide a reassurance fetish for mainstream methodological practice rather than representing a substantial and meaningful alteration of mainstream psychiatric practice 91 96 93 a central problem with the use of superficial symptoms is that psychiatry deals with the phenomena of consciousness which adds much more complexity than the somatic symptoms and signs used by most of medicine a 2013 review published in the european archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience gives the example of the problem of superficial characterization of psychiatric signs and symptoms if a patient says they feel depressed sad or down there are actually a wide variety of underlying experiences they could be referencing not only depressed mood but also for instance irritation anger loss of meaning varieties of fatigue ambivalence ruminations of different kinds hyper reflectivity thought pressure psychological anxiety varieties of depersonalization and even voices with negative content and so forth this criticism is especially pertinent to the structured interview as simple yes or no questions may not be specific enough to truly confirm or deny the diagnostic criterion at issue that is whether a patient says yes or no will rely on their own understanding of the meaning of the various words in the question as well as their own interpretation of their experience there is thus danger in being overconfident in the face value of the answers the authors of the 2013 review give an example a patient who was being administered the structured clinical interview for the dsm iv axis i disorders denied thought insertion but during a conversational phenomenological interview a semi structured interview tailored to the patient the same patient admitted to experiencing thought insertion along with a delusional elaboration the authors suggested 2 reasons for this discrepancy either the patient did not recognize his own experience in the rather blunt implicitly either or formulation of the structured interview question or the experience did not fully articulate itself until the patient started talking about his experiences 91 97 93 overdiagnosis edit allen frances an outspoken critic of dsm 5 states that normality is an endangered species because of fad diagnoses and an epidemic of over diagnosing and suggests that the dsm 5 threatens to provoke several more epidemics 91 98 93 91 99 93 some researchers state that changes in diagnostic criteria following each published version of the dsm reduce thresholds for a diagnosis which results in increases in prevalence rates for adhd and autism spectrum disorder 91 100 93 91 101 93 91 102 93 91 103 93 bruchm ller et al 2012 suggest that as a factor that may lead to overdiagnosis are situations when the clinical judgment of the diagnostician regarding a diagnosis adhd is affected by heuristics 91 101 93 dividing lines edit despite caveats in the introduction to the dsm it has long been argued that its system of classification makes unjustified categorical distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut offs between normal and abnormal a 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related dsm syndromes or between a common dsm syndrome and normality have failed 91 3 93 some argue that rather than a categorical approach a fully dimensional spectrum or complaint oriented approach would better reflect the evidence 91 104 93 91 105 93 91 106 93 in addition it is argued that the current approach based on exceeding a threshold of symptoms does not adequately take into account the context in which a person is living and to what extent there is internal disorder of an individual versus a psychological response to adverse situations 91 107 93 the dsm does include a step axis iv for outlining psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder once someone is diagnosed with that particular disorder because an individual s degree of impairment is often not correlated with symptom counts and can stem from various individual and social factors the dsm s standard of distress or disability can often produce false positives 91 108 93 on the other hand individuals who do not meet symptom counts may nevertheless experience comparable distress or disability in their life cultural bias edit psychiatrists have argued that published diagnostic standards rely on an exaggerated interpretation of neurophysiological findings and so understate the scientific importance of social psychological variables 91 109 93 advocating a more culturally sensitive approach to psychology critics such as carl bell and marcello maviglia contend that researchers and service providers often discount the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals 91 110 93 in addition current diagnostic guidelines have been criticized 91 111 93 as having a fundamentally euro american outlook although these guidelines have been widely implemented opponents argue that even when a diagnostic criterion set is accepted across different cultures it does not necessarily indicate that the underlying constructs have any validity within those cultures even reliable application can only demonstrate consistency not legitimacy 91 109 93 cross cultural psychiatrist arthur kleinman contends that western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the dsm iv the fact that disorders or concepts from non western or non mainstream cultures are described as culture bound whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever is to kleinman revelatory of an underlying assumption that western cultural phenomena are universal 91 112 93 other cross cultural critics largely share kleinman s negative view toward the culture bound syndrome common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non western mental disorders still left out and frustration that even those included were often misinterpreted or misrepresented 91 113 93 91 page 160 needed 93 mainstream psychiatrists have also been dissatisfied with these new culture bound diagnoses although not for the same reasons robert spitzer a lead architect of dsm iii has held the opinion that the addition of cultural formulations was an attempt to placate cultural critics and that they lack any scientific motivation or support spitzer also posits that the new culture bound diagnoses are rarely used in practice maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved in general the mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid cross cultural factors are either irrelevant or are only significant to specific symptom presentations 91 109 93 one result of this dissatisfaction was the development of the azibo nosology by daudi ajani ya azibo as an alternative to the dsm in treating patients of the african diaspora 91 114 93 91 115 93 91 116 93 historically the dsm tended to avoid issues involving religion the dsm 5 relaxed this attitude somewhat 91 117 93 medicalization and financial conflicts of interest edit there was extensive analysis and comment on dsm iv published in 1994 in the years leading up to the 2013 publication of dsm 5 it was alleged that the way the categories of dsm iv were structured as well as the substantial expansion of the number of categories within it represented increasing medicalization of human nature very possibly attributable to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades 91 118 93 in 2005 then apa president steven sharfstein released a statement in which he conceded that psychiatrists had allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio bio bio model 91 119 93 it was reported that of the authors who selected and defined the dsm iv psychiatric disorders roughly half had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry during the period 1989 2004 raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest the same article concluded that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong involving those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment such as schizophrenia and mood disorders where 100 of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry william glasser referred to dsm iv as having phony diagnostic categories arguing that it was developed to help psychiatrists to help them make money 91 120 93 a 2012 article in the new york times commented sharply that dsm iv then in its 18th year through copyrights held closely by the apa had earned the association over 100 160 million 91 121 93 however although the number of identified diagnoses had increased by more than 300 from 106 in dsm i to 365 in dsm iv tr psychiatrists such as zimmerman and spitzer argued that this almost entirely represented greater specification of the forms of pathology thereby allowing better grouping of similar patients 91 3 93 potential harm of labels edit a core function of the dsm is the categorization of people s experiences into diagnoses based on symptoms however there is disagreement about the use of diagnoses as labels some individuals are relieved to find they have a recognized condition that they can apply a name to and this has led to many people self diagnosing 91 122 93 others however question the accuracy of diagnosis or feel they have been given a label that invites social stigma and discrimination the terms mentalism and sanism have been used to describe such discriminatory treatment 91 123 93 diagnoses can become internalized and affect an individual s self identity and some psychotherapists have found that the healing process can be inhibited and symptoms can worsen as a result 91 124 93 some members of the psychiatric survivors movement more broadly the consumer survivor ex patient movement actively campaign against their diagnoses or the assumed implications or against the dsm system in general 91 125 93 91 126 93 additionally it has been noted that the dsm often uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a recovery model and such content can erroneously imply excess psychopathology e g multiple comorbid diagnoses or chronicity 91 126 93 critiques of dsm 5 edit psychiatrist allen frances has been critical of proposed revisions to the dsm 5 in a 2012 new york times editorial frances warned that if this dsm version is issued unamended by the apa it will medicalize normality and result in a glut of unnecessary and harmful drug prescription 91 127 93 in a december 2012 blog post on psychology today frances provides his list of dsm 5 s ten most potentially harmful changes 91 128 93 disruptive mood dysregulation disorder for temper tantrums major depressive disorder includes normal grief minor neurocognitive disorder for normal forgetfulness in old age adult attention deficit disorder encouraging psychiatric prescriptions of stimulants binge eating disorder for excessive eating autism defining the disorder more specifically possibly leading to decreased rates of diagnosis and the disruption of school services first time drug users will be lumped in with addicts behavioral addictions making a mental disorder of everything we like to do a lot generalized anxiety disorder includes everyday worries post traumatic stress disorder changes opened the gate even further to the already existing problem of misdiagnosis of ptsd in forensic settings 91 128 93 a group of 25 psychiatrists and researchers among whom were frances and thomas szasz have published debates on what they see as the six most essential questions in psychiatric diagnosis 91 129 93 are they more like theoretical constructs or more like diseases how to reach an agreed definition should the dsm 5 take a cautious or conservative approach what is the role of practical rather than scientific considerations how should it be used by clinicians or researchers is an entirely different diagnostic system required in 2011 psychologist brent robbins co authored a national letter for the society for humanistic psychology that has brought thousands into the public debate about the dsm over 15 000 individuals and mental health professionals have signed a petition in support of the letter 91 130 93 thirteen other apa divisions have endorsed the petition 91 130 93 robbins has noted that under the new guidelines certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences 91 131 93 see also edit chinese classification and diagnostic criteria of mental disorders classification of mental disorders diagnostic
