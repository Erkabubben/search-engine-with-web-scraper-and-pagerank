rational actions are those done in one s self interest legalism edit legalism is a chinese political philosophy that holds that self interest underlies human nature and therefore human behavior 91 1 93 it is axiomatic in legalism that a government can not truly be staffed by upright and trustworthy men of service because every member of the elite like any member of society will pursue their own interests and thus must be employed for their interests 91 2 93 it contends that even acts of virtue are intrinsically mercenary driven by self interest like the pursuit for a life of morality in the hopes that the resulting reputation will be convertible into abundant benefits or riches 91 3 93 in legalism a regular pattern of the natural world is that the basic nature of human beings comprises a set of interests that are primarily self regarding and not amenable to cultivation morally or otherwise 91 4 93 therefore legalists argue that political systems are only viable if it allows individuals to pursue their selfish interests exclusively in a manner that benefits rather than contradicts the needs of a state 91 2 93 conversely their concerns lie with political systems based on trust and respect for ministers and other officials rather than on impersonal norms and standards such as laws regulations and rules as these systems will result in an irresolvable power struggle 91 2 93 their sober realization herein is that administrative systems are fundamentally unable to monitor themselves in the long term despite the impersonal mode of rule because they must rely for their implementation on individuals who themselves are driven by self interest 91 2 93 legalists hold that an ideal state is not achieved through solving social problems that are fundamentally moral but that self interest such as the competing interacting interests of rulers ministers and common people is the genuine force in the world 91 5 93 they argue that people can be shaped behaviorally to yield social order if it is in the individual s own self interest to abide by the norms meaning that different interests must be aligned to each other and the social good which is most efficiently ensured if the norms are publicly and impartially enforced 91 6 93 they advocate the use of rewards and punishments as mankind reacts out of self interest to achieve a desired behavior from people 91 7 93 according to them the application of reward and punishment in a sociopolitical system is necessary to influence people s calculations and direct them towards pursuits that benefit the state 91 2 93 in psychology edit psychological concepts concerned with self interest include psychological egoism the view that humans are always motivated by self interest and narcissism which is an unhealthy self absorption due to a disturbance in the sense of self in business edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced
