disorder bpd also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder eupd 91 13 93 is a personality disorder characterized by a long term pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships distorted sense of self and strong emotional reactions 91 14 93 91 9 93 91 15 93 those affected often engage in self harm and other dangerous behaviors often due to their difficulty with returning their emotional level to a healthy or normal baseline 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 they may also struggle with a feeling of emptiness fear of abandonment and detachment from reality 91 14 93 symptoms of bpd may be triggered by events considered normal to others 91 14 93 bpd typically begins by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations 91 9 93 substance use disorders 91 19 93 depression and eating disorders are commonly associated with bpd 91 14 93 some 8 to 10 of people affected by the disorder may die by suicide 91 14 93 91 9 93 the disorder is often stigmatized in both the media and the psychiatric field and as a result is often underdiagnosed 91 20 93 the causes of bpd are unclear but seem to involve genetic neurological environmental and social factors 91 8 93 91 10 93 it occurs about five times more often in a person who has an affected close relative 91 8 93 adverse life events appear to also play a role 91 11 93 the underlying mechanism appears to involve the frontolimbic network of neurons 91 11 93 bpd is recognized by the american diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm as a personality disorder along with nine other such disorders 91 9 93 the condition and other personality disorders can be misdiagnosed as mood disorders substance use disorders or other disorders 91 9 93 bpd is typically treated with psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy cbt or dialectical behavior therapy dbt 91 8 93 dbt may reduce the risk of suicide in the disorder 91 8 93 therapy for bpd can occur one on one or in a group 91 8 93 while medications cannot cure bpd they may be used to help with the associated symptoms 91 8 93 quetiapine and ssri antidepressants remain widely prescribed for the condition though there is no evidence regarding the efficacy of ssris 91 21 93 severe cases of the disorder may require hospital care 91 8 93 about 1 6 of people have bpd in a given year with some estimates as high as 6 91 8 93 91 9 93 91 22 93 women are diagnosed about three times as often as men 91 9 93 the disorder appears to become less common among older people 91 9 93 up to half of those with bpd improve over a ten year period 91 9 93 those affected typically use a high amount of healthcare resources 91 9 93 there is an ongoing debate about the naming of the disorder especially the suitability of the word borderline the term

signs and symptoms edit one of the symptoms of bpd is an intense fear of abandonment bpd is characterized by nine signs and symptoms to be diagnosed a person must meet at least five of the following 91 24 93 frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment 91 25 93 unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships often characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation also known as splitting markedly disturbed sense of identity and distorted self image 91 8 93 impulsive or reckless behaviors e g impulsive or uncontrollable spending unsafe sex substance use disorders reckless driving binge eating 91 26 93 recurrent suicidal ideation or self harm rapidly shifting intense emotional dysregulation chronic feelings of emptiness inappropriate intense anger that can be difficult to control transient stress related paranoid or severe dissociative symptoms overall the most distinguishing symptoms of bpd are pervasive patterns of instability in interpersonal relationships and self image alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation of others along with varying moods and difficulty regulating strong emotional reactions dangerous or impulsive behavior is also correlated with the disorder other symptoms may include feeling unsure of one s identity morals and values having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed depersonalization and in moderate to severe cases stress induced breaks with reality or psychotic episodes individuals with bpd often have comorbid conditions such as depressive and bipolar disorders substance use disorders eating disorders post traumatic stress disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 91 24 93 emotions edit people with bpd may feel emotions with greater ease and depth and for a longer time than others do 91 27 93 91 28 93 a core characteristic of bpd is affective instability which generally manifests as unusually intense emotional responses to environmental triggers with a slower return to a baseline emotional state 91 29 93 91 30 93 according to marsha linehan the sensitivity intensity and duration with which people with bpd feel emotions have both positive and negative effects 91 30 93 people with bpd are often exceptionally enthusiastic idealistic joyful and loving 91 31 93 but may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions anxiety depression guilt shame worry anger etc experiencing intense grief instead of sadness shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment rage instead of annoyance and panic instead of nervousness 91 31 93 studies have shown that borderline patients experience chronic and significant emotional suffering and mental agony 91 24 93 91 32 93 people with bpd are also especially sensitive to feelings of rejection criticism isolation and perceived failure 91 33 93 before learning other coping mechanisms their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation self injury or suicidal behavior 91 34 93 they are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and since they cannot regulate them shut them down entirely since awareness would only cause further distress 91 30 93 this can be harmful since negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it 91 30 93 while emotional dysregulation is a key feature of bpd fitzpatrick et al 2022 argue that the dysregulation itself may not be unique to bpd and be shared by other disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder however their study did suggest that those with bpd may have a harder time disengaging from their negative emotions using distraction to manage their emotions and returning to a baseline emotional state 91 35 93 while people with bpd feel euphoria ephemeral or occasional intense joy they are especially prone to dysphoria a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction depression and or feelings of mental and emotional distress zanarini et al recognized four categories of dysphoria typical of this condition extreme emotions destructiveness or self destructiveness feeling fragmented or lacking identity and feelings of victimization 91 36 93 within these categories a bpd diagnosis is strongly associated with a combination of three specific states feeling betrayed feeling out of control and feeling like hurting myself 91 36 93 since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria people with bpd experience the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator 91 36 93 in addition to intense emotions people with bpd experience emotional lability changeability or fluctuation although that term suggests rapid changes between depression and elation mood swings in people with bpd more frequently involve anxiety with fluctuations between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety 91 37 93 interpersonal relationships edit people with bpd can be very sensitive to the way others treat them feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness 91 38 93 people with bpd often engage in idealization and devaluation of others alternating between high positive regard for people and great disappointment in them 91 39 93 their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment a threat of losing someone or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value this phenomenon is sometimes called splitting 91 40 93 combined with mood disturbances idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family friends and co workers 91 41 93 while strongly desiring intimacy people with bpd tend toward insecure avoidant or ambivalent or fearfully preoccupied attachment patterns in relationships 91 42 93 and often view the world as dangerous and malevolent 91 38 93 people with bpd are prone to feeling angry at members of their family and alienated from them on their part family members often feel angry and helpless at how their bpd family members relate to them 91 43 93 parents of adults with bpd are often both over involved and under involved in family interactions 91 44 93 in romantic relationships bpd is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict decreased satisfaction of romantic partners domestic abuse and unwanted pregnancy however these links may apply to personality disorders in general 91 45 93 behavior edit impulsive behavior is common including substance use disorders e g alcohol use disorder eating in excess unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners reckless spending and reckless driving 91 46 93 impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships running away and self injury 91 47 93 people with bpd might do this because it gives them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain 91 47 93 but in the long term may feel shame and guilt over consequences of this behavior 91 47 93 a cycle often begins in which people with bpd feel emotional pain engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain feel shame and guilt over their actions feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain 91 47 93 as time goes on impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain 91 47 93 self harm and suicide edit scarring as a result of self harm which is a common sign in borderline personality disorder 91 8 93 self harming or suicidal behavior is one of the core diagnostic criteria in the dsm 5 91 9 93 self harm occurs in 50 to 80 of people with bpd the most frequent method of self harm is cutting 91 48 93 bruising burning head banging or biting are also common with bpd 91 48 93 people with bpd may feel emotional relief after engaging in self harm 91 49 93 the estimation of lifetime risk of suicide among people with bpd varied depending on method of investigation between 3 and 10 91 50 93 91 43 93 91 51 93 there is evidence that men diagnosed with bpd are approximately twice as likely to die by suicide as women diagnosed with bpd 91 52 93 there is also evidence that a considerable percentage of men who die by suicide may have undiagnosed bpd 91 53 93 the reported reasons for self harm differ from the reasons for suicide attempts 91 34 93 nearly 70 of people with bpd self harm without trying to end their lives 91 54 93 reasons for self harm include expressing anger self punishment generating normal feelings often in response to dissociation and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances 91 34 93 in contrast suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others will be better off following the suicide 91 34 93 suicide and self harm are responses to feeling negative emotions 91 34 93 sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with bpd tendencies 91 55 93 sense of self edit people with bpd tend to have trouble seeing their identity clearly in particular they tend to have difficulty knowing what they value believe prefer and enjoy 91 56 93 they are often unsure about their long term goals for relationships and jobs this can cause people with bpd to feel empty and lost 91 56 93 self image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy people with bpd may base their identity on others leading to chameleon like changes in identity cognitions edit the often intense emotions people with bpd experience may make it difficult for them to concentrate 91 56 93 they may also tend to dissociate which can be thought of as an intense form of zoning out 91 57 93 others can sometimes tell when someone with bpd is dissociating because their facial or vocal expressions may become flat or expressionless or they may appear distracted and numb to emotional stimuli 91 57 93 dissociation most often occurs in response to a painful event or something that triggers the memory of a painful event it involves the mind automatically redirecting attention away from the current event or situation or blocking it out entirely this is done presumably to protect against based on similar or related past experiences what the mind perceives and forecasts as arousing intense negative emotions and unwanted behavioral impulses that the present emotive event might trigger 91 57 93 the mind s habit of suppressing and avoiding intensely painful emotions may provide some temporary feelings of relief but dissociation can also lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms while simultaneously causing the side effect of blocking out or blunting positive emotions thereby reducing the access of people with bpd to the valuable information those emotions provide information that helps to guide effective healthy decision making in daily life 91 57 93 psychotic symptoms edit though bpd is primarily seen as a disorder of emotional regulation psychotic symptoms are fairly common with an estimated 21 54 prevalence in clinical bpd populations 91 58 93 these symptoms are sometimes referred to as pseudo psychotic or psychotic like terms that suggest a distinction from those seen in primary psychotic disorders recent research however has indicated that there is more similarity between pseudo psychotic symptoms in bpd and true psychosis than originally thought 91 58 93 91 59 93 some researchers critique the concept of pseudo psychosis for on top of weak construct validity the implication that it is not true or less severe which could trivialize distress and serve as a barrier to diagnosis and treatment some researchers have suggested classifying these bpd symptoms as true psychosis or even eliminating the distinction between pseudo psychosis and true psychosis altogether 91 58 93 91 60 93 the dsm 5 recognizes transient paranoia that worsens in response to stress as a symptom of bpd 91 9 93 studies have documented both hallucinations and delusions in bpd patients who lack another diagnosis that would better account for those symptoms 91 59 93 phenomenologically research suggests that auditory verbal hallucinations found in patients with bpd cannot be reliably distinguished from those seen in schizophrenia 91 59 93 91 60 93 some researchers suggest there may be a common etiology underlying hallucinations in bpd and those in other conditions like psychotic and affective disorders 91 59 93 disability edit many people with bpd are able to work if they find appropriate jobs and their condition is not too severe people with bpd may be found to have a disability in the workplace if the condition is severe enough that the behaviors of sabotaging relationships engaging in risky behaviors or intense anger prevent the person from functioning in their job role 91 61 93 causes edit as is the case with other mental disorders the causes of bpd are complex and not fully agreed upon 91 62 93 evidence suggests that bpd and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd may be related in some way 91 63 93 most researchers agree that a history of childhood trauma can be a contributing factor 91 64 93 but less attention has historically been paid to investigating the causal roles played by congenital brain abnormalities genetics neurobiological factors and environmental factors other than trauma 91 62 93 91 65 93 genetics edit the heritability of bpd is estimated to be between 37 to 69 91 66 93 that is 37 to 69 of the variability in liability underlying bpd in the population can be explained by genetic differences twin studies may overestimate the effect of genes on variability in personality disorders due to the complicating factor of a shared family environment 91 67 93 even so the researchers of one study concluded that personality disorders seem to be more strongly influenced by genetic effects than almost any axis i disorder e g depression eating disorders and more than most broad personality dimensions 91 68 93 moreover the study found that bpd was estimated to be the third most heritable personality disorder out of the 10 personality disorders reviewed 91 68 93 twin sibling and other family studies indicate partial heritability for impulsive aggression but studies of serotonin related genes have suggested only modest contributions to behavior 91 69 93 families with twins in the netherlands were participants of an ongoing study by trull and colleagues in which 711 pairs of siblings and 561 parents were examined to identify the location of genetic traits that influenced the development of bpd 91 70 93 research collaborators found that genetic material on chromosome 9 was linked to bpd features 91 70 93 the researchers concluded that genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features 91 70 93 these same researchers had earlier concluded in a previous study that 42 of variation in bpd features was attributable to genetic influences and 58 was attributable to environmental influences 91 70 93 genes under investigation as of 2012 91 update 93 include the 7 repeat polymorphism of the dopamine d4 receptor drd4 on chromosome 11 which has been linked to disorganized attachment whilst the combined effect of the 7 repeat polymorphism and the 10 10 dopamine transporter dat genotype has been linked to abnormalities in inhibitory control both noted features of bpd 91 71 93 there is a possible connection to chromosome 5 91 72 93 brain abnormalities edit a number of neuroimaging studies in bpd have reported findings of reductions in regions of the brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion affecting the hippocampus the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala amongst other areas 91 71 93 a smaller number of studies have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of bpd patients looking specifically at neurometabolites such as n acetylaspartate creatine glutamate related compounds and choline containing compounds 91 71 93 some studies have identified increased gray matter in areas such as the bilateral supplementary motor area dentate gyrus and bilateral precuneus which extends to the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex pcc 91 73 93 the hippocampus tends to be smaller in people with bpd as it is in people with post traumatic stress disorder ptsd however in bpd unlike ptsd the amygdala also tends to be smaller 91 74 93 this unusually strong activity may explain the unusual strength and longevity of fear sadness anger and shame experienced by people with bpd as well as their heightened sensitivity to displays of these emotions in others 91 74 93 given its role in regulating emotional arousal the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with bpd experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress 91 75 93 neurobiology edit borderline personality disorder has previously been strongly associated with the occurrence of childhood trauma or ace adverse childhood experience while many psychiatric diagnoses are believed to be associated with traumatic experiences occurring during critical periods of childhood specific neurobiological factors have been identified within patients diagnosed with bpd dysregulations of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal hpa axis and cortisol levels have been intensively studied in individuals who have experienced childhood traumas and have been formally diagnosed with bpd the hpa axis functions to maintain homeostasis when the body is exposed to stressors but has been found to be dysregulated among individuals with a history of childhood abuse when the body is exposed to stress the hypothalamus specifically the paraventricular nucleus pvn releases peptides arginine vasopressin avp and corticotropin releasing factor crf when these peptides travel through the body they stimulate corticotrophic cells resulting in the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth acth binds to receptors in the adrenal cortex which stimulates the release of cortisol intracellular glucocorticoid receptor subtypes of mineralocorticoid receptor mr and low affinity type receptor gr have been found to mediate the effects of cortisol on different areas of the body while mrs have high affinity for cortisol and are highly saturated in response to stress grs have low affinity for cortisol and bind cortisol at high concentrations when an individual is exposed to a stressor 91 76 93 there have also been associations identified with fkbp5 polymorphisms rs4713902 and rs9470079 in individuals with bpd for those with bpd who have experienced childhood trauma rs3798347 t and rs10947563 a have been associated specifically in individuals with both bpd diagnosis and a history of childhood physical abuse and emotional neglect 91 76 93 hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis edit the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hpa axis regulates cortisol production which is released in response to stress cortisol production tends to be elevated in people with bpd indicating a hyperactive hpa axis in these individuals 91 77 93 this causes them to experience a greater biological stress response which might explain their greater vulnerability to irritability 91 78 93 since traumatic events can increase cortisol production and hpa axis activity one possibility is that the prevalence of higher than average activity in the hpa axis of people with bpd may simply be a reflection of the higher than average prevalence of traumatic childhood and maturational events among people with bpd 91 78 93 estrogen edit individual differences in female s estrogen cycles may be related to the expression of bpd symptoms in female patients 91 79 93 a 2003 study found that women s bpd symptoms were predicted by changes in estrogen levels throughout their menstrual cycles an effect that remained significant when the results were controlled for a general increase in negative affect 91 80 93 developmental factors edit childhood trauma edit there is a strong correlation between child abuse especially child sexual abuse and development of bpd 91 81 93 91 82 93 91 83 93 many individuals with bpd report a history of abuse and neglect as young children but causation is still debated 91 84 93 patients with bpd have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally emotionally physically or sexually abused by caregivers of either sex 91 85 93 they also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood 91 86 93 individuals with bpd were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child s physical care parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently 91 86 93 additionally women with bpd who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver or abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual abuse by a non caregiver 91 86 93 it has been suggested that children who experience chronic early maltreatment and attachment difficulties may go on to develop borderline personality disorder 91 87 93 writing in the psychoanalytic tradition otto kernberg argues that a child s failure to achieve the developmental task of psychic clarification of self and other and failure to overcome splitting might increase the risk of developing a borderline personality 91 88 93 neurological patterns edit the intensity and reactivity of a person s negative affectivity or tendency to feel negative emotions predicts bpd symptoms more strongly than does childhood sexual abuse 91 89 93 this finding differences in brain structure see brain abnormalities and the fact that some patients with bpd do not report a traumatic history 91 90 93 suggest that bpd is distinct from the post traumatic stress disorder which frequently accompanies it thus researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma research published in january 2013 by anthony ruocco at the university of toronto has highlighted two patterns of brain activity that may underlie the dysregulation of emotion indicated in this disorder 1 increased activity in the brain circuits responsible for the experience of heightened emotional pain coupled with 2 reduced activation of the brain circuits that normally regulate or suppress these generated painful emotions these two neural networks are seen to be dysfunctionally operative in the limbic system but the specific regions vary widely in individuals which calls for the analysis of more neuroimaging studies 91 91 93 also contrary to the results of earlier studies those with bpd showed less activation in the amygdala in situations of increased negative emotionality than the control group john krystal editor of the journal biological psychiatry wrote that these results added to the impression that people with borderline personality disorder are set up by their brains to have stormy emotional lives although not necessarily unhappy or unproductive lives 91 91 93 their emotional instability has been found to correlate with differences in several brain regions 91 92 93 mediating and moderating factors edit executive function edit while high rejection sensitivity is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder executive function appears to mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and bpd symptoms 91 93 93 that is a group of cognitive processes that include planning working memory attention and problem solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts bpd symptoms a 2008 study found that the relationship between a person s rejection sensitivity and bpd symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher 91 93 93 this suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of bpd 91 93 93 a 2012 study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with bpd 91 94 93 family environment edit family environment mediates the effect of child sexual abuse on the development of bpd an unstable family environment predicts the development of the disorder while a stable family environment predicts a lower risk one possible explanation is that a stable environment buffers against its development 91 95 93 self complexity edit self complexity or considering one s self to have many different characteristics may lessen the apparent discrepancy between an actual self and a desired self image higher self complexity may lead a person to desire more characteristics instead of better characteristics if there is any belief that characteristics should have been acquired these may be more likely to have been experienced as examples rather than considered as abstract qualities the concept of a norm does not necessarily involve the description of the attributes that represent the norm cognition of the norm may only involve the understanding of being like a concrete relation and not an attribute 91 96 93 thought suppression edit a 2005 study found that thought suppression or conscious attempts to avoid thinking certain thoughts mediates the relationship between emotional vulnerability and bpd symptoms 91 89 93 a later study found that the relationship between emotional vulnerability and bpd symptoms is not necessarily mediated by thought suppression however this study did find that thought suppression mediates the relationship between an invalidating environment and bpd symptoms 91 97 93 developmental theories edit marsha linehan s biosocial developmental theory of borderline personality disorder suggests that bpd emerges from the combination of an emotionally vulnerable child and an invalidating environment emotional vulnerability may consist of biological inherited factors that affect a child s temperament invalidating environments may include contexts where a child s emotions and needs are neglected ridiculed dismissed or discouraged or may include contexts of trauma and abuse linehan s theory was modified by sheila crowell who proposed that impulsivity also plays an important role in the development of bpd crowell found that children who are emotionally vulnerable and are exposed to invalidating environments are much more likely to develop bpd if they are also highly impulsive 91 98 93 both theories describe an interplay between a child s inherited personality traits and their environment for example an emotionally sensitive or impulsive child may be difficult to parent exacerbating the invalidating environment conversely invalidation can make an emotionally sensitive child more reactive and distressed diagnosis edit diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is based on a clinical assessment by a mental health professional the best method is to present the criteria of the disorder to a person and to ask them if they feel that these characteristics accurately describe them 91 43 93 actively involving people with bpd in determining their diagnosis can help them become more willing to accept it 91 43 93 some clinicians prefer not to tell people with bpd what their diagnosis is either from concern about the stigma attached to this condition or because bpd used to be considered untreatable it is usually helpful for the person with bpd to know their diagnosis 91 43 93 this helps them know that others have had similar experiences and can point them toward effective treatments 91 43 93 in general the psychological evaluation includes asking the patient about the beginning and severity of symptoms as well as other questions about how symptoms impact the patient s quality of life issues of particular note are suicidal ideations experiences with self harm and thoughts about harming others 91 99 93 diagnosis is based both on the person s report of their symptoms and on the clinician s own observations 91 99 93 additional tests for bpd can include a physical exam and laboratory tests to rule out other possible triggers for symptoms such as thyroid conditions or a substance use disorder 91 99 93 the icd 10 manual refers to the disorder as emotionally unstable personality disorder and has similar diagnostic criteria in the dsm 5 the name of the disorder remains the same as in the previous editions 91 9 93 diagnostic and statistical manual edit the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders fifth edition dsm 5 has removed the multiaxial system consequently all disorders including personality disorders are listed in section ii of the manual a person must meet five of nine criteria to receive a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder 91 100 93 the dsm 5 defines the main features of the condition as a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships self image and affect as well as markedly impulsive behavior 91 100 93 in addition the dsm 5 proposes alternative diagnostic criteria for bpd in section iii alternative dsm 5 model for personality disorders these alternative criteria are based on trait research and include specifying at least four of seven maladaptive traits 91 101 93 according to marsha linehan many mental health professionals find it challenging to diagnose bpd using the dsm criteria since these criteria describe such a wide variety of behaviors 91 102 93 to address this issue linehan has grouped the symptoms of bpd under five main areas of dysregulation emotions behavior interpersonal relationships sense of self and cognition 91 102 93 international classification of disease edit the world health organization s icd 10 defines a disorder that is conceptually similar to bpd called f60 3 emotionally unstable personality disorder its two subtypes are described below 91 103 93 f60 30 impulsive type edit at least three of the following must be present one of which must be 2 marked tendency to act unexpectedly and without consideration of the consequences marked tendency to engage in quarrelsome behavior and to have conflicts with others especially when impulsive acts are thwarted or criticized liability to outbursts of anger or violence with inability to control the resulting behavioral explosions difficulty in maintaining any course of action that offers no immediate reward unstable and

describes some general criteria that define what is considered a personality disorder millon s subtypes edit american psychologist theodore millon has proposed four subtypes of bpd he suggests that an individual diagnosed with bpd may exhibit none one or multiple of the following 91 105 93 subtype features discouraged borderline including avoidant and dependent features pliant submissive loyal humble feels vulnerable and in constant jeopardy feels hopeless depressed helpless and powerless petulant borderline including negativistic features negativistic impatient restless as well as stubborn defiant sullen pessimistic and resentful easily feels slighted and quickly disillusioned impulsive borderline including histrionic or antisocial features captivating capricious superficial flighty distractable frenetic and seductive fearing loss the individual becomes agitated gloomy and irritable and potentially suicidal self destructive borderline including depressive or masochistic features inward turning intropunitive self punishing angry conforming deferential and ingratiating behaviors have deteriorated increasingly high strung and moody possible suicide misdiagnosis edit main article misdiagnosis of borderline personality disorder people with bpd may be misdiagnosed for a variety of reasons one reason for misdiagnosis is bpd has symptoms that coexist comorbidity with other disorders such as depression post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and bipolar disorder 91 106 93 91 107 93 according to regression and factor analyses the criteria for bpd do not even form a separate entity and bpd is not distinguishable from negative affectivity bpd diagnosis does not seem to add anything to other diagnoses rather it seems unnecessary and even misleading this is according to a study in personality disorders 2022 91 108 93 adolescence edit onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood although symptoms suggestive of this disorder can sometimes be observed in children 91 109 93 symptoms among adolescents that predict the development of bpd in adulthood may include problems with body image extreme sensitivity to rejection behavioral problems non suicidal self injury attempts to find exclusive relationships and severe shame 91 43 93 many adolescents experience these symptoms without going on to develop bpd but those who experience them are 9 times as likely as their peers to develop bpd they are also more likely to develop other forms of long term social disabilities 91 43 93 bpd is recognised as a valid and stable diagnosis during adolescence 91 110 93 91 111 93 91 112 93 91 113 93 the diagnosis of bpd also described as personality disorder borderline pattern qualifier in adolescents is supported in recent updates to the international diagnostic and psychiatric classification tools including the dsm 5 and icd 11 91 114 93 91 115 93 91 116 93 early diagnosis of bpd has been recognised as instrumental to the early intervention and effective treatment for bpd in young people 91 112 93 91 117 93 91 118 93 accordingly national treatment guidelines recommend the diagnosis and treatment of bpd among adolescents in many countries including australia the united kingdom spain and switzerland 91 119 93 91 120 93 91 121 93 91 122 93 the diagnosis of bpd during adolescence has been controversial 91 112 93 91 123 93 91 124 93 early clinical guidelines encouraged caution when diagnosing bpd during adolescence 91 125 93 91 126 93 91 127 93 perceived barriers to the diagnosis of bpd during adolescence included concerns about the validity of a diagnosis in young people the misdiagnosis of normal adolescent behaviour as symptoms of bpd the stigmatising effect of a diagnosis for adolescents and whether personality during adolescence was sufficiently stable for a valid diagnosis of bpd 91 112 93 psychiatric research has since shown bpd to be a valid stable and clinically useful diagnosis in adolescent populations 91 110 93 91 111 93 91 112 93 91 113 93 however ongoing misconceptions about the diagnosis of bpd in adolescence remain prevalent among mental health professionals 91 128 93 91 129 93 91 130 93 clinical reluctance to diagnose bpd is a key barrier to the provision of effective treatment in adolescent populations 91 128 93 91 131 93 91 132 93 a bpd diagnosis in adolescence might predict that the disorder will continue into adulthood 91 125 93 91 133 93 among individuals diagnosed with bpd during adolescence there appears to be one group in which the disorder remains stable over time and another group in which the individuals move in and out of the diagnosis 91 134 93 earlier diagnoses may be helpful in creating a more effective treatment plan for the adolescent 91 125 93 91 133 93 family therapy is considered a helpful component of treatment for adolescents with bpd 91 135 93 differential diagnosis and comorbidity edit lifetime comorbid co occurring

values from 1998 study 91 136 93 value not provided by study a 2008 study found that at some point in their lives 75 of people with bpd meet criteria for mood disorders especially major depression and bipolar i and nearly 75 meet criteria for an anxiety disorder 91 138 93 nearly 73 meet the criteria for a substance use disorder and about 40 for ptsd 91 138 93 it is noteworthy that less than half of the participants with bpd in this study presented with ptsd a prevalence similar to that reported in an earlier study 91 136 93 the finding that less than half of patients with bpd experience ptsd during their lives challenges the theory that bpd and ptsd are the same disorder 91 136 93 there are marked sex differences in the types of comorbid conditions a person with bpd is likely to have 91 136 93 a higher percentage of males with bpd meet criteria for substance use disorders while a higher percentage of females with bpd meet criteria for ptsd and eating disorders 91 136 93 91 138 93 91 139 93 in one study 38 of participants with bpd met the criteria for a diagnosis of adhd 91 137 93 in another study 6 of 41 participants 15 met the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder a subgroup that had significantly more frequent suicide attempts 91 140 93 regardless that it is an infradiagnosed disorder a few studies have shown that the lower expressions of it might lead to wrong diagnoses the many and shifting axis i disorders in people with bpd can sometimes cause clinicians to miss the presence of the underlying personality disorder however since a complex pattern of axis i diagnoses has been found to strongly predict the presence of bpd clinicians can use the feature of a complex pattern of comorbidity as a clue that bpd might be present 91 136 93 mood disorders edit many people with borderline personality disorder also have mood disorders such as major depressive disorder or a bipolar disorder 91 41 93 some characteristics of bpd are similar to those of mood disorders which can complicate the diagnosis 91 141 93 91 142 93 91 143 93 it is especially common for people to be misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when they have borderline personality disorder or vice versa 91 144 93 for someone with bipolar disorder behavior suggestive of bpd might appear while experiencing an episode of major depression or mania only to disappear once mood has stabilized 91 145 93 for this reason it is ideal to wait until mood has stabilized before attempting to make a diagnosis 91 145 93 at face value the affective lability of bpd and the rapid mood cycling of bipolar disorders can seem very similar 91 146 93 it can be difficult even for experienced clinicians if they are unfamiliar with bpd to differentiate between the mood swings of these two conditions 91 147 93 however there are some clear differences 91 144 93 first the mood swings of bpd and bipolar disorder tend to have different durations in some people with bipolar disorder episodes of depression or mania last for at least two weeks at a time which is much longer than moods last in people with bpd 91 144 93 even among those who experience bipolar disorder with more rapid mood shifts their moods usually last for days while the moods of people with bpd can change in minutes or hours 91 147 93 so while euphoria and impulsivity in someone with bpd might resemble a manic episode the experience would be too brief to qualify as a manic episode 91 145 93 91 147 93 second the moods of bipolar disorder do not respond to changes in the environment while the moods of bpd do respond to changes in the environment 91 145 93 that is a positive event would not lift the depressed mood caused by bipolar disorder but a positive event would potentially lift the depressed mood of someone with bpd similarly an undesirable event would not dampen the euphoria caused by bipolar disorder but an undesirable event would dampen the euphoria of someone with borderline personality disorder 91 145 93 third when people with bpd experience euphoria it is usually without the racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep that are typical of hypomania 91 145 93 though a later 2013 study of data collected in 2004 found that borderline personality disorder diagnosis and symptoms were associated with chronic sleep disturbances including difficulty initiating sleep difficulty maintaining sleep and waking earlier than desired as well as with the consequences of poor sleep and noted that f ew studies have examined the experience of chronic sleep disturbances in those with borderline personality disorder 91 148 93 because the two conditions have a number of similar symptoms bpd was once considered to be a mild form of bipolar disorder 91 149 93 91 150 93 or to exist on the bipolar spectrum however this would require that the underlying mechanism causing these symptoms be the same for both conditions differences in phenomenology family history longitudinal course and responses to treatment suggest that this is not the case 91 151 93 researchers have found only a modest association between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder with a strong spectrum relationship with bpd and bipolar disorder extremely unlikely 91 152 93 benazzi et al suggest that the dsm iv bpd diagnosis combines two unrelated characteristics an affective instability dimension related to bipolar ii and an impulsivity dimension not related to bipolar ii 91 153 93 premenstrual dysphoric disorder edit premenstrual dysphoric disorder pmdd occurs in 3 8 of women 91 154 93 symptoms begin during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and end during menstruation 91 155 93 symptoms may include marked mood swings irritability depressed mood feeling hopeless or suicidal a subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control anxiety binge eating difficulty concentrating and substantial impairment of interpersonal relationships 91 156 93 91 157 93 people with pmdd typically begin to experience symptoms in their early twenties although many do not seek treatment until their early thirties 91 156 93 although some of the symptoms of pmdd and bpd are similar they are different disorders they are distinguishable by the timing and duration of symptoms which are markedly different the symptoms of pmdd occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle 91 156 93 whereas bpd symptoms occur persistently at all stages of the menstrual cycle in addition the symptoms of pmdd do not include impulsivity 91 156 93 comorbid axis ii disorders edit percentage of people with bpd and a

article management of borderline personality disorder psychotherapy is the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder 91 11 93 treatments should be based on the needs of the individual rather than upon the general diagnosis of bpd medications are useful for treating comorbid disorders such as depression and anxiety 91 158 93 short term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes or long term prevention of suicidal behavior in those with bpd 91 159 93 psychotherapy edit long term psychotherapy is currently the treatment of choice for bpd 91 160 93 while psychotherapy in particular dialectical behavior therapy dbt and psychodynamic approaches is effective the effects are slow many people have to put in years of work to be effective 91 161 93 more rigorous treatments are not substantially better than less rigorous treatments 91 162 93 there are six such treatments available dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy ddp 91 163 93 mentalization based treatment mbt transference focused psychotherapy dialectical behavior therapy dbt general psychiatric management and schema focused therapy 91 43 93 91 164 93 long term therapy of any kind is better than no treatment especially in reducing urges to self injure 91 160 93 transference focused therapy aims to break away from absolute thinking in this it gets the people to articulate their social interpretations and their emotions in order to turn their views into less rigid categories the therapist addresses the individual s feelings and goes over situations real or realistic that could happen as well as how to approach them 91 165 93 the dialectical behavior therapy dbt components are interpersonal communication distress tolerance emotional regulation and mindfulness in doing this it helps the individual with bpd gain skills to manage symptoms 91 165 93 since those diagnosed with bpd have such intense emotions learning to regulate them is a huge step in the therapeutic process some components of dbt are working long term with patients building skills to understand and regulate emotions homework assignments and strong availability of therapist to their client 91 166 93 patients with borderline personality disorder also must take time in dbt to work with their therapist to learn how to get through situations surrounded by intense emotions or stress as well as learning how to better their interpersonal relationships the stages used in dialectical behavior therapy cognitive behavioral therapy cbt is also a type of psychotherapy used for treatment of bpd this type of therapy relies on changing people s behaviors and beliefs by identifying problems from the disorder cbt is known to reduce some anxiety and mood symptoms as well as reduce suicidal thoughts and self harming behaviors 91 8 93 mentalization based therapy and transference focused psychotherapy are based on psychodynamic principles and dialectical behavior therapy is based on cognitive behavioral principles and mindfulness 91 160 93 general psychiatric management combines the core principles from each of these treatments and it is considered easier to learn and less intensive 91 43 93 randomized controlled trials have shown that dbt and mbt may be the most effective and the two share many similarities 91 167 93 91 168 93 researchers are interested in developing shorter versions of these therapies to increase accessibility to relieve the financial burden on patients and to relieve the resource burden on treatment providers 91 160 93 91 168 93 some research indicates that mindfulness meditation may bring about favorable structural changes in the brain including changes in brain structures that are associated with bpd 91 169 93 91 170 93 91 171 93 mindfulness based interventions also appear to bring about an improvement in symptoms characteristic of bpd and some clients who underwent mindfulness based treatment no longer met a minimum of five of the dsm iv tr diagnostic criteria for bpd 91 171 93 91 172 93 medications edit a 2010 review by the cochrane collaboration found that no medications show promise for the core bpd symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness identity disturbance and abandonment however the authors found that some medications may impact isolated symptoms associated with bpd or the symptoms of comorbid conditions 91 173 93 a 2017 review examined evidence published since the 2010 cochrane review and found that evidence of effectiveness of medication for bpd remains very mixed and is still highly compromised by suboptimal study design 91 174 93 a 2020 review found that research into pharmacological treatments had declined with more results confirming no benefits the review found moderate to large statistically significant effects for both doses of quetiapine 150 mg day and 300 mg day regarding bpd severity psychosocial impairment and aggression and an additional effect for the higher dose regarding manic symptoms despite lack of evidence of efficacy the review stated that ssri antidepressants continue to be widely prescribed to people with bpd 91 21 93 of the typical antipsychotics studied in relation to bpd haloperidol may reduce anger and flupenthixol may reduce the likelihood of suicidal behavior among the atypical antipsychotics one trial found that aripiprazole may reduce interpersonal problems and impulsivity 91 173 93 olanzapine as well as quetiapine may decrease affective instability anger psychotic paranoid symptoms and anxiety but a placebo had a greater benefit on suicidal ideation than olanzapine did the effect of ziprasidone was not significant 91 173 93 91 174 93 mood stabilizers are anticonvulsant drugs used for both epilepsy and reduction in mood variations in patients with excessive and often dangerous mood variabilities often the goal of the anticonvulsants is to bring certain areas of the brain to equilibrium and control outbursts and seizures of the mood stabilizers studied valproate semisodium may ameliorate depression impulsivity interpersonal problems and anger topiramate may ameliorate interpersonal problems impulsivity anxiety anger and general psychiatric pathology the effect of carbamazepine was not significant of the antidepressants amitriptyline may reduce depression but mianserin fluoxetine fluvoxamine and phenelzine sulfate showed no effect omega 3 fatty acid may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression as of 2017 91 update 93 trials with these medications had not been replicated and the effect of long term use had not been assessed 91 173 93 91 174 93 lamotrigine showed no benefit in a large randomized clinical trial 91 21 93 a case study on a male patient with borderline personality disorder found iv ketamine treatments typically used for treatment unresponsive depression drastically decreased anxiety depression and suicidal behaviors 91 175 93 chen and associates 2022 studied the effect of iv ketamine on adults with major depressive disorder mdd and borderline features compared to those with mdd without borderline features those with borderline features tend to be harder to treat and are more likely to suffer from suicidal ideation they found that iv ketamine was more effective at treating those with borderline features 14 days after treatment as compared to the mdd without borderline features group while this study looked at those with mdd and borderline features further studies are needed to see if the results will be the same for those with a diagnosis of bpd in particular those with bpd may experience episodes of psychosis and dissociation which can also be brought on by the use of ketamine however in this study those with borderline features did not show increased signs of dissociation or psychosis suggesting that ketamine may eventually prove to be an effective treatment for those with mdd and bpd 91 176 93 because of weak evidence and the potential for serious side effects from some of these medications the united kingdom uk national institute for health and clinical excellence nice 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of bpd recommends drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behavior associated with the disorder however drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions they suggest a review of the treatment of people with borderline personality disorder who do not have a diagnosed comorbid mental or physical illness and who are currently being prescribed drugs with the aim of reducing and stopping unnecessary drug treatment 91 177 93 cattarinussi 2021 stated medication for treatment of borderline personality disorder should be used at very low doses and for minimal amounts of time 91 178 93 crawford 2018 found that despite mood stabilizers being prescribed frequently for bpd patients they are neither cost effective or medically effective in treating bpd as whole after performing a year long study 91 179 93 services edit there is a significant difference between the number of those who would benefit from treatment and the number of those who are treated the so called treatment gap is a function of the disinclination to submit for treatment an underdiagnosing of the disorder by healthcare providers and the limited availability and access to state of the art treatments 91 180 93 there are also ongoing problems with creating clear pathways to services and medical care with many people with bpd finding it difficult to access treatment even when medical providers try to help many are not trained or equipped to help severe bpd which is a problem that has been recognized by both those affected by bpd and doctors 91 181 93 nonetheless individuals with bpd accounted for about 20 of psychiatric hospitalizations in one survey 91 182 93 the majority of individuals with bpd who are in treatment continue to use outpatient treatment in a sustained manner for several years but the number using the more restrictive and costly forms of treatment such as inpatient admission declines with time 91 183 93 experience of services varies 91 184 93 assessing suicide risk can be a challenge for clinicians and patients themselves tend to underestimate the lethality of self injurious behaviors people with bpd typically have a chronically elevated risk of suicide much above that of the general population and a history of multiple attempts when in crisis 91 185 93 approximately half the individuals who commit suicide meet criteria for a personality disorder borderline personality disorder remains the most commonly associated personality disorder with suicide 91 186 93 after a patient with bpd died the national health service nhs in england was criticized by a coroner in 2014 for the lack of commissioned services to support those with bpd evidence was given that 45 of female patients had bpd and there was no provision or priority for therapeutic psychological services at the time there were only a total of 60 specialized inpatient beds in england all of them located in london or the northeast region 91 187 93 prognosis edit with treatment the majority of people with bpd can find relief from distressing symptoms and achieve remission defined as a consistent relief from symptoms for at least two years 91 188 93 91 189 93 a longitudinal study tracking the symptoms of people with bpd found that 34 5 achieved remission within two years from the beginning of the study within four years 49 4 had achieved remission and within six years 68 6 had achieved remission by the end of the study 73 5 of participants were found to be in remission 91 188 93 moreover of those who achieved recovery from symptoms only 5 9 experienced recurrences a later study found that ten years from baseline during a hospitalization 86 of patients had sustained a stable recovery from symptoms 91 190 93 91 191 93 patient personality can play an important role during the therapeutic process leading to better clinical outcomes recent research has shown that bpd patients undergoing dialectical behavior therapy dbt exhibit better clinical outcomes correlated with higher levels of the trait of agreeableness in the patient compared to patients either low in agreeableness or not being treated with dbt this association was mediated through the strength of a working alliance between patient and therapist that is more agreeable patients developed stronger working alliances with their therapists which in turn led to better clinical outcomes 91 192 93 in addition to recovering from distressing symptoms people with bpd also achieve high levels of psychosocial functioning a longitudinal study tracking the social and work abilities of participants with bpd found that six years after diagnosis 56 of participants had good function in work and social environments compared to 26 of participants when they were first diagnosed vocational achievement was generally more limited even compared to those with other personality disorders however those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly more likely to have good relationships with a romantic partner and at least one parent good performance at work and school a sustained work and school history and good psychosocial functioning overall 91 193 93 epidemiology edit the prevalence of bpd was estimated in the mid 2000s to be 1 2 of the general population 91 189 93 and to occur three times more often in women than in men 91 194 93 91 195 93 however the lifetime prevalence of bpd as defined in the dsm iv in a 2008 study was found to be 5 9 of the american population occurring in 5 6 of men and 6 2 of women 91 138 93 the difference in rates between men and women in this study was not found to be statistically significant 91 138 93 borderline personality disorder is estimated to contribute to 20 of psychiatric hospitalizations and to occur among 10 of outpatients 91 196 93 29 5 of new inmates in the u s state of iowa fit a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in 2007 91 197 93 and the overall prevalence of bpd in the u s prison population is thought to be 17 91 196 93 these high numbers may be related to the high frequency of substance use and substance use disorders among people with bpd which is estimated at 38 91 196 93 history edit devaluation in edvard munch s salome 1903 idealization and devaluation of others in personal relations is a common trait in bpd the painter edvard munch depicted his new friend the violinist eva mudocci in both ways within days first as a woman seen by a man in love then as a bloodthirsty and cannibalistic salome 91 198 93 in modern times munch has been diagnosed as having had bpd 91 199 93 91 200 93 the coexistence of intense divergent moods within an individual was recognized by homer hippocrates and aretaeus the latter describing the vacillating presence of impulsive anger melancholia and mania within a single person the concept was revived by swiss physician th ophile bonet in 1684 who using the term folie maniaco m lancolique 91 201 93 described the phenomenon of unstable moods that followed an unpredictable course other writers noted the same pattern including the american psychiatrist charles h hughes in 1884 and j c rosse in 1890 who called the disorder borderline insanity 91 202 93 in 1921 kraepelin identified an excitable personality that closely parallels the borderline features outlined in the current concept of bpd 91 203 93 the first significant psychoanalytic work to use the term borderline was written by adolf stern in 1938 91 204 93 91 205 93 it described a group of patients with what he thought to be a mild form of schizophrenia on the borderline between neurosis and psychosis the 1960s and 1970s saw a shift from thinking of the condition as borderline schizophrenia to thinking of it as a borderline affective disorder mood disorder on the fringes of bipolar disorder cyclothymia and dysthymia in the dsm ii stressing the intensity and variability of moods it was called cyclothymic personality affective personality 91 125 93 while the term borderline was evolving to refer to a distinct category of disorder psychoanalysts such as otto kernberg were using it to refer to a broad spectrum of issues describing an intermediate level of personality organization 91 203 93 between neurosis and psychosis 91 206 93 after standardized criteria were developed 91 207 93 to distinguish it from mood disorders and other axis i disorders bpd became a personality disorder diagnosis in 1980 with the publication of the dsm iii 91 189 93 the diagnosis was distinguished from sub syndromal schizophrenia which was termed schizotypal personality disorder 91 206 93 the dsm iv axis ii work group of the american psychiatric association finally decided on the name borderline personality disorder which is still in use by the dsm 5 today 91 9 93 however the term borderline has been described as uniquely inadequate for describing the symptoms characteristic of this disorder 91 208 93 etymology edit earlier versions of the dsm before the multiaxial diagnosis system classified most people with mental health problems into two categories the psychotics and the neurotics clinicians noted a certain class of neurotics who when in crisis appeared to straddle the borderline into psychosis 91 209 93 the term borderline personality disorder was coined in american psychiatry in the 1960s it became the preferred term over a number of competing names such as emotionally unstable character disorder and borderline schizophrenia during the 1970s 91 210 93 91 211 93 borderline personality disorder was included in dsm iii 1980 despite not being universally recognized as a valid diagnosis 91 212 93 controversies edit credibility and validity of testimony edit the credibility of individuals with personality disorders has been questioned at least since the 1960s 91 213 93 58 8202 2 8202 two concerns are the incidence of dissociation episodes among people with bpd and the belief that lying is a key component of this condition 91 citation needed 93 dissociation edit researchers disagree about whether dissociation or a sense of emotional detachment and physical experiences impacts the ability of people with bpd to recall the specifics of past events a 1999 study reported that the specificity of autobiographical memory was decreased in bpd patients 91 214 93 the researchers found that decreased ability to recall specifics was correlated with patients levels of dissociation 91 214 93 lying as a feature edit some theorists argue that patients with bpd often lie 91 215 93 however others write that they have rarely seen lying among patients with bpd in clinical practice 91 215 93 gender edit joel paris states that in the clinic up to 80 of patients are women that may not be true in the community 91 216 93 he offers the following explanations regarding these sex discrepancies the most probable explanation for gender differences in clinical samples is that women are more likely to develop the kind of symptoms that bring patients in for treatment twice as many women as men in the community have depression weissman amp klerman 1985 in contrast there is a preponderance of men meeting the criteria for substance use disorder and psychopathy robins amp regier 1991 and males with these disorders do not necessarily present in the mental health system men and women with similar psychological problems may express distress differently men tend to drink more and carry out more crimes women tend to turn their anger on themselves leading to depression as well as the cutting and overdosing that characterize bpd thus anti social personality disorder aspd and borderline personality disorders might derive from similar underlying pathology but present with symptoms strongly influenced by gender paris 1997a looper amp paris 2000 we have even more specific evidence that men with bpd may not seek help in a study of completed suicides among people aged 18 to 35 years lesage et al 1994 30 of the suicides involved individuals with bpd as confirmed by psychological autopsy in which symptoms were assessed by interviews with family members most of the suicide completers were men and very few were in treatment similar findings emerged from a later study conducted by our own research group mcgirr paris lesage renaud amp turecki 2007 91 53 93 in short men are less likely to seek or accept appropriate treatment more likely to be treated for symptoms of bpd such as substance use rather than bpd itself the symptoms of bpd and aspd possibly deriving from a similar underlying etiology more likely to wind up in the correctional system due to criminal behavior and more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis among men diagnosed with bpd there is also evidence of a higher suicide rate men are more than twice as likely as women 18 percent versus 8 percent to die by suicide 91 52 93 there are also sex differences in borderline personality disorders 91 217 93 men with bpd are more likely to recreationally use substances have explosive temper high levels of novelty seeking and have anti social narcissistic passive aggressive or sadistic personality traits 91 217 93 women with bpd are more likely to have eating disorders mood disorders anxiety and post traumatic stress 91 217 93 manipulative behavior edit manipulative behavior to obtain nurturance is considered by the dsm iv tr and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder 91 218 93 however marsha linehan notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with bpd who communicate intense pain or who engage in self harm and suicidal behavior do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others 91 219 93 the impact of such behavior on others often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends family members and therapists is thus assumed to have been the person s intention 91 219 93 however their frequent expressions of intense pain self harming or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable 91 220 93 stigma edit the features of bpd include emotional instability intense unstable interpersonal relationships a need for intimacy and a fear of rejection as a result people with bpd often evoke intense emotions in those around them pejorative terms to describe people with bpd such as difficult treatment resistant manipulative demanding and attention seeking are often used and may become a self fulfilling prophecy as the negative treatment of these individuals triggers further self destructive behavior 91 221 93 since bpd can be a stigmatizing diagnosis even within the mental health community some survivors of childhood abuse who are diagnosed with bpd are re traumatized by the negative responses they receive from healthcare providers 91 222 93 one camp argues that it would be better to diagnose these men or women with post traumatic stress disorder as this would acknowledge the impact of abuse on their behavior critics of the ptsd diagnosis argue that it medicalizes abuse rather than addressing the root causes in society 91 223 93 regardless a diagnosis of ptsd does not encompass all aspects of the disorder see brain abnormalities and terminology physical violence edit the stigma surrounding borderline personality disorder includes the belief that people with bpd are prone to violence toward others 91 224 93 while movies and visual media often sensationalize people with bpd by portraying them as violent the majority of researchers agree that people with bpd are unlikely to physically harm others 91 224 93 although people with bpd often struggle with experiences of intense anger a defining characteristic of bpd is that they direct it inward toward themselves 91 225 93 one of the key differences between bpd and antisocial personality disorder aspd is that people with bpd tend to internalize anger by hurting themselves while people with aspd tend to externalize it by hurting others 91 225 93 one 2020 study found that bpd is individually associated with psychological physical and sexual forms of intimate partner violence ipv especially amongst men 91 226 93 in terms of the ampd trait facets hostility negative affectivity suspiciousness negative affectivity and risk taking disinhibition were most strongly associated with ipv perpetration for the total sample 91 226 93 in addition adults with bpd have often experienced abuse in childhood so many people with bpd adopt a no tolerance policy toward expressions of anger of any kind 91 225 93 their extreme aversion to violence can cause many people with bpd to overcompensate and experience difficulties being assertive and expressing their needs 91 225 93 this is one way in which people with bpd choose to harm themselves over potentially causing harm to others 91 225 93 another way in which people with bpd avoid expressing their anger through violence is by causing physical damage to themselves such as engaging in non suicidal self injury 91 34 93 91 224 93 mental health care providers edit people with bpd are considered to be among the most challenging groups of patients to work with in therapy requiring a high level of skill and training for the psychiatrists therapists and nurses involved in their treatment 91 227 93 a majority of psychiatric staff report finding individuals with bpd moderately to extremely difficult to work with and more difficult than other client groups 91 228 93 this largely negative view of bpd can result in people with bpd being terminated from treatment early being provided harmful treatment not being informed of their diagnosis of bpd or being misdiagnosed 91 229 93 with healthcare providers contributing to the stigma of a bpd diagnosis seeking treatment can often result in the perpetuation of bpd features 91 229 93 efforts are ongoing to improve public and staff attitudes toward people with bpd 91 230 93 91 231 93 in psychoanalytic theory the stigmatization among mental health care providers may be thought to reflect countertransference when a therapist projects his or her own feelings on to a client thus a diagnosis of bpd often says more about the clinician s negative reaction to the patient than it does about the patient and explains away the breakdown in empathy between the therapist and the patient and becomes an institutional epithet in the guise of pseudoscientific jargon 91 206 93 this inadvertent countertransference can give rise to inappropriate clinical responses including excessive use of medication inappropriate mothering and punitive use of limit setting and interpretation 91 232 93 some clients feel the diagnosis is helpful allowing them to understand that they are not alone and to connect with others with bpd who have developed helpful coping mechanisms however others experience the term borderline personality disorder as a pejorative label rather than an informative diagnosis they report concerns that their self destructive behavior is incorrectly perceived as manipulative and that the stigma surrounding this disorder limits their access to health care 91 233 93 indeed mental health professionals frequently refuse to provide services to those who have received a bpd diagnosis 91 234 93 terminology edit because of concerns around stigma and because of a move away from the original theoretical basis for the term see history there is ongoing debate about renaming borderline personality disorder while some clinicians agree with the current name others argue that it should be changed 91 235 93 since many who are labelled with borderline personality disorder find the name unhelpful stigmatizing or inaccurate 91 235 93 91 236 93 valerie porr president of treatment and research advancement association for personality disorders states that the name bpd is confusing imparts no relevant or descriptive information and reinforces existing stigma 91 237 93 alternative suggestions for names include emotional regulation disorder or emotional dysregulation disorder impulse disorder and interpersonal regulatory disorder are other valid alternatives according to john g gunderson of mclean hospital in the united states 91 238 93 another term suggested by psychiatrist carolyn quadrio is post traumatic personality disorganization ptpd reflecting the condition s status as often both a form of chronic post traumatic stress disorder ptsd as well as a personality disorder 91 83 93 however although many with bpd do have traumatic histories some do not report any kind of traumatic event which suggests that bpd is not necessarily a trauma spectrum disorder 91 90 93 the treatment and research advancements national association for personality disorders tara apd campaigned unsuccessfully to change the name and designation of bpd in dsm 5 published in may 2013 in which the name borderline personality disorder remains unchanged and it is not considered a trauma and stressor related disorder 91 239 93 society and culture edit fiction edit literature edit in literature characters with behavior consistent with borderline personality disorder include catherine in wuthering heights

1975 is consistent with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder 91 247 93 the films play misty for me 1971 91 248 93 and girl interrupted 1999 based on the memoir of the same name both suggest the emotional instability of the disorder 91 249 93 the film single white female 1992 suggests characteristic which are typical of the disorder the character hedy had markedly disturbed sense of

of a character with the disorder even though it is never mentioned onscreen 91 252 93 psychiatrists eric bui and rachel rodgers argue that the anakin skywalker darth vader character in the star wars films meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria bui also found anakin a useful example to explain bpd to medical students in particular bui points to the character s abandonment issues uncertainty over his identity and dissociative episodes 91 253 93 television edit on television the cw show crazy ex girlfriend portrays the main character played by rachel bloom with borderline personality
