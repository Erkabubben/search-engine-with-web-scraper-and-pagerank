opposition or hardship see morale for the novella see morality novella morals redirects here for the film see morals film immoralist redirects here for the novel see the immoralist allegory with a portrait of a venetian senator allegory of the morality of earthly things attributed to tintoretto 1585 morality from 32 latin 32 moralitas 160 manner character proper behavior is the differentiation of intentions decisions and actions between those that are distinguished as proper right and those that are improper wrong 91 1 93 morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy religion or culture or it can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal 91 2 93 morality may also be specifically synonymous with goodness or rightness moral philosophy includes meta ethics which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology and normative ethics which studies more concrete systems of moral decision making such as deontological ethics and consequentialism an example of normative ethical philosophy is the golden rule which states one should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself 91 3 93 91 4 93 immorality is the active opposition to morality i e opposition to that which is good or right while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of indifference

morality ethics edit immanuel kant introduced the categorical imperative act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law see also sittlichkeit ethics also known as moral philosophy is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality the word ethics is commonly used interchangeably with morality and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition group or individual 91 8 93 likewise certain types of ethical theories especially deontological ethics sometimes distinguish between ethics and morals although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of immanuel kant based on notions such as duty obligation and principles of conduct reserving ethics for the more aristotelian approach to practical reasoning based on the notion of a virtue and generally avoiding the separation of moral considerations from other practical considerations 91 9 93 for a chinese discussion of ethics morality and humanism see confucius laozi and daode descriptive and normative edit in its descriptive sense morality refers to personal or cultural values codes of conduct or social mores from a society that provides these codes of conduct in which it applies and is accepted by an individual it does not connote objective claims of right or wrong but only refers to that which is considered right or wrong descriptive ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense 91 10 93 in its normative sense morality refers to whatever if anything is actually right or wrong which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures normative ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense 91 10 93 realism and anti realism edit philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality that is theories of meta ethics are broadly divided into two classes moral realism is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts for example while they might concede that forces of social conformity significantly shape individuals moral decisions they deny that those cultural norms and customs define morally right behavior this may be the philosophical view propounded by ethical naturalists but not all moral realists accept that position e g ethical non naturalists 91 11 93 moral anti realism on the other hand holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts instead they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts error theory claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts ethical subjectivism or else do not attempt to describe the world at all but rather something else like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command non cognitivism some forms of non cognitivism and ethical subjectivism while considered anti realist in the robust sense used here are considered realist in the sense synonymous with moral universalism for example universal prescriptivism is a universalist form of non cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives and divine command theory and ideal observer theory are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being respectively anthropology edit morality with practical reasoning edit practical reason is necessary for the moral agency but it is not a sufficient condition for moral agency 91 12 93 real life issues that need solutions do need both rationality and emotion to be sufficiently moral one uses rationality as a pathway to the ultimate decision but the environment and emotions towards the environment at the moment must be a factor for the result to be truly moral as morality is subject to culture something can only be morally acceptable if the culture as a whole has accepted this to be true practical reason and relevant emotional considerations are both considered important for a decision to be moral 91 13 93 91 neutrality 32 is disputed 93 tribal and territorial edit celia green made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality 91 14 93 she characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive it defines a person s territory including his or her property and dependents which is not to be damaged or interfered with apart from these proscriptions territorial morality is permissive allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another by contrast tribal morality is prescriptive imposing the norms of the collective on the individual these norms will be arbitrary culturally dependent and flexible whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute such as kant s categorical imperative and geisler s graded absolutism green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property and the ascendancy of contract over status in group and out group edit main article in group and out group some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an in group the individual and those they believe to be of the same group or an out group people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules some biologists anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists believe this in group out group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival this belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution 91 15 93 in simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in group and irrational hostility towards the out group 91 16 93 gary r johnson and v s falger have argued that nationalism and patriotism are forms of this in group out group boundary jonathan haidt has noted 91 17 93 that experimental observation indicating an in group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by conservatives but far less so by liberals in group preference is also helpful at the individual level for the passing on of one s genes for example a mother who favors her own children more highly than the children of other people will give greater resources to her children than she will to strangers thus heightening her children s chances of survival and her own gene s chances of being perpetuated due to this within a population there is substantial selection pressure exerted toward this kind of self interest such that eventually all parents wind up favoring their own children the in group over other children the out group comparing cultures edit peterson and seligman 91 18 93 approach the anthropological view looking across cultures geo cultural areas and across millennia they conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined the major virtues they identified include wisdom knowledge courage humanity justice temperance and transcendence each of these includes several divisions for instance humanity includes love kindness and social intelligence still others theorize that morality is not always absolute contending that moral issues often differ along cultural lines a 2014 pew research study among several nations illuminates significant cultural differences among issues commonly related to morality including divorce extramarital affairs homosexuality gambling abortion alcohol use contraceptive use and premarital sex each of the 40 countries in this study has a range of percentages according to what percentage of each country believes the common moral issues are acceptable unacceptable or not moral issues at all each percentage regarding the significance of the moral issue varies greatly on the culture in which the moral issue is presented 91 19 93 advocates of a theory known as moral relativism subscribe to the notion that moral virtues are right or wrong only within the context of a certain standpoint e g cultural community in other words what is morally acceptable in one culture may be taboo in another they further contend that no moral virtue can objectively be proven right or wrong 91 20 93 critics of moral relativism point to historical atrocities such as infanticide slavery or genocide as counter arguments noting the difficulty in accepting these actions simply through cultural lenses fons trompenaars author of did the pedestrian die tested members of different cultures with various moral dilemmas one of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend a passenger riding in the car lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations from none to definite 91 21 93 evolution edit see also altruism 160 evolutionary explanations evolution of morality and evolutionary ethics the development of modern morality is a process closely tied to sociocultural evolution some evolutionary biologists particularly sociobiologists believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through group selection although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits i e increased evolutionary success humans consequently evolved pro social emotions such as feelings of empathy or guilt in response to these moral behaviors on this understanding moralities are sets of self perpetuating and biologically driven behaviors which encourage human cooperation biologists contend that all social animals from ants to elephants have modified their behaviors by restraining immediate selfishness in order to improve their evolutionary fitness human morality although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group s cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals fitness 91 22 93 on this view moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction inclusive fitness examples the maternal bond is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring the westermarck effect where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction underpins taboos against incest because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as inbreeding the phenomenon of reciprocity in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably for example some vampire bats fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation since these animals live in close knit groups over many years an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry wilkinson 1984 marc bekoff and jessica pierce 2009 have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups e g wolves coyotes elephants dolphins rats chimpanzees they define morality as a suite of interrelated other regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups this suite of behaviors includes empathy reciprocity altruism cooperation and a sense of fairness 91 23 93 in related work it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts 91 24 93 they also possess the ability to engage in deception and a level of social politics 91 25 93 prototypical of our own tendencies for gossip and reputation management christopher boehm 1982 91 26 93 has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout hominid evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size and in particular the development of theory of mind abilities psychology edit main article moral psychology see also kohlberg s stages of moral development and jean piaget 160 education and development of morality kohlberg s model of moral development in modern moral psychology morality is sometimes considered to change through personal development several psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals usually going through stages of different morals lawrence kohlberg jean piaget and elliot turiel have cognitive developmental approaches to moral development to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains in the ethics of care approach established by carol gilligan moral development occurs in the context of caring mutually responsive relationships which are based on interdependence particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally 91 27 93 social psychologists such as martin hoffman and jonathan haidt emphasize social and emotional development based on biology such as empathy moral identity theorists such as william damon and mordechai nisan see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self identity that is defined by moral purposes this moral self identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes of historical interest in psychology are the theories of psychoanalysts such as sigmund freud who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the super ego as guilt shame avoidance theories of moral development therefore tend to regard it as positive moral development the higher stages are morally higher though this naturally involves a circular argument the higher stages are better because they are higher but the better higher because they are better as an alternative to viewing morality as an individual trait some sociologists as well as social and discursive psychologists have taken upon themselves to study the in vivo aspects of morality by examining how persons conduct themselves in social interaction 91 28 93 91 29 93 91 30 93 91 31 93 moral cognition edit moral cognition refers to cognitive processes implicated in moral judgment and decision making and moral action it consists of several domain general cognitive processes ranging from perception of a morally salient stimulus to reasoning when faced with a moral dilemma while it s important to mention that there is not a single cognitive faculty dedicated exclusively to moral cognition 91 32 93 91 33 93 characterizing the contributions of domain general processes to moral behavior is a critical scientific endeavor to understand how morality works and how it can be improved 91 34 93 cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists investigate the inputs to these cognitive processes and their interactions as well as how these contribute to moral behavior by running controlled experiments 91 35 93 in these experiments putatively moral versus nonmoral stimuli are compared to each other while controlling for other variables such as content or working memory load often the differential neural response to specifically moral statements or scenes are examined using functional neuroimaging experiments critically the specific cognitive processes that are involved depend on the prototypical situation that a person encounters 91 36 93 for instance while situations that require an active decision on a moral dilemma may require active reasoning an immediate reaction to a shocking moral violation may involve quick affect laden processes nonetheless certain cognitive skills such as being able to attribute mental states beliefs intents desires emotions to oneself and others is a common feature of a broad range of prototypical situations in line with this a meta analysis found overlapping activity between moral emotion and moral reasoning tasks suggesting a shared neural network for both tasks 91 37 93 the results of this meta analysis however also demonstrated that the processing of moral input is affected by task demands regarding the issues of morality in video games some scholars believe that because players appear in video games as actors they maintain a distance between their sense of self and the role of the game in terms of imagination therefore the decision making and moral behavior of players in the game are not representing player s moral dogma 91 38 93 it has been recently found that moral judgment consists in concurrent evaluations of three different components that align with precepts from three dominant moral theories virtue ethics deontology and consequentialism the character of a person agent component a their actions deed component d and the consequences brought about in the situation consequences component c 91 39 93 this implies that various inputs of the situation a person encounters affect moral cognition neuroscience edit see also science of morality and neuromorality the brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by multiple quantitative large scale meta analyses of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature 91 40 93 91 37 93 91 41 93 91 42 93 the neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others intentions i e theory of mind and the network pertaining to representing others vicariously experienced emotional states i e empathy this supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons points of view and to grasping others feelings these results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain global i e there might be no such things as a moral module in the human brain and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub systems 91 40 93 brain areas edit an essential shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content 91 43 93 the salience network responds to behaviorally salient events 91 44 93 and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision making processes the explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpc while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the temporoparietal junction area 91 45 93 91 43 93 stimulation of the vmpc by transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment according to this investigation tms did not disrupt participants ability to make any moral judgment on the contrary moral judgments of intentional harms and non harms were unaffected by tms to either the rtpj or the control site presumably however people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action s harmful outcome but the agent s intentions and beliefs so why were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by tms to the rtpj one possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time based on this view when information concerning the agent s belief is unavailable or degraded the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other morally relevant factors e g outcome alternatively following tms to the rtpj moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account on either account when belief information is degraded or unavailable moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors e g outcome for intentional harms and non harms however the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as to the intention thus the researchers suggest that tms to the rtpj disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own 91 46 93 similarly vmpc impaired persons will judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action 91 47 93 mirror neurons edit mirror neurons are neurons in the brain that fire when another person is observed doing a certain action the neurons fire in imitation of the action being observed causing the same muscles to act minutely in the observer as are acting grossly in the person actually performing the action research on mirror neurons since their discovery in 1996 91 48 93 suggests that they may have a role to play not only in action understanding but also in emotion sharing empathy cognitive neuroscientist jean decety thinks that the ability to recognize and vicariously experience what another individual is undergoing was a key step forward in the evolution of social behavior and ultimately morality 91 49 93 the inability to feel empathy is one of the defining characteristics of psychopathy and this would appear to lend support to decety s view 91 50 93 91 51 93 genetics edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may 2022 moral intuitions may have genetic bases a 2022 study conducted by scholars michael zakharin and timothy c bates and published by the european journal of personality found that moral foundations have significant genetic bases 91 52 93 another study conducted by smith and hatemi similarly found significant evidence in support of moral heritability by looking at and comparing the answers of moral dilemmas between twins 91 53 93 politics edit if morality is the answer to the question how ought we to live at the individual level politics can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges 91 54 93 it is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics moral foundations theory authored by jonathan haidt and colleagues 91 55 93 91 56 93 has been used to study the differences between liberals and conservatives in this regard 91 17 93 91 57 93 haidt found that americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty respect and purity self identified conservative americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more both groups gave care the highest over all weighting but conservatives valued fairness the lowest whereas liberals valued purity the lowest haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the united states can be traced to geo historical factors with conservatism strongest in closely knit ethnically homogenous communities in contrast to port cities where the cultural mix is greater thus requiring more liberalism group morality develops from shared concepts and beliefs and is often codified to regulate behavior within a culture or community various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess moral fiber whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate the continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community a positive example would be the function of cistercian reform in reviving monasticism a negative example would be the role of the dowager empress in the subjugation of china to european interests within nationalist movements there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality regardless of its content political morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments and to the support they receive from their host population the sentience institute co founded by jacy reese anthis analyzes the trajectory of moral progress in society via the framework of an expanding moral circle 91 58 93 noam chomsky states that if we adopt the principle of universality if an action is right or wrong for others it is right or wrong for us those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others more stringent ones in fact plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response or of right and wrong good and evil in fact one of them maybe the most elementary of moral principles is that of universality that is if something s right for me it s right for you if it s wrong for you it s wrong for me any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow 91 59 93 religion edit main articles ethics in religion and morality and religion see also divine command theory divine law religious law secular ethics and secular morality religion and morality are not synonymous morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is an almost automatic assumption 91 60 93 according to the westminster dictionary of christian ethics religion and morality are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other conceptually and in principle morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides 91 61 93 positions edit within the wide range of moral traditions religious value systems co exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as consequentialism freethought humanism utilitarianism and others there are many types of religious value systems modern monotheistic religions such as islam judaism christianity and to a certain degree others such as sikhism and zoroastrianism define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith other religions spanning pantheistic to nontheistic tend to be less absolute for example within buddhism the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for in the form of merit to determine if an action is right or wrong termed 91 62 93 a further disparity between the values of religious traditions is pointed out by barbara stoler miller who states that in hinduism practically right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank kinship and stages of life for modern westerners who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of hinduism most difficult to understand 91 63 93 religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas for example there is no absolute prohibition on killing in hinduism which recognizes that it may be inevitable and indeed necessary in certain circumstances 91 64 93 in monotheistic traditions certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms such as abortion or divorce a religion is not always positively associated with morality philosopher david hume stated that the greatest crimes have been found in many instances to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man s morals from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises even though he himself believe them sincere 91 65 93 religious value systems can also be used to justify acts that are contrary to contemporary morality such as massacres misogyny and slavery for example simon blackburn states that apologists for hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system and apologists for islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels 91 66 93 in regard to christianity he states that the bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children the mentally handicapped animals the environment the divorced unbelievers people with various sexual habits and elderly women 91 67 93 and notes morally suspect themes in the bible s new testament as well 91 68 93 e elizabeth anderson likewise holds that the bible contains both good and evil teachings and it is morally inconsistent 91 69 93 christian apologists address blackburn s viewpoints 91 70 93 and construe that jewish laws in the hebrew bible showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not property 91 71 93 humanists like paul kurtz believe that we can identify moral values across cultures even if we do not appeal to a supernatural or universalist understanding of principles values including integrity trustworthiness benevolence and fairness these values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers 91 72 93 empirical analyses edit several studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear b a 2001 review of studies on this topic found the existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied contested and inconclusive and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime 91 73 93 phil zuckerman s 2008 book society without god based on studies conducted during 14 months in scandinavia in 2005 2006 notes that denmark and sweden which are probably the least religious countries in the world and possibly in the history of the world enjoy among the lowest violent crime rates in the world and the lowest levels of corruption in the world 91 74 93 c dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century a 2005 study by gregory s paul published in the journal of religion and society stated that in general higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide juvenile and early adult mortality std infection rates teen pregnancy and abortion in the prosperous democracies and in all secular developing democracies a centuries long term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows with the exceptions being the united states with a high religiosity level and theistic portugal 91 75 93 d in a response gary jensen builds on and refines paul s study 91 76 93 he concludes that a complex relationship exists between religiosity and homicide with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it in april 2012 the results of a study which tested their subjects pro social sentiments were published in the social psychological and personality science journal in which non religious people had higher scores showing that they were more motivated by their own compassion to perform pro social behaviors religious people were found to be less motivated by compassion to be charitable than by an inner sense of moral obligation 91 77 93 91 78 93 see also edit ethics integrity applied

have lower divorce rates than faith groups on average though some faith groups had lower rates still 91 79 93 91 80 93 the study notes that fewer atheists and agnostics enter into marriage relative to faith based individuals b some studies appear to show positive links in the relationship between religiosity and moral behavior 91 81 93 91 82 93 91 83 93 modern research in criminology also suggests an inverse relationship between religion and crime 91 84 93 with some studies establishing this connection 91 85 93 a meta analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals criminal behavior 91 73 93 c zuckerman identifies that scandinavians have relatively high rates of petty crime and burglary but their overall rates of violent crime such as murder aggravated assault and rape are among the lowest on earth zuckerman 2008 pp 5 6 d the authors also state that a few hundred years ago rates of homicide were astronomical in christian europe and the american colonies 91 86 93 and the least theistic secular developing democracies such as japan france and scandinavia have been most successful in these regards 91 87 93 they argue for a positive correlation between the degree of public religiosity in a society and certain measures of dysfunction 91 88 93 an analysis published later in the same journal argues that a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions in the research 91 89 93 e blackburn provides examples such as the phrase in exodus 22 18 that has helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in europe and america thou shalt not suffer a witch to live and notes that the old testament god apparently has no problems with a slave owning society considers birth control a crime punishable by death and is keen on child abuse 91 90 93 others interpret these passages differently arguing for example that jewish laws show the evolution of moral standards in society that jews actually threatened those who pursued forced slavery with the death penalty held that slaves were persons instead of property and protected them in several ways 91
