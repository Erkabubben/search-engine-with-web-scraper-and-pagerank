psychopathy checklist from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search psychopathy scale this article is about the psychological assessment for the statistical test see p value cover the psychopathy checklist or hare psychopathy checklist revised now the psychopathy checklist revised pcl r is a psychological assessment tool that is commonly used to assess the presence and extent of the personality trait psychopathy in individuals most often those institutionalized in the criminal justice system and to differentiate those high in this trait from those with antisocial personality disorder a related diagnosable disorder 91 1 93 it is a 20 item inventory of perceived personality traits and recorded behaviors intended to be completed on the basis of a semi structured interview along with a review of collateral information such as official records 91 2 93 the pcl was originally developed in the 1970s by canadian psychologist robert d 160 hare 91 3 93 for use in psychology experiments based partly on hare s work with male offenders and forensic inmates in vancouver and partly on an influential clinical profile by american psychiatrist hervey m 160 cleckley first published in 1941 an individual s score may have important consequences for their future and because the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable hare argues that the test should be considered valid only if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under scientifically controlled and licensed standardized conditions 91 4 93 91 5 93 hare receives royalties on licensed use of the test 91 6 93 in psychometric terms the current version of the checklist has two factors sets of related scores that correlate about 0 5 with each other with factor one closer to cleckley s original personality concept than factor two hare s checklist does not incorporate the positive adjustment features that cleckley did 91 7 93 contents 1 pcl r model of psychopathy 2 items 3 use 3 1 screening and youth versions 4 comparison with psychiatric diagnoses 5 other pcl r findings and controversy 5 1 findings 5 2 controversy 6 criticism 7 notable evaluations 8 see also 9 references 10 further reading 11 external links pcl r model of psychopathy edit the pcl r is used for indicating a dimensional score or a categorical diagnosis of psychopathy for clinical legal or research purposes 91 4 93 it is rated by a mental health professional such as a psychologist or other professional trained in the field of mental health psychology or psychiatry using 20 items each of the items in the pcl r is scored on a three point scale according to specific criteria through file information and a semi structured interview the scores are used to predict risk for criminal re offense and probability of rehabilitation the current edition of the pcl r officially lists three factors 1 a 1 b and 2 a which summarize the 20 assessed areas via factor analysis the previous edition of the pcl r 91 8 93 listed two factors factor 1 is labelled selfish callous and remorseless use of others factor 2 is labelled as chronically unstable antisocial and socially deviant lifestyle there is a high risk of recidivism and mostly small likelihood of rehabilitation for those who are labelled as having psychopathy on the basis of the pcl r ratings in the manual for the test although treatment research is ongoing pcl r factors 1a and 1b are correlated with narcissistic personality disorder 91 9 93 they are associated with extraversion and positive affect factor 1 the so called core personality traits of psychopathy may even be beneficial for the psychopath in terms of nondeviant social functioning 91 10 93 pcl r factors 2a and 2b are particularly strongly correlated to antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder and are associated with reactive anger criminality and impulsive violence the target group for the pcl r in prisons in some countries is criminals convicted of delict and or felony the quality of ratings may depend on how much background information is available and whether the person rated is honest and forthright 91 9 93 91 10 93 items edit item 1 glibness superficial charm item 2 grandiose sense of self worth item 3 need for stimulation proneness to boredom item 4 pathological lying item 5 conning manipulative item 6 lack of remorse or guilt item 7 shallow affect item 8 callous lack of empathy item 9 parasitic lifestyle item 10 poor behavioral controls item 11 promiscuous sexual behavior item 12 early behavior problems item 13 lack of realistic long term goals item 14 impulsivity item 15 irresponsibility item 16 failure to accept responsibility for own actions item 17 many short term marital relationships item 18 juvenile delinquency item 19 revocation of conditional release item 20 criminal versatility each of the 20 items in the pcl r is scored on a three point scale with a rating of 0 if it does not apply at all 1 if there is a partial match or mixed information and 2 if there is a reasonably good match to the offender this is to be done through a face to face interview together with supporting information on lifetime behavior e g from case files it can take up to three hours to collect and review the information 91 11 93 out of a maximum score of 40 the cut off for the label of psychopathy is 30 in the united states and 25 in the united kingdom 91 11 93 91 12 93 a cut off score of 25 is also sometimes used for research purposes 91 11 93 high pcl r scores are positively associated with measures of impulsivity and aggression machiavellianism persistent criminal behavior and negatively associated with measures of empathy and affiliation 91 11 93 91 13 93 early factor analysis of the pcl r indicated it consisted of two factors factor 1 captures traits dealing with the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy e g shallow affect superficial charm manipulativeness lack of empathy whereas factor 2 deals with symptoms relating to antisocial behavior e g criminal versatility impulsiveness irresponsibility poor behavior controls juvenile delinquency 91 14 93 the two factors have been found by those following this theory to display different correlates factor 1 has been correlated with narcissistic personality disorder low anxiety 91 14 93 low empathy 91 15 93 low stress reaction 91 16 93 and low suicide risk 91 16 93 but high scores on scales of achievement and social potency 91 16 93 in addition the use of item response theory analysis of female offender pcl r scores indicates factor 1 items are more important in measuring and generalizing the construct of psychopathy in women than factor 2 items 91 17 93 in contrast factor 2 was found to be related to antisocial personality disorder social deviance sensation seeking low socioeconomic status 91 14 93 and high risk of suicide 91 16 93 the two factors are nonetheless highly correlated 91 14 93 and there are strong indications they do result from a single underlying disorder 91 18 93 research however has failed to replicate the two factor model in female samples 91 19 93 in 2001 researchers cooke and michie at glasgow caledonian university suggested using statistical analysis involving confirmatory factor analysis 91 20 93 that a three factor structure may provide a better model with those items from factor 2 strictly relating to antisocial behavior criminal versatility juvenile delinquency revocation of conditional release early behavioral problems and poor behavioral controls removed the remaining items would be divided into three factors arrogant and deceitful interpersonal style deficient affective experience and impulsive and irresponsible behavioral style 91 20 93 hare and colleagues have criticized the cooke and michie three factor model for statistical and conceptual problems for example for resulting in impossible parameter combinations negative variances 91 21 93 in the 2003 edition of the pcl r hare added a fourth antisocial behavior factor consisting of those factor 2 items excluded in the previous model 91 4 93 again these models are presumed to be hierarchical with a single unified psychopathy disorder underlying the distinct but correlated factors 91 22 93 in the four factor model of psychopathy supported by a range of samples the factors represent the interpersonal affective lifestyle and overt antisocial features of the personality disorder 91 23 93 use edit the pcl r is widely used to assess individuals in high security psychiatric units prisons and other settings 91 24 93 this may be of help in deciding who should be detained or released or who should undergo what kind of treatment it is also used in academic psychology for its original purpose as an assistive tool in studies on the pathology of psychopathy the pcl r is also used as a risk assessment tool that attempts to predict who will offend or reoffend recidivism it is effective in assessing risk of sexual re offending which is especially helpful as clinical judgement of recidivism is a poor predictor 91 25 93 the pcl r seems to be more useful for violent sexual offenders who are not pedophiles 91 25 93 in controlled research environments the inter rater reliability of the pcl r may be satisfactory but in real world settings it has been found to have rather poor agreement between different raters especially on the personality trait scores 91 26 93 screening and youth versions edit there are additional inventories directly from the pcl r including the psychopathy checklist screening version pcl sv and psychopathy checklist youth version pcl yv the pcl sv was developed as a labor saving assessment for the same forensic settings as the pcl r and to meet the needs of settings where clients do not necessarily have criminal records e g civil psychiatric patients it includes 12 items and takes 90 minutes according to the macarthur violence risk assessment study in 2014 there is a stronger correlation between the pcl sv results and later violence than any other of the 134 variables evaluated in that study 91 27 93 the pcl yv assesses early signs of juvenile psychopathy in children and adolescents 91 11 93 91 24 93 comparison with psychiatric diagnoses edit among laypersons and professionals there is confusion about the meanings and differences between psychopathy sociopathy antisocial personality disorder aspd and the icd 10 diagnosis dissocial personality disorder 91 28 93 hare takes the stance that psychopathy as a syndrome should be considered distinct from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders iv s antisocial personality disorder construct 91 29 93 although the dsm states aspd has been referred to as or includes the disorder of psychopathy 91 30 93 although the diagnosis of aspd covers two to three times as many prisoners than the diagnosis of psychopathy hare believes the pcl r is better able to predict future criminality violence and recidivism than a diagnosis of aspd 91 31 93 91 32 93 91 33 93 he suggests there are differences between pcl r diagnosed psychopaths and non psychopaths on processing and use of linguistic and emotional information while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with aspd and without 91 28 93 although hare wanted the dsm iv tr to list psychopathy as a unique disorder 91 29 93 the dsm editors were unconvinced and felt that there was too much room for subjectivity on the part of clinicians when identifying things like remorse and guilt therefore the dsm iv panel decided to stick to observable behavior namely socially deviant behaviors other pcl r findings and controversy edit findings edit according to hare one fbi study produced in 1992 found that 44 percent of offenders who killed a police officer were psychopaths 91 34 93 the study was killed in the line of duty a study of selected felonious killings of law enforcement officers 91 35 93 hare has described psychopaths as social predators remorseless predators 91 36 93 or in some cases lethal predators 91 37 93 and has stated that psychopathic depredations affect people in all races cultures and ethnic groups and at all levels of income and social status 91 38 93 a study using the pcl r to examine the relationship between antisocial behavior and suicide found that suicide history was strongly correlated to pcl r factor 2 reflecting antisocial deviance and was not correlated to pcl r factor 1 reflecting affective functioning given that aspd relates to factor 2 whereas psychopathy relates to both factors this would confirm hervey m cleckley s assertion that psychopaths are relatively immune to suicide people with aspd on the other hand have a relatively high suicide rate 91 16 93 controversy edit because an individual s scores may have important consequences for his or her future the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable the test can only be considered valid if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions 91 5 93 there has been controversy over the use of the pcl r by uk prison and secure psychiatric services including its role in the government s administrative category of dangerous and severe personality disorder a separate older administrative category of psychopathic disorder in the mental health act was abolished in 2007 one leading forensic psychologist while deputy chief at the ministry of justice has argued that it has not lived up to claims that it could identify those who would not benefit from current treatments or those most likely to violently reoffend 91 39 93 several recent studies and very large scale meta analysis 91 40 93 have cast serious doubt on whether the pcl r performs as well as other instruments or better than chance to the extent that it does perform better it is unclear whether it is due the pcl r s inclusion of past offending history rather than the personality trait scores that make it unique 91 41 93 criticism edit in addition to the aforementioned report by cooke and michie that a three factor structure may provide a better model than the two factor structure hare s concept and checklist have faced other criticisms 91 20 93 in 2010 there was controversy after it emerged that hare had threatened legal action that stopped publication of a peer reviewed article on the pcl r hare alleged the article quoted or paraphrased him incorrectly the article eventually appeared three years later it alleged that the checklist is wrongly viewed by many as the basic definition of psychopathy yet it leaves out key factors while also making criminality too central to the concept the authors claimed this leads to problems in over diagnosis and in the use of the checklist to secure convictions hare has since stated that he receives less than 35 000 a year from royalties associated with the checklist and its derivatives 91 42 93 hare s concept has also been criticised as being only weakly applicable to real world settings and tending towards tautology it is also said to be vulnerable to labeling effects to be over simplistic reductionist to embody fundamental attribution error and not pay enough attention to context and the dynamic nature of human behavior 91 43 93 it has been pointed out that half the criteria can also be signs of mania hypomania or frontal lobe dysfunction e g glibness superficial charm grandiosity poor behavioral controls promiscuous sexual behavior and irresponsibility 91 44 93 some research suggests that ratings made using the pcl system depend on the personality of the person doing the rating including how empathic they themselves are one forensic researcher has suggested that future studies need to examine the class background race and philosophical beliefs of raters because they may not be aware of enacting biased judgments of people whose section of society or individual lives for whom they have no understanding of or empathy 91 45 93 91 46 93 further a review which pooled various risk assessment instruments including the pcl found that peer reviewed studies for which the developer or translator of the instrument was an author which in no case was disclosed in the journal article were twice as likely to report positive predictive findings 91 47 93 notable evaluations edit lawrence bittaker was evaluated as 39 40 91 48 93 canadian serial killer duo paul bernardo and karla homolka were assessed using the checklist bernardo was evaluated as 35 40 and homolka 5 40 a malignant narcissist 91 49 93 ted bundy was evaluated as 39 40 91 50 93 jeffrey dahmer was evaluated as 23 40 91 50 93 brian dugan was
