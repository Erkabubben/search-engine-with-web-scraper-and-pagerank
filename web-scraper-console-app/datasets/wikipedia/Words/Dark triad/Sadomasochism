van loo 1761 the word sadomasochism is a portmanteau of the words sadism se d z m 91 1 93 and masochism 91 6 93 the two words incorporated into this compound sadism and masochism were originally derived from the names of two authors the term sadism has its origin in the name of the marquis de sade 1740 1814 who not only practised sexual sadism but also wrote novels about these practices of which the best known is justine masochism is named after leopold von sacher masoch 1836 1895 who wrote novels expressing his masochistic fantasies 91 7 93 these terms were first selected for identifying human behavioural phenomena and for the classification of psychological illnesses or deviant behaviour the german psychiatrist richard von krafft ebing introduced the terms sadism and masochism into medical terminology in his work neue forschungen auf dem gebiet der psychopathia sexualis new research in the area of psychopathology of sex in 1890 91 8 93 portrait of sacher masoch unknown author xix century in 1905 sigmund freud described sadism and masochism in his drei abhandlungen zur sexualtheorie three papers on sexual theory as stemming from aberrant psychological development from early childhood he also laid the groundwork for the widely accepted medical perspective on the subject in the following decades this led to the first compound usage of the terminology in sado masochism loureiroian sado masochismus by the viennese psychoanalyst isidor isaak sadger in his work ber den sado masochistischen komplex regarding the sadomasochistic complex in 1913 91 9 93 in the later 20th century bdsm activists have protested against these ideas because they argue they are based on the philosophies of the two psychiatrists freud and krafft ebing whose theories were built on the assumption of psychopathology and their observations of psychiatric patients the dsm nomenclature referring to sexual psychopathology has been criticized as lacking scientific veracity 91 10 93 and advocates of sadomasochism 91 who 93 have sought to separate themselves from psychiatric theory by the adoption of the term bdsm instead of the common psychological abbreviation s amp m 91 citation needed 93 however the term bdsm also includes b amp d bondage and discipline d s dominance and submission and s amp m sadism and masochism 91 citation needed 93 the terms bondage and discipline usually refer to the use of either physical or psychological restraint or punishment and sometimes involves sexual role playing including the use of costumes 91 citation needed 93

also clamped in contrast to frameworks seeking to explain sadomasochism through psychological psychoanalytic medical or forensic approaches which seek to categorize behavior and desires and find a root cause romana byrne suggests that such practices can be seen as examples of aesthetic sexuality in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant rather according to byrne sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style pleasure and identity which in certain circumstances she claims can be compared

sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message sadomasochism or the use of pain as a sexual stimulant has been practiced since ancient times with some scholars suggesting that it is an integral part of human culture 91 2 93 there are even those who propose that it is already present among nonhuman primate and primitive human communities before emerging in ancient cultures 91 12 93 one of the oldest surviving narratives that cited its practice was an egyptian love song sung by a man expressing a desire to be subjugated by a woman so he could experience pleasure as she treats him like a slave 91 2 93 the roman historian juvenal also described a case of a woman who submitted herself to the whipping and beating of the followers of pan 91 13 93 the modern conceptualization of sadomasochism stemmed from the terms sadism and masochism introduced to the medical field by german psychiatrist richard von krafft ebing in his 1886 compilation of case studies psychopathia sexualis pain and physical violence are not essential in krafft ebing s conception and he defined masochism german masochismus entirely in terms of control 91 14 93 sigmund freud a psychoanalyst and a contemporary of krafft ebing noted that both were often found in the same individuals and combined the two into a single dichotomous entity known as sadomasochism german sadomasochismus often abbreviated as s amp m or s m this observation is commonly verified in both literature and practice many practitioners both sadists and masochists define themselves as switches and switchable capable of taking and deriving pleasure in either role however french philosopher gilles deleuze argued that the concurrence of sadism and masochism proposed in freud s model is the result of careless reasoning and should not be taken for granted 91 15 93 freud introduced the terms primary and secondary masochism though this idea has come under a number of interpretations in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete rather than partial rejection by the model or courted object or sadist possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate this complete rejection is related to the death drive todestrieb in freud s psychoanalysis in a secondary masochism by contrast the masochist experiences a less serious more feigned rejection and punishment by the model secondary masochism in other words is the relatively casual version more akin to a charade and most commentators are quick to point out its contrivedness 91 citation needed 93 rejection is not desired by a primary masochist in quite the same sense as the feigned rejection occurring within a mutually consensual relationship or even where the masochist happens to be the one having actual initiative power in things hidden since the foundation of the world ren girard attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret freud s distinction of primary and secondary masochism in connection with his own philosophy 91 citation needed 93 both krafft ebing and freud assumed that sadism in men resulted from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct masochism in men however was seen as a more significant aberration contrary to the nature of male sexuality freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that it would be difficult to distinguish as a separate inclination 91 16 93 a submissive woman bound to a saint andrew s cross being whipped at the folsom street fair the red marks on her body are from the whipping havelock ellis in studies in the psychology of sex argued that there is no clear distinction between the aspects of sadism and masochism and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states he also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure and not in regard to cruelty as freud had suggested in other words the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love not in abuse for the pleasure of either one or both participants this mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved here ellis touches upon the often paradoxical nature of widely reported consensual s amp m practices it is described as not simply pain to initiate pleasure but violence or the simulation of involuntary violent acts said to express love this irony is highly evident in the observation by many that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist but that it is often the designated masochist who may direct such activities through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist 91 17 93 in his essay coldness and cruelty originally pr sentation de sacher masoch 1967 gilles deleuze rejects the term sadomasochism as artificial especially in the context of the quintessentially modern masochistic work sacher masoch s venus in furs deleuze s counterargument is that the tendency toward masochism is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification taken to its extreme an intolerably indefinite delay is rewarded by punitive perpetual delay manifested as unwavering coldness the masochist derives pleasure from as deleuze puts it the contract the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous the sadist in contrast derives pleasure from the law the unavoidable power that places one person below another the sadist attempts to destroy the ego in an effort to unify the id and super ego in effect gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego or of the conscience thus deleuze attempts to argue that masochism and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading a masochist s perception of their own self subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification for example in terms of psychology compulsively defensive appeasement of pathological guilt feelings as opposed to the volition of a strong free will the epilogue of venus in furs shows the character of severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of masochism and advocates instead the domination of women 91 original research 93 before deleuze however sartre had presented his own theory of sadism and masochism at which deleuze s deconstructive argument which took away the symmetry of the two roles was probably directed because the pleasure or power in looking at the victim figures prominently in sadism and masochism sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the look of the other sartre argued that masochism is an attempt by the for itself consciousness to reduce itself to nothing becoming an object that is drowned out by the abyss of the other s subjectivity 91 18 93 by this sartre means that given that the for itself desires to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected tested and humiliated and in this way the for itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship which would be both that of the abuser and the abused conversely sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim that means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object 91 citation needed 93 this argument may appear stronger if it is understood that this look of the other theory is either only an aspect of the faculties of desire or somehow its primary faculty this does not account for the turn that deleuze took for his own theory of these matters but the premise of desire as look is associated with theoretical distinctions always detracted by deleuze in what he regarded as its essential error to recognize desire as lack which he identified in the philosophical temperament of plato socrates and lacan for deleuze insofar as desire is a lack it is reducible to the look 91 citation needed 93 finally after deleuze ren girard included his account of sadomasochism in things hidden since the foundation of the world 1978 making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire in this view of sadomasochism the violence of the practices is an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love object there is clearly a similarity to deleuze since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by deleuze there is an understanding of the value of the love object in terms of the processes of its valuation acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor 91 original research 93 s amp m may involve painful acts such as cock and ball torture image shows a dominant woman holding a bound man s penis applying electricity to his testicles at the folsom street fair modern psychology edit there are a number of reasons commonly given for why a sadomasochist finds the practice of s amp m enjoyable and the answer is largely dependent on the individual for some taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape from the stresses of life from responsibility or from guilt for others being under the power of a strong controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood they likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure see servitude bdsm a sadist on the other hand may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist it is poorly understood though what ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification or how that connection initially forms 91 citation needed 93 dr joseph merlino author and psychiatry adviser to the new york daily news said in an interview that a sadomasochistic relationship as long as it is consensual is not a psychological problem it s a problem only if it is getting that individual into difficulties if he or she is not happy with it or it s causing problems in their personal or professional lives if it s not i m not seeing that as a problem but assuming that it did what i would wonder about is what is his or her biology that would cause a tendency toward a problem and dynamically what were the experiences this individual had that led him or her toward one of the ends of the spectrum 8201 joseph merlino 91 19 93 it is usually agreed on by psychologists that experiences during early sexual development can have a profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life sadomasochistic desires however seem to form at a variety of ages some individuals report having had them before puberty while others do not discover them until well into adulthood according to one study the majority of male sadomasochists 53 developed their interest before the age of 15 while the majority of females 78 developed their interest afterwards breslow evans and langley 1985 the prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown despite female sadists being less visible than males some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males 91 20 93 the results of such studies

both parties legally consent to such acts this may not be accepted as a defense against criminal charges very few jurisdictions will permit consent as a legitimate defense if serious bodily injuries

because they enjoy the experience instead the criminal justice system focuses on what it views as dangerous or violent behavior what this essentially means is that instead of attempting to understand and accommodate for voluntary sadomasochism the law typically views these incidences as cases of assault this can be seen with the well known case in great britain where 15 men were trialed for a range of offences relating to sadomasochism 91 38 93 samois the earliest known lesbian s m organization in the united states was founded in san francisco in 1978 91 39 93 91 40 93 harsh acts of s amp

impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning to the point that they can be considered part of a mental disorder however this is widely considered to be rare as
