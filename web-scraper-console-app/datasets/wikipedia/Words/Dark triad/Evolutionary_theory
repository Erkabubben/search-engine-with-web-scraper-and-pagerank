evolutionary biology 32 portal 160 categoryvte evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations 91 1 93 91 2 93 these characteristics are the expressions of genes which are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction variation tends to exist within any given population as a result of genetic mutation and recombination 91 3 93 evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection including sexual selection and genetic drift act on this variation resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or more rare within a population 91 4 93 the evolutionary pressures that determine whether a characteristic is common or rare within a population constantly change resulting in a change in heritable characteristics arising over successive generations it is this process of evolution that has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation including the levels of species individual organisms and molecules 91 5 93 91 6 93 the theory of evolution by natural selection was conceived independently by charles darwin and alfred russel wallace in the mid 19th century and was set out in detail in darwin s book on the origin of species 91 7 93 evolution by natural selection is established by observable facts about living organisms 1 more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive 2 traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology physiology and behaviour phenotypic variation 3 different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction differential fitness and 4 traits can be passed from generation to generation heritability of fitness 91 8 93 in successive generations members of a population are therefore more likely to be replaced by the offspring of parents with favourable characteristics in the early 20th century other competing ideas of evolution such as mutationism and orthogenesis were refuted as the modern synthesis concluded darwinian evolution acts on mendelian genetic variation 91 9 93 all life on earth shares a last universal common ancestor luca 91 10 93 91 11 93 91 12 93 which lived approximately 3 5 3 8 160 billion years ago 91 13 93 the fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite 91 14 93 to microbial mat fossils 91 15 93 91 16 93 91 17 93 to fossilised multicellular organisms existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped by repeated formations of new species speciation changes within species anagenesis and loss of species extinction throughout the evolutionary history of life on earth 91 18 93 morphological and biochemical traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor and these traits can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees 91 19 93 91 20 93 evolutionary biologists have continued to study various aspects of evolution by forming and testing hypotheses as well as constructing theories based on evidence from the field or laboratory and on data generated by the methods of mathematical and theoretical biology their discoveries have influenced not just the development of biology but numerous other

introduction to genetics genetics and heredity dna structure bases are in the centre surrounded by phosphate sugar chains in a double helix evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits the inherited characteristics of an organism in humans for example eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the brown eye trait from one of their parents 91 22 93 inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism s genome genetic material is called its genotype 91 23 93 the complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype these traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment 91 24 93 as a result many aspects of an organism s phenotype are not inherited for example suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person s genotype and sunlight thus suntans are not passed on to people s children however some people tan more easily than others due to differences in genotypic variation a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn 91 25 93 heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via dna a molecule that encodes genetic information 91 23 93 dna is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases the sequence of bases along a particular dna molecule specifies the genetic information in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence before a cell divides the dna is copied so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the dna sequence portions of a dna molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes different genes have different sequences of bases within cells the long strands of dna form condensed structures called chromosomes the specific location of a dna sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus if the dna sequence at a locus varies between individuals the different forms of this sequence are called alleles dna sequences can change through mutations producing new alleles if a mutation occurs within a gene the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls altering the phenotype of the organism 91 26 93 however while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci multiple interacting genes 91 27 93 91 28 93 some heritable changes cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the dna these phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems 91 29 93 dna methylation marking chromatin self sustaining metabolic loops gene silencing by rna interference and the three dimensional conformation of proteins such as prions are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level 91 30 93 developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation 91 31 93 heritability may also occur at even larger scales for example ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment this generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors 91 32 93 other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis 91 33 93 91 34 93 sources of variation main article genetic variation further information genetic diversity and population genetics white peppered mothblack morph in peppered moth evolution evolution can occur if there is genetic variation within a population variation comes from mutations in the genome reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations gene flow despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species 91 35 93 however even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype for example chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5 of their genomes 91 36 93 an individual organism s phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence of the environment it has lived in a substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation 91 28 93 the modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation the frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely 91 37 93 before the discovery of mendelian genetics one common hypothesis was blending inheritance but with blending inheritance genetic variation would be rapidly lost making evolution by natural selection implausible the hardy weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with mendelian inheritance the frequencies of alleles variations in a gene will remain constant in the absence of selection mutation migration and genetic drift 91 38 93 mutation main article mutation duplication of part of a chromosome mutations are changes in the dna sequence of a cell s genome and are the ultimate source of genetic variation in all organisms 91 3 93 when mutations occur they may alter the product of a gene or prevent the gene from functioning or have no effect based on studies in the fly drosophila melanogaster it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene this will probably be harmful with about 70 of these mutations having damaging effects and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial 91 39 93 mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated usually by genetic recombination which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome 91 40 93 extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve 91 41 93 this is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre existing genes that share common ancestors 91 42 93 for example the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light three for colour vision and one for night vision all four are descended from a single ancestral gene 91 43 93 new genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function this process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function 91 44 93 91 45 93 other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding dna a phenomenon termed de novo gene birth 91 46 93 91 47 93 the generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions exon shuffling 91 48 93 91 49 93 when new genes are assembled from shuffling pre existing parts domains act as modules with simple independent functions which can be mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions 91 50 93 for example polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process like a step in an assembly line 91 51 93 one example of mutation is wild boar piglets they are camouflage colored and show a characteristic pattern of dark and light longitudinal stripes however mutations in melanocortin 1 receptor mc1r disrupt the pattern the majority of pig breeds carry mc1r mutations disrupting wild type color and different mutations causing dominant black color of the pigs 91 52 93 sex and recombination further information sexual reproduction genetic recombination and evolution of sexual reproduction in asexual organisms genes are inherited together or linked as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction in contrast the offspring of sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment in a related process called homologous recombination sexual organisms exchange dna between two matching chromosomes 91 53 93 recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies but instead change which alleles are associated with each other producing offspring with new combinations of alleles 91 54 93 sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution 91 55 93 91 56 93 this diagram illustrates the twofold cost of sex if each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring two a the sexual population remains the same size each generation where the b asexual reproduction population doubles in size each generation 91 image reference needed 93 the two fold cost of sex was first described by john maynard smith 91 57 93 the first cost is that in sexually dimorphic species only one of the two sexes can bear young this cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species like most plants and many invertebrates the second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50 of its genes to any individual offspring with even less passed on as each new generation passes 91 58 93 yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms the red queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever changing environment 91 58 93 91 59 93 91 60 93 91 61 93 another hypothesis is that sexual reproduction is primarily an adaptation for promoting accurate recombinational repair of damage in germline dna and that increased diversity is a byproduct of this process that may sometimes be adaptively beneficial 91 62 93 91 63 93 gene flow further information gene flow gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species 91 64 93 it can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring this is most common among bacteria 91 65 93 in medicine this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species 91 66 93 horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil callosobruchus chinensis has occurred 91 67 93 91 68 93 an example of larger scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers which have received a range of genes from bacteria fungi and plants 91 69 93 viruses can also carry dna between organisms allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains 91 70 93 large scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and bacteria during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria it is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and archaea 91 71 93 evolutionary processes mutation followed by natural selection results in a population with darker colouration 91 image reference needed 93 from a neo darwinian perspective evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms 91 38 93 for example the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection genetic drift gene flow and mutation bias natural selection main article natural selection evolution by natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population it embodies three principles 91 8 93 variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology physiology and behaviour phenotypic variation different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction differential fitness these traits can be passed from generation to generation heritability of fitness more offspring are produced than can possibly survive and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction consequently organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage 91 72 93 this teleonomy is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform 91 73 93 consequences of selection include nonrandom mating 91 74 93 and genetic hitchhiking the central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism 91 75 93 fitness is measured by an organism s ability to survive and reproduce which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation 91 75 93 however fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism s genes 91 76 93 for example if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness 91 75 93 if an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population these traits are said to be selected for examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity conversely the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer they are selected against 91 77 93 importantly the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic if the environment changes previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful 91 26 93 however even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way traits that were lost in the past may not re evolve in an identical form see dollo s law 91 78 93 91 79 93 however a re activation of dormant genes as long as they have not been eliminated from the genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations can lead to the re occurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in dolphins teeth in chickens wings in wingless stick insects tails and additional nipples in humans etc throwbacks such as these are known as atavisms 91 80 93 these charts depict the different types of genetic selection on each graph the x axis variable is the type of phenotypic trait and the y axis variable is the number of organisms 91 image reference needed 93 group a is the original population and group b is the population after selection graph 1 shows directional selection in which a single extreme phenotype is favoured graph 2 depicts stabilizing selection where the intermediate phenotype is favoured over the extreme traits graph 3 shows disruptive selection in which the extreme phenotypes are favoured over the intermediate natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values such as height can be categorised into three different types the first is directional selection which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time for example organisms slowly getting taller 91 81 93 secondly disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common with selection against the average value this would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage but not those of medium height finally in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity 91 72 93 91 82 93 this would for example cause organisms to eventually have a similar height natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits are more or less likely to survive nature in this sense refers to an ecosystem that is a system in which organisms interact with every other element physical as well as biological in their local environment eugene odum a founder of ecology defined an ecosystem as any unit that includes all of the organisms in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity and material cycles i e exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts within the system 91 83 93 each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche or position with distinct relationships to other parts of the system these relationships involve the life history of the organism its position in the food chain and its geographic range this broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which together comprise natural selection natural selection can act at different levels of organisation such as genes cells individual organisms groups of organisms and species 91 84 93 91 85 93 91 86 93 selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously 91 87 93 an example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons which can replicate and spread throughout a genome 91 88 93 selection at a level above the individual such as group selection may allow the evolution of cooperation 91 89 93 genetic hitchhiking further information genetic hitchhiking hill robertson effect and selective sweep recombination allows alleles on the same strand of dna to become separated however the rate of recombination is low approximately two events per chromosome per generation as a result genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together a phenomenon known as linkage 91 90 93 this tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations which is called their linkage disequilibrium a set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype this can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft 91 91 93 genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size 91 92 93 sexual selection further information sexual selection male moor frogs become blue during the height of mating season blue reflectance may be a form of intersexual communication it is hypothesized that males with brighter blue coloration may signal greater sexual and genetic fitness 91 93 93 a special case of natural selection is sexual selection which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates 91 94 93 traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species although sexually favoured traits such as cumbersome antlers mating calls large body size and bright colours often attract predation which compromises the survival of individual males 91 95 93 91 96 93 this survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard to fake sexually selected traits 91 97 93 genetic drift further information genetic drift and effective population size simulation of genetic drift of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 top and 100 bottom drift to fixation is more rapid in the smaller population 91 image reference needed 93 genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies within a population from one generation to the next 91 98 93 when selective forces are absent or relatively weak allele frequencies are equally likely to drift upward or downward 91 clarification needed 93 in each successive generation because the alleles are subject to sampling error 91 99 93 this drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed either by disappearing from the population or by replacing the other alleles entirely genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone even in the absence of selective forces genetic drift can cause two separate populations that begin with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles 91 100 93 according to the now largely abandoned neutral theory of molecular evolution most evolutionary changes are the result of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift 91 101 93 in this model most genetic changes in a population are thus the result of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift 91 102 93 this form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned since it does not seem to fit the genetic variation seen in nature 91 103 93 91 104 93 a better supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory according to which a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population 91 72 93 other theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution such as genetic hitchhiking also known as genetic draft 91 99 93 91 92 93 91 105 93 another concept is constructive neutral evolution cne which explains that complex systems can emerge and spread into a population through neutral transitions due to the principles of excess capacity presuppression and ratcheting 91 106 93 91 107 93 91 108 93 and it has been applied in areas ranging from the origins of the spliceosome to the complex interdependence of microbial communities 91 109 93 91 110 93 91 111 93 the time it takes a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size fixation is more rapid in smaller populations 91 112 93 the number of individuals in a population is not critical but instead a measure known as the effective population size 91 113 93 the effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest 91 113 93 the effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population 91 114 93 it is usually difficult to measure the relative importance of selection and neutral processes including drift 91 115 93 the comparative importance of adaptive and non adaptive forces in driving evolutionary change is an area of current research 91 116 93 gene flow further information gene flow hybrid biology and horizontal gene transfer gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species 91 64 93 the presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution due to the complexity of organisms any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes as in the bateson dobzhansky muller model even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment 91 citation needed 93 if genetic differentiation between populations develops gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations eventually resulting in the appearance of new species thus exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept 91 citation needed 93 during the development of the modern synthesis sewall wright developed his shifting balance theory which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution 91 117 93 however recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory 91 118 93 mutation bias mutation bias is usually conceived as a difference in expected rates for two different kinds of mutation e g transition transversion bias gc at bias deletion insertion bias this is related to the idea of developmental bias haldane 91 119 93 and fisher 91 120 93 argued that because mutation is a weak pressure easily overcome by selection tendencies of mutation would be ineffectual except under conditions of neutral evolution or extraordinarily high mutation rates this opposing pressures argument was long used to dismiss the possibility of internal tendencies in evolution 91 121 93 until the molecular era prompted renewed interest in neutral evolution noboru sueoka 91 122 93 and ernst freese 91 123 93 proposed that systematic biases in mutation might be responsible for systematic differences in genomic gc composition between species the identification of a gc biased e coli mutator strain in 1967 91 124 93 along with the proposal of the neutral theory established the plausibility of mutational explanations for molecular patterns which are now common in the molecular evolution literature for instance mutation biases are frequently invoked in models of codon usage 91 125 93 such models also include effects of selection following the mutation selection drift model 91 126 93 which allows both for mutation biases and differential selection based on effects on translation hypotheses of mutation bias have played an important role in the development of thinking about the evolution of genome composition including isochores 91 127 93 different insertion vs deletion biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes 91 128 93 91 129 93 the hypothesis of lynch regarding genome size relies on mutational biases toward increase or decrease in genome size however mutational hypotheses for the evolution of composition suffered a reduction in scope when it was discovered that 1 gc biased gene conversion makes an important contribution to composition in diploid organisms such as mammals 91 130 93 and 2 bacterial genomes frequently have at biased mutation 91 131 93 contemporary thinking about the role of mutation biases reflects a different theory from that of haldane and fisher more recent work 91 121 93 showed that the original pressures theory assumes that evolution is based on standing variation when evolution depends on the introduction of new alleles mutational and developmental biases in the introduction can impose biases on evolution without requiring neutral evolution or high mutation rates 91 citation needed 93 several studies report that the mutations implicated in adaptation reflect common mutation biases 91 132 93 91 133 93 91 134 93 though others dispute this interpretation 91 135 93 applications main articles applications of evolution selective breeding and evolutionary computation concepts and models used in evolutionary biology such as natural selection have many applications 91 136 93 artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms this has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals 91 137 93 more recently such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate dna proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection for example modified enzymes and new antibodies in a process called directed evolution 91 138 93 understanding the changes that have occurred during an organism s evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders 91 139 93 for example the mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves 91 140 93 this helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation 91 141 93 evolutionary theory has many applications in medicine many human diseases are not static phenomena but capable of evolution viruses bacteria fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences as well as to pharmaceutical drugs 91 142 93 91 143 93 91 144 93 these same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide 91 145 93 and herbicide 91 146 93 resistance it is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics 91 147 93 and predicting the evolution and evolvability 91 148 93 of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level 91 149 93 in computer science simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection 91 150 93 artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of ingo rechenberg in the 1960s he used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems 91 151 93 genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of john henry holland 91 152 93 practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes 91 153 93 evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems 91 154 93 natural outcomes a visual demonstration of rapid antibiotic resistance evolution by e coli growing across a plate with increasing concentrations of trimethoprim 91 155 93 evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection these adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food avoiding predators or attracting mates organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis in the longer term evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed these outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species in particular speciation and extinction whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population in particular shifts in allele frequency and adaptation 91 156 93 macroevolution the outcome of long periods of microevolution 91 157 93 thus the distinction between micro and macroevolution is not a fundamental one the difference is simply the time involved 91 158 93 however in macroevolution the traits of the entire species may be important for instance a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats lessening the chance of it going extinct while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated in this sense microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels with microevolution acting on genes and organisms versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction 91 159 93 91 160 93 91 161 93 a common misconception is that evolution has goals long term plans or an innate tendency for progress as expressed in beliefs such as orthogenesis and evolutionism realistically however evolution has no long term goal and does not necessarily produce greater complexity 91 162 93 91 163 93 91 164 93 although complex species have evolved they occur as a side effect of the overall number of organisms increasing and simple forms of life still remain more common in the biosphere 91 165 93 for example the overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes which form about half the world s biomass despite their small size 91 166 93 and constitute the vast majority of earth s biodiversity 91 167 93 simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form of life on earth throughout its history and continue to be the main form of life up to the present day with complex life only appearing more diverse because it is more noticeable 91 168 93 indeed the evolution of microorganisms is particularly important to evolutionary research since their rapid reproduction allows the study of experimental evolution and the observation of evolution and adaptation in real time 91 169 93 91 170 93 adaptation further information adaptation homologous bones in the limbs of tetrapods the bones of these animals have the same basic structure but have been adapted for specific uses 91 image reference needed 93 adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat 91 171 93 91 172 93 also the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism s survival for example the adaptation of horses teeth to the grinding of grass by using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the product the bodily part or function the two senses of the word may be distinguished adaptations are produced by natural selection 91 173 93 the following definitions are due to theodosius dobzhansky adaptation is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats 91 174 93 adaptedness is the state of being adapted the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats 91 175 93 an adaptive trait is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing 91 176 93 adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature or the loss of an ancestral feature an example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell 91 177 93 other striking examples are the bacteria escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long term laboratory experiment 91 178 93 flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by products of nylon manufacturing 91 179 93 91 180 93 and the soil bacterium sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol 91 181 93 91 182 93 an interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection increasing organisms evolvability 91 183 93 91 184 93 91 185 93 91 186 93 a baleen whale skeleton letters a and b label flipper bones which were adapted from front leg bones while c indicates vestigial leg bones both suggesting an adaptation from land to sea 91 187 93 adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures consequently structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms this is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways the bones within bat wings for example are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor 91 188 93 however since all living organisms are related to some extent 91 189 93 even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity such as arthropod squid and vertebrate eyes or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function this is called deep homology 91 190 93 91 191 93 during evolution some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures 91 192 93 such structures may have little or no function in a current species yet have a clear function in ancestral species or other closely related species examples include pseudogenes 91 193 93 the non functional remains of eyes in blind cave dwelling fish 91 194 93 wings in flightless birds 91 195 93 the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes 91 187 93 and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction 91 196 93 examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth 91 197 93 the coccyx 91 192 93 the vermiform appendix 91 192 93 and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps 91 198 93 91 199 93 and primitive reflexes 91 200 93 91 201 93 91 202 93 however many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations structures originally adapted for one function but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process 91 203 93 one example is the african lizard holaspis guentheri which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices as can be seen by looking at its near relatives however in this species the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree an exaptation 91 203 93 within cells molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella 91 204 93 and protein sorting machinery 91 205 93 evolved by the recruitment of several pre existing proteins that previously had different functions 91 156 93 another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms eyes 91 206 93 91 207 93 an area of current investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations 91 208 93 this research addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features 91 209 93 these studies have shown that evolution can alter development to produce new structures such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals 91 210 93 it is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles 91 211 93 it is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes 91 212 93 coevolution further information coevolution common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis has evolved resistance to the defensive substance tetrodotoxin in its amphibian prey interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation when the interaction is between pairs of species such as a pathogen and a host or a predator and its prey these species can develop matched sets of adaptations here the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species these changes in the second species then in turn cause new adaptations in the first species this cycle of selection and response is called coevolution 91 213 93 an example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator the common garter snake in this predator prey pair an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake 91 214 93 cooperation further information co operation evolution not all co evolved interactions between species involve conflict 91 215 93 many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved for instance an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil 91 216 93 this is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis here the fungi actually grow inside plant cells allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system 91 217 93 coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved an extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects such as bees termites and ants where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce on an even smaller scale the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism which then supports a small number of the animal s germ cells to produce offspring here somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow remain as they are or die if cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately their uncontrolled growth causes cancer 91 218 93 such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of kin selection which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative s offspring 91 219 93 this activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity it is likely that its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on 91 220 93 other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms 91 221 93 speciation main article speciation further information assortative mating and panmixia the four geographic modes of speciation speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species 91 222 93 there are multiple ways to define the concept of species the choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned 91 223 93 for example some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms despite the diversity of various species concepts these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches interbreeding ecological and phylogenetic 91 224 93 the biological species concept is a classic example of the interbreeding approach defined by evolutionary biologist ernst mayr in 1942 the bsc states that species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups 91 225 93 despite its wide and long term use the bsc like others is not without controversy for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes 91 226 93 and this is called the species problem 91 223 93 some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species 91 223 93 91 224 93 barriers to reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor it may still be possible for them to produce offspring as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules 91 227 93 such hybrids are generally infertile in this case closely related species may regularly interbreed but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct however viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species or possess a totally new phenotype 91 228 93 the importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear although cases have been seen in many types of animals 91 229 93 with the gray tree frog being a particularly well studied example 91 230 93 speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions see laboratory experiments of speciation and in nature 91 231 93 in sexually reproducing organisms speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence there are four primary geographic modes of speciation the most common in animals is allopatric speciation which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically such as by habitat fragmentation or migration selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms 91 232 93 91 233 93 as selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed 91 234 93 the second mode of speciation is peripatric speciation which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment this differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population here the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes leading to rapid genetic change 91 235 93 the third mode is parapatric speciation this is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations instead speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations 91 222 93 generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species habitat one example is the grass anthoxanthum odoratum which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines 91 236 93 here plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil selection against interbreeding with the metal sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal resistant plants which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species as well as character displacement which is when two species become more distinct in appearance 91 237 93 geographical isolation of finches on the gal pagos islands produced over a dozen new species finally in sympatric speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat this form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population 91 238 93 generally sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and nonrandom mating to allow reproductive isolation to evolve 91 239 93 one type of sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species to produce a new hybrid species this is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile this is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair however it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes to form polyploids 91 240 93 this allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis since each parent s chromosomes are represented by a pair already 91 241 93 an example of such a speciation event is when the plant species arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species arabidopsis suecica 91 242 93 this happened about 20 000 years ago 91 243 93 and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process 91 244 93 indeed chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms 91 245 93 speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated equilibrium which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short bursts of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis where species remain relatively unchanged 91 246 93 in this theory speciation and rapid evolution are linked with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations as a result the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils 91 160 93 extinction further information extinction tyrannosaurus rex non avian dinosaurs died out in the cretaceous paleogene extinction event at the end of the cretaceous period extinction is the disappearance of an entire species extinction is not an unusual event as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction 91 247 93 nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on earth are now extinct 91 248 93 and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species 91 249 93 these extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events 91 250 93 the cretaceous paleogene extinction event during which the non avian dinosaurs became extinct is the most well known but the earlier permian triassic extinction event was even more severe with approximately 96 of all marine species driven to extinction 91 250 93 the holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity s expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years present day extinction rates are 100 1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30 of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century 91 251 93 human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event 91 252 93 91 253 93 global warming may further accelerate it in the future 91 254 93 despite the estimated extinction of more than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on earth 91 255 93 91 256 93 about 1 160 trillion species are estimated to be on earth currently with only one thousandth of one percent described 91 257 93 the role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of extinction is considered 91 250 93 the causes of the continuous low level extinction events which form the majority of extinctions may be the result of competition between species for limited resources the competitive exclusion principle 91 258 93 if one species can out compete another this could produce species selection with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction 91 85 93 the intermittent mass extinctions are also important but instead of acting as a selective force they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors 91 259 93 evolutionary history of life life timelinethis box viewtalkedit 8722 4500 160 8212 8211 8212 8211 8722 4000 160 8212 8211 8212 8211 8722 3500 160 8212 8211 8212

earth then it could be common in the universe 91 264 93 91 266 93 in july 2016 scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all organisms living on earth 91 267 93 more than 99 percent of all species amounting to over five billion species 91 268 93 that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct 91 255 93 91 256 93 estimates on the number of earth s current species range from 10 160 million to 14 160 million 91 269 93 91 270 93 of which about 1 9 160 million are estimated to have been named 91 271 93 and 1 6 160 million documented in a central database to date 91 272 93 leaving at least 80 percent not yet described highly energetic chemistry is thought to have produced a self replicating molecule around 4 160 billion years ago and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed 91 11 93 the current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions 91 273 93 91 274 93 the beginning of life may have included self replicating molecules such as rna 91 275 93 and the assembly of simple cells 91 276 93 common descent further information common descent and evidence of common descent all organisms on earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool 91 189 93 91 277 93 current species are a stage in the process of evolution with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events 91 278 93 the common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms first they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation second the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms but organisms that share morphological similarities third vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits fourth organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups similar to a family tree 91 279 93 the hominoids are descendants of a common ancestor due to horizontal gene transfer this tree of life may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species 91 280 93 91 281 93 to solve this problem and others some authors prefer to use the coral of life as a metaphor or a mathematical model to illustrate the evolution of life this view dates back to an idea briefly mentioned by darwin but later abandoned 91 282 93 past species have also left records of their evolutionary history fossils along with the comparative anatomy of present day organisms constitute the morphological or anatomical record 91 283 93 by comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species palaeontologists can infer the lineages of those species however this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts such as shells bones or teeth further as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry more recently evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms for example all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids 91 284 93 the development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms genomes dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations 91 285 93 for example these dna sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98 of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed 91 286 93 evolution of life main articles evolutionary

bacteria blue archaea green and eukaryotes red prokaryotes inhabited the earth from approximately 3 4 160 billion years ago 91 288 93 91 289 93 no obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms over the next few billion years 91 290 93 the eukaryotic cells emerged between 1 6 and 2 7 160 billion years ago the next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis 91 291 93 91 292 93 the engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes 91 293 93 another engulfment of cyanobacterial like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants 91 294 93 the history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 160 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the ediacaran period 91 288 93 91 295 93 the evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events in organisms as diverse as sponges brown algae cyanobacteria slime moulds and myxobacteria 91 296 93 in january 2016 scientists reported that about 800 160 million years ago a minor genetic change in a single molecule called gk pid may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells 91 297 93 soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 160 million years in an event called the cambrian explosion here the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct 91 298 93 various triggers for the cambrian explosion have been proposed including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis 91 299 93 about 500 160 million years ago plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals 91 300 93 insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species 91 301 93 amphibians first appeared around 364 160 million years ago followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 160 million years ago both from reptile like lineages mammals around 129 160 million years ago homininae around 10 160 million years ago and modern humans around 250 000 years ago 91 302 93 91 303 93 91 304 93 however despite the evolution of these large animals smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the earth with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes 91 167 93 history of evolutionary thought main article history of evolutionary thought further information history of speciation lucretius alfred russel wallace thomas robert malthus in 1842 charles darwin penned his first sketch of on the origin of species 91 305 93 classical antiquity the proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first pre socratic greek philosophers such as anaximander and empedocles 91 306 93 such proposals survived into roman times the poet and philosopher lucretius followed empedocles in his masterwork de rerum natura on the nature of things 91 307 93 91 308 93 middle ages in contrast to these materialistic views aristotelianism had considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities known as forms 91 309 93 91 310 93 this became part of a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the middle ages and were integrated into christian learning but aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one for one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be 91 311 93 a number of arab muslim scholars wrote about evolution most notably ibn khaldun who wrote the book muqaddimah in 1377 ad in which he asserted that humans developed from the world of the monkeys in a process by which species become more numerous 91 312 93 pre darwinian the new science of the 17th century rejected the aristotelian approach it sought to explain natural phenomena in terms of physical laws that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order however this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types john ray applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types species to plant and animal types but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation 91 313 93 the biological classification introduced by carl linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan 91 314 93 other naturalists of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws in 1751 pierre louis maupertuis wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species 91 315 93 georges louis leclerc comte de buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms and erasmus darwin proposed that all warm blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism or filament 91 316 93 the first full fledged evolutionary scheme was jean baptiste lamarck s transmutation theory of 1809 91 317 93 which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency and postulated that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents 91 318 93 the latter process was later called lamarckism 91 318 93 91 319 93 91 320 93 these ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support in particular georges cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs in the meantime ray s ideas of benevolent design had been developed by william paley into the natural theology or evidences of the existence and attributes of the deity 1802 which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by charles darwin 91 321 93 91 322 93 darwinian revolution the crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection which was formulated by charles darwin and alfred wallace in terms of variable populations darwin used the expression descent with modification rather than evolution 91 323 93 partly influenced by an essay on the principle of population 1798 by thomas robert malthus darwin noted that population growth would lead to a struggle for existence in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished in each generation many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources this could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism 91 324 93 91 325 93 91 326 93 91 327 93 darwin developed his theory of natural selection from 1838 onwards and was writing up his big book on the subject when alfred russel wallace sent him a version of virtually the same theory in 1858 their separate papers were presented together at an 1858 meeting of the linnean society of london 91 328 93 at the end of 1859 darwin s publication of his abstract as on the origin of species explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of darwin s concepts of evolution at the expense of alternative theories thomas henry huxley applied darwin s ideas to humans using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe 91 329 93 pangenesis and heredity the mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery towards this end darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis 91 330 93 in 1865 gregor mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements later known as genes mendel s laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of darwin s pangenesis theory 91 331 93 august weismann made the important distinction between germ cells that give rise to gametes such as sperm and egg cells and the somatic cells of the body demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only hugo de vries connected darwin s pangenesis theory to weismann s germ soma cell distinction and proposed that darwin s pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cell s structure de vries was also one of the researchers who made mendel s work well known believing that mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline 91 332 93 to explain how new variants originate de vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de vries 91 333 93 91 334 93 in the 1930s pioneers in the field of population genetics such as ronald fisher sewall wright and j b s haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy the false contradiction between darwin s theory genetic mutations and mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled 91 335 93 the modern synthesis main article modern synthesis 20th century in the 1920s and 1930s the so called modern synthesis connected natural selection and population genetics based on mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology it explained patterns observed across species in populations through fossil transitions in palaeontology 91 335 93 further syntheses since then further syntheses have extended evolution s explanatory power in the light of numerous discoveries to cover biological phenomena across the whole of the biological hierarchy from genes to populations 91 336 93 the publication of the structure of dna by james watson and francis crick with contribution of rosalind franklin in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance 91 337 93 molecular biology improved understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype advances were also made in phylogenetic systematics mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of evolutionary trees 91 338 93 in 1973 evolutionary biologist theodosius dobzhansky penned that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent explanatory body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet 91 339 93 one extension known as evolutionary developmental biology and informally called evo devo emphasises how changes between generations evolution act on patterns of change within individual organisms development 91 258 93 91 340 93 since the beginning of the 21st century some biologists have argued for an extended evolutionary synthesis which would account for the effects of non genetic inheritance modes such as epigenetics parental effects ecological inheritance and cultural inheritance and evolvability 91 341 93 91 342 93 social and cultural responses further information social effects of evolutionary theory 1860 oxford evolution debate rejection of evolution by religious groups objections to evolution and evolution in fiction as evolution became widely accepted in the 1870s caricatures of charles darwin with an ape or monkey body symbolised evolution 91 343 93 in the 19th century particularly after the publication of on the origin of species in 1859 the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical social and religious implications of evolution today the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists 91 258 93 however evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists 91 344 93 while various religions and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through concepts such as theistic evolution there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their religions and who raise various objections to evolution 91 156 93 91 345 93 91 346 93 as had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of vestiges of the natural history of creation in 1844 the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have the same types of natural causes as other inherited traits in animals 91 347 93 in some countries notably the united states these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation evolution controversy a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education 91 348 93 while other scientific fields such as cosmology 91 349 93 and earth science 91 350 93 also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists the teaching of evolution in american secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century the scopes trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in american secondary biology textbooks for a generation but it was gradually re introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 epperson v arkansas decision since then the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design id to be excluded once again in the 2005 kitzmiller v dover area school district case 91 351 93 the debate over darwin s ideas did not generate significant controversy in china 91 352 93 references hall amp hallgr msson 2008 pp 160 4 6 evolution resources washington dc
