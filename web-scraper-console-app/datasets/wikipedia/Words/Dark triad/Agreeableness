agreeableness from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search personality trait agreeableness is a personality trait manifesting itself in individual behavioral characteristics that are perceived as kind sympathetic cooperative warm and considerate 91 1 93 in contemporary personality psychology agreeableness is one of the five major dimensions of personality structure reflecting individual differences in cooperation and social harmony 91 2 93 people who score high on this dimension are empathetic and altruistic while a low agreeableness score relates to selfish behavior often manifesting as stinginess and a lack of empathy 91 3 93 91 4 93 those who score very low on agreeableness show signs of dark triad behavior such as manipulation and competing with others rather than cooperating 91 5 93 agreeableness is considered to be a superordinate trait meaning that it is a grouping of personality sub traits that cluster together statistically the lower level traits or facets grouped under agreeableness are trust straightforwardness altruism compliance modesty and tender mindedness 91 6 93 contents 1 history 1 1 cattell s 16 personality factors 1 2

factors edit agreeable burden fardeau agr able william adolphe bouguereau 1895 like all big five personality traits the roots of the modern concept of agreeableness can be traced to a 1936 study by gordon allport and henry s odbert 91 7 93 seven years later raymond cattell published a cluster analysis of the thousands of personality related words identified by allport and odbert 91 8 93 the clusters identified in this study served as a foundation for cattell s further attempts to identify fundamental universal human personality factors 91 9 93 he eventually settled on 16 personality factors through the use of factor analysis further factor analyses revealed five higher order or global factors to encompass these 16 91 10 93 although labelled independence by cattell a global factor defined by high scores on the e h l and q1 factors of the 16pf questionnaire was an early precursor to the modern concept of agreeableness 91 11 93 the big five edit extent of agreeableness in the five factor model of personality is most commonly assessed through self report measures although peer reports and third party observation can also be used self report measures are either lexical 91 1 93 or based on statements 91 12 93 which measure of either type is used is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect agreeableness or disagreeableness traits such as sympathetic cooperative warm considerate harsh unkind rude words representing disagreeableness are reverse coded goldberg 1992 91 13 93 developed a 20 word measure as part of his 100 word big five markers and saucier 1994 91 14 93 developed a briefer 8 word measure as part of his 40 word mini markers thompson 2008 91 1 93 systematically revised and improved these markers to develop a 40 word measure with better psychometric properties in both american and non american populations the international english mini markers this brief measure has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing agreeableness and other five factor personality dimensions both within and especially without american populations internal consistency reliability of the agreeableness measure for native english speakers is reported as 86 that for non native english speakers is 80 statement measures tend to comprise more words and hence consume more research instrument space than lexical measures respondents are asked the extent to which they for example am on good terms with nearly everyone am not interested in other people s problems or sympathize with others feelings 91 12 93 cattell s factor analytic approach used to identify the universal personality structures inspired countless studies in the decades following the introduction of the 16pf using cattell s original clusters the 16 personality factors and original data multiple researchers independently developed a five factor model of personality over this period from the early 1960s on these explorations typically included a factor called agreeableness or sociability 91 11 93 91 15 93 despite repeated replications of five stable personality factors following cattell s pioneering work this framework only began to dominate personality research in the early 1980s with the work of lewis goldberg using lexical studies similar to those of allport and odbert goldberg chose the term big five to reflect the sheer number of personality related terms encompassed by each of these five distinct factors 91 11 93 one of these agreeableness was defined by a number of personality related words similar to those present in earlier and more recent manifestations of the construct examples include friendly good natured cooperative trustful nurturing sociable and considerate 91 16 93 91 17 93 neo pi edit beginning in the 1970s paul costa and robert mccrae began researching the development of personality assessments based on factor models beginning with cluster analyses of cattell s 16 personality factors costa and mccrae initially settled on a three factor model of personality these three factors were neuroticism vs emotional stability extraversion vs introversion and openness vs closedness to experience resulting in the acronym neo 91 18 93 due to similarities between their three factor neo personality inventory and goldberg s big five costa and mccrae began to develop scales to assess agreeableness and conscientiousness in the early 1980s 91 11 93 this work culminated in the 1985 publication of the first neo pi manual to be based on the full five factor model 91 19 93 although this marked the introduction of agreeableness to the neo pi costa and mccrae worked for an additional seven years to identify and elaborate on the facets comprising this factor in the revised neo personality inventory 91 20 93 neo pi facets edit in the neo pi each of the five factors identified by costa and mccrae are identified with six lower level traits known as facets the lower level traits subsumed by agreeableness were first introduced with the 1992 publication of the revised version of the neo pi based on the modern neo pi r the six facets of agreeableness are trust straightforwardness altruism compliance modesty and tender mindedness 91 6 93 trust edit trust is a defining feature of psychosocial development personality theory and folk psychological conceptions of personality 91 21 93 individuals who score high on this facet generally believe others intentions to be benevolent those scoring low on this facet tend to be cynical and view others as suspicious dishonest or dangerous straightforwardness edit straightforwardness is the quality of directness and honesty in communicating with others despite a long history in moral philosophy straightforwardness is not as vital to personality theory as the other facets of agreeableness 91 21 93 those scoring high on straightforwardness tend to interact with others in a direct and honest manner low scorers are less direct tend to be high in self monitoring and are generally deceitful or manipulative although the two concepts are not identical those who score low on this facet tend to be high in machiavellianism 91 22 93 straightforwardness is similar to a dimension in the interpersonal circumplex called ingenuous versus calculating 91 21 93 according to michael c ashton and kibeom lee straightforwardness is similar to the honesty aspect of honesty humility in the hexaco model 91 23 93 altruism edit similar to altruism in animals and ethical altruism this facet is defined by measures of selflessness self sacrifice generosity and consideration courtesy and concern for others 91 21 93 altruism is similar to alfred adler s concept of social interest which is a tendency to direct one s actions toward the betterment of society 91 24 93 individuals who score low on altruism tend to be discourteous selfish or greedy a pattern of behaviors known as self interest in adlerian psychology compliance edit as a facet of agreeableness compliance is defined as an individual s typical response to conflict those who score high on compliance tend to be meek and mild and to prefer cooperation or deference as a means of resolving conflict low scorers tend to be aggressive antagonistic quarrelsome and vindictive 91 21 93 modesty edit while trust straightforwardness altruism and compliance all refer to interpersonal or social behaviors modesty refers to an individual s self concept those who score high on modesty tend to be humble and other focused while low scorers tend to be arrogant and self aggrandizing 91 21 93 low modesty is otherwise known as conceitedness or narcissism and in extreme cases can manifest as narcissistic personality disorder 91 25 93 otherwise known as humility in the revised neo personality inventory modesty resembles the humility aspect of honesty humility in the hexaco model 91 23 93 tender mindedness edit tender mindedness is defined as the extent to which an individual s judgments and attitudes are determined by emotion coined by william james this term was also prominent in early versions of the 16pf 91 21 93 tender mindedness is primarily defined by sympathy 91 26 93 and corresponds to the international personality item pool s sympathy scale 91 27 93 in contrast tough minded is a trait associated with psychoticism on the eysenck personality questionnaire 91 28 93 equivalents in psychobiological models edit models based on psychobiological theories of personality have each incorporated a factor similar to agreeableness in cloninger s temperament and character inventory the character trait known as cooperativeness is highly similar to and positively correlated with agreeableness 91 29 93 in zuckerman s alternative five model of personality the trait known as aggression hostility is inversely related to agreeableness 91 30 93 hexaco model edit to address the absence of measures of dark triad traits i e narcissism machiavellianism and psychopathy michael ashton and kibeom lee proposed the addition of a sixth factor to the five factor model 91 31 93 validated with psycholexical studies similar to those used in the development of the five factor model 91 32 93 the hexaco model adds honesty humility to five factors resembling those in the neo pi 91 33 93 although honesty humility does not directly correspond to any big five trait it is strongly correlated with the straightforwardness and modesty facets of big five agreeableness as both of these facets are only weakly correlated with big five agreeableness ashton and lee suggest dividing neo pi agreeableness into two factors similar to those in the hexaco model honesty humility i e straightforwardness and modesty and a redefined agreeableness trust altruism compliance and tender mindedness 91 23 93 reflecting this conception of honesty humility and hexaco agreeableness as unique though similar concepts ashton and lee propose that they represent different aspects of reciprocal altruism fairness honesty humility and tolerance agreeableness 91 34 93 despite suggesting this reconceptualization of agreeableness for the neo pi ashton and lee do not believe hexaco agreeableness is accurately captured by trust altruism compliance and tender mindedness in addition to accounting for these four facets of big five agreeableness the hexaco model s construction of agreeableness includes content categorized under neuroticism in the neo pi i e temperamentalness and irritability 91 35 93 to reflect the negative emotional content at the low end of hexaco agreeableness this factor is also referred to as agreeableness versus anger 91 34 93 the inclusion of anger in the definition of hexaco agreeableness further helps to differentiate this factor from honesty humility in response to offensive or transgressive actions individuals who score low on honesty humility tend not to respond immediately instead they defer their response by planning their revenge and waiting for the perfect opportunity to enact it although those who score low on hexaco agreeableness also employ this premeditated strategy they also tend to respond immediately with anger 91 36 93 hexaco agreeableness facets edit to help capture the numerous distinctions between the big five and hexaco models ashton and lee propose four new facet labels in their conceptualization of agreeableness forgiveness gentleness flexibility and patience 91 35 93 in addition to these four agreeableness specific facets lee and ashton have proposed an additional interstitial facet located in a space shared by agreeableness honesty humility and emotionality altruism versus antagonism 91 37 93 forgiveness a measure of an individual s response to deception or other transgressions individuals who score high on this facet tend to regain their trust and re establish friendly relations by forgiving the offender while those who score low tend to hold a grudge also known as forgivingness 91 38 93 gentleness a measure of how an individual typically evaluates others individuals who score high on this facet tend to avoid being overly judgmental while those who score low are highly critical and judgmental flexibility a measure of behaviors related to compromise and cooperation individuals who score high on this facet prefer cooperation and compromise as means of resolving disagreement while those who score low tend to be stubborn argumentative and unwilling to accommodate others patience a measure of one s response to anger and aggravation individuals who score high on this facet tend to be able to tolerate very high levels of anger and maintain their composure while expressing anger those who score low on patience have difficulties remaining calm while expressing their anger and tend to have quick tempers becoming very angry in response to comparatively little provocation altruism versus antagonism although shared between three hexaco factors altruism versus antagonism is moderately correlated with agreeableness 91 37 93 this interstitial facet assesses the extent to which an individual is sympathetic soft hearted and helpful with low scoring individuals tending toward an antagonistic interpersonal style interpersonal relations edit agreeableness is an asset in situations that require getting along with others compared to disagreeable persons agreeable individuals display a tendency to perceive others in a more positive light because agreeable children are more sensitive to the needs and perspectives of others they are less likely to suffer from social rejection specifically research indicates that children who are less disruptive less aggressive and more skilled at entering play groups are more likely to gain acceptance by their peers 91 39 93 one study found that people high in agreeableness are more emotionally responsive in social situations this effect was measured on both self report questionnaires and physiological measures and offers evidence that extraversion and neuroticism are not the only big five personality factors that influence emotion the effect was especially pronounced among women 91 40 93 research also shows that people high in agreeableness are more likely to control negative emotions like anger in conflict situations those who are high in agreeableness are more likely to use conflict avoidant tactics when in conflict with others whereas people low in agreeableness are more likely to use coercive tactics 91 41 93 they are also more willing to give ground to their adversary and may lose arguments with people who are less agreeable from their perspective they have not really lost an argument as much as maintained a congenial relationship with another person 91 42 93 prosocial behaviour edit a central feature of agreeableness is its positive association with altruism and helping behaviour across situations people who are high in agreeableness are more likely to report an interest and involvement with helping others experiments have shown that most people are likely to help their own kin and help when empathy has been aroused agreeable people are likely to help even when these conditions are not present 91 43 93 in other words agreeable people appear to be traited for helping 91 44 93 and do not need any other motivations while agreeable individuals are habitually likely to help others disagreeable people may be more likely to cause harm researchers have found that low levels of agreeableness are associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents as well as poor social adjustment 91 45 93 people low in agreeableness are also more likely to be prejudiced against stigmatized groups such as the overweight 91 46 93 when mental illness is present low agreeableness may be associated with narcissistic and anti social tendencies 91 47 93 in theory individuals who are extremely high in agreeableness are at risk for problems of dependency empirical studies show that many more problems are associated with low agreeableness however high agreeableness does not always lead to prosocial behaviour in a milgram experiment conscientious and agreeable people when forced by ill intent authority are more willing to administer high intensity electric shocks to a victim because conscientious and agreeable people are less capable of resistance 91 48 93 from childhood to adulthood edit agreeableness is of fundamental importance to psychological well being predicting mental health positive affect and good relations with others in both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues along with this it has also been implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills school adjustment peer social status and self esteem some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood among young adults individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion and higher levels of negative emotionality than those young adults without such disorders agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults among college students agreeableness is often associated with self reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli across adulthood low agreeableness has been found to be a health risk high agreeableness especially trust and honesty has been linked to longevity 91 49 93 a study done by caspi elder and bem 1987 found that explosive and ill tempered children were found to have higher rates of divorce as adults when compared with their even tempered peers further ill tempered men had lower educational attainment occupational status and work stability and ill tempered women married men with similar low achievement profiles 91 50 93 a second and more recent study by shiner 2000 found that composite variables describing middle childhood agreeableness and friendly compliance predicted adolescent academic performance behavioral conduct and social competence 10 years later 91 51 93 geography edit united states edit agreeableness by state lighter regions have lower average agreeableness see also list of u s states ranked per five factor model personality trait in the united states people in the west midwest and south tend to have higher average scores on agreeableness than people living in other regions 91 52 93 according to researchers the top ten most agreeable states are north dakota minnesota mississippi utah wisconsin tennessee north carolina georgia oklahoma and nebraska 91 53 93 these findings are consistent with well known expressions in these states such as southern hospitality and minnesota nice because these states are generally less urbanized than the east and west coasts people may be more likely to live in small communities and know their neighbors consequently they may be more willing to care about and help their neighbours in a study done by albright et al 1997 groups of college students from china and the united states rated strangers from both countries on the big five personality traits external traits and how well they were dressed they found that both chinese and u s students rated faces as showing similar levels of agreeableness and extroversion the people who were thought to be the most agreeable wore smiles a facial expression that is recognized around the world 91 54 93 the findings of the research seem to suggest that the trait of agreeableness is attributed to people in a universal way 91 55 93 see also edit trait theory lexical
