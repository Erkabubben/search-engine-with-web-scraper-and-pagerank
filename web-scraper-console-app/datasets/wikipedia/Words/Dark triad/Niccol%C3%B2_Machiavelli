as nicholas machiavel m ki v l mak ee vel us also m k mahk see below was an italian diplomat author philosopher and historian who lived during the renaissance he is best known for his political treatise the prince il principe written in about 1513 but not published until 1532 91 8 93 he has often been called the father of modern political philosophy and political science 91 9 93 for many years he served as a senior official in the florentine republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs he wrote comedies carnival songs and poetry his personal correspondence is also important to historians and scholars of italian correspondence 91 10 93 he worked as secretary to the second chancery of the republic of florence from 1498 to 1512 when the medici were out of power after his death machiavelli s name came to evoke unscrupulous acts of the sort he advised most famously in his work the prince 91 11 93 he claimed that his experience and reading of history showed him that politics have always been played with deception treachery and crime 91 12 93 he also notably said that a ruler who is establishing a kingdom or a republic and is criticized for his deeds including violence should be excused when the intention and the result is beneficial to him 91 13 93 91 14 93 91 15 93 machiavelli s prince has been surrounded by controversy since its release some considered it to be a straightforward description of the evil means used by bad rulers many read in it evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power 91 16 93 even into recent times some scholars such as leo strauss have restated the traditional opinion that machiavelli was a teacher of evil 91 17 93 the term machiavellian often connotes political deceit deviousness and realpolitik even though machiavelli has become most famous for his work on principalities scholars also give attention to the exhortations in his other works of political philosophy while much less well known than the prince the discourses on livy composed c 8201 1517 has been said to have paved the way of modern republicanism 91 18 93 it has also significantly influenced authors who have

son of attorney bernardo di niccol machiavelli and his wife bartolomea di stefano nelli 91 21 93 the machiavelli family is believed to be descended from the old marquesses of tuscany and to have produced thirteen florentine gonfalonieres of justice 91 22 93 one of the offices of a group of nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months and who formed the government or signoria he was never though a full citizen of florence because of the nature of florentine citizenship in that time even under the republican regime machiavelli married marietta corsini in 1502 91 23 93 machiavelli was born in a tumultuous era the italian city states and the families and individuals who ran them could rise and fall suddenly as popes and the kings of france spain and the holy roman empire waged acquisitive wars for regional influence and control political military alliances continually changed featuring condottieri mercenary leaders who changed sides without warning and the rise and fall of many short lived governments 91 24 93 machiavelli was taught grammar rhetoric and latin by his teacher paolo da ronciglione 91 25 93 it is unknown whether machiavelli knew greek even though florence was at the time one of the centers of greek scholarship in europe 91 26 93 in 1494 florence restored the republic expelling the medici family that had ruled florence for some sixty years shortly after the execution of savonarola machiavelli was appointed to an office of the second chancery a medieval writing office that put machiavelli in charge of the production of official florentine government documents 91 27 93 shortly thereafter he was also made the secretary of the dieci di libert e pace in the first decade of the sixteenth century he carried out several diplomatic missions most notably to the papacy in rome florence sent him to pistoia to pacify the leaders of two opposing factions which had broken into riots in 1501 and 1502 when this failed the leaders were banished from the city a strategy which machiavelli had favored from the outset 91 28 93 from 1502 to 1503 he witnessed the brutal reality of the state building methods of cesare borgia 1475 1507 and his father pope alexander vi who were then engaged in the process of trying to bring a large part of central italy under their possession 91 29 93 the pretext of defending church interests was used as a partial justification by the borgias other excursions to the court of louis xii and the spanish court influenced his writings such as the prince at the start of the 16th century machiavelli conceived of a militia for florence and he then began recruiting and creating it 91 30 93 he distrusted mercenaries a distrust that he explained in his official reports and then later in his theoretical works for their unpatriotic and uninvested nature in the war that makes their allegiance fickle and often unreliable when most needed 91 31 93 and instead staffed his army with citizens a policy that was to be repeatedly successful by february 1506 he was able to have marching on parade four hundred farmers suited including iron breastplates and armed with lances and small fire arms 91 30 93 under his command florentine citizen soldiers defeated pisa in 1509 91 32 93 machiavelli s tomb in the santa croce church in florence machiavelli s success did not last in august 1512 the medici backed by pope julius ii used spanish troops to defeat the florentines at prato 91 33 93 in the wake of the siege soderini resigned as florentine head of state and left in exile the experience would like machiavelli s time in foreign courts and with the borgia heavily influence his political writings the florentine city state and the republic were dissolved and machiavelli was deprived of office and banished from the city for a year 91 34 93 in 1513 the medici accused him of conspiracy against them and had him imprisoned 91 35 93 despite being subjected to torture 91 34 93 with the rope in which the prisoner is hanged from his bound wrists from the back forcing the arms to bear the body s weight and dislocating the shoulders he denied involvement and was released after three weeks machiavelli then retired to his farm estate at sant andrea in percussina near san casciano in val di pesa where he devoted himself to studying and writing his political treatises he visited places in france germany and italy where he had represented the florentine republic 91 34 93 despairing of the opportunity to remain directly involved in political matters after a time he began to participate in intellectual groups in florence and wrote several plays that unlike his works on political theory were both popular and widely known in his lifetime politics remained his main passion and to satisfy this interest he maintained a well known correspondence with more politically connected friends attempting to become involved once again in political life 91 36 93 in a letter to francesco vettori he described his experience when evening comes i go back home and go to my study on the threshold i take off my work clothes covered in mud and filth and i put on the clothes an ambassador would wear decently dressed i enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died there i am warmly welcomed and i feed on the only food i find nourishing and was born to savour i am not ashamed to talk to them and ask them to explain their actions and they out of kindness answer me four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety i forget every worry i am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death i live entirely through them 91 37 93 machiavelli died on 21 june 1527 at the age of 58 after receiving his last rites 91 38 93 91 39 93 he was buried at the church of santa croce in florence in 1789 george nassau clavering and pietro leopoldo grand duke of tuscany initiated the construction of a monument on machiavelli s tomb it was sculpted by innocenzo spinazzi with an epitaph by doctor ferroni inscribed on it 91 40 93 the latin legend reads tanto nomini nullum par elogium so great a name has no adequate praise or no eulogy would be a match for such a great name or there is no praise equal to so great a name major works edit the prince edit main article the prince lorenzo di piero de medici to whom the final version of the prince was dedicated machiavelli s best known book il principe contains several maxims concerning politics instead of the more traditional target audience of a hereditary prince it concentrates on the possibility of a new prince to retain power the hereditary prince must carefully balance the interests of a variety of institutions to which the people are accustomed 91 41 93 by contrast a new prince has the more difficult task in ruling he must first stabilise his newfound power in order to build an enduring political structure machiavelli suggests that the social benefits of stability and security can be achieved in the face of moral corruption machiavelli believed that public and private morality had to be understood as two different things in order to rule well 91 42 93 as a result a ruler must be concerned not only with reputation but also must be positively willing to act unscrupulously at the right times machiavelli believed that for a ruler it was better to be widely feared than to be greatly loved a loved ruler retains authority by obligation while a feared leader rules by fear of punishment 91 43 93 as a political theorist machiavelli emphasized the necessity for the methodical exercise of brute force or deceit including extermination of entire noble families to head off any chance of a challenge to the prince s authority 91 44 93 scholars often note that machiavelli glorifies instrumentality in state building an approach embodied by the saying often attributed to interpretations of the prince the ends justify the means 91 45 93 fraud and deceit are held by machiavelli as necessary for a prince to use 91 46 93 violence may be necessary for the successful stabilization of power and introduction of new political institutions force may be used to eliminate political rivals to destroy resistant populations and to purge the community of other men strong enough of a character to rule who will inevitably attempt to replace the ruler 91 47 93 machiavelli has become infamous for such political advice ensuring that he would be remembered in history through the adjective machiavellian 91 48 93 due to the treatise s controversial analysis on politics the catholic church banned the prince putting it on the index librorum prohibitorum humanists also viewed the book negatively including erasmus of rotterdam as a treatise its primary intellectual contribution to the history of political thought is the fundamental break between political realism and political idealism due to it being a manual on acquiring and keeping political power in contrast with plato and aristotle machiavelli insisted that an imaginary ideal society is not a model by which a prince should orient himself concerning the differences and similarities in machiavelli s advice to ruthless and tyrannical princes in the prince and his more republican exhortations in discourses on livy a few commentators assert that the prince although written as advice for a monarchical prince contains arguments for the superiority of republican regimes similar to those found in the discourses in the 18th century the work was even called a satire for example by jean jacques rousseau 91 49 93 91 50 93 scholars such as leo strauss and harvey mansfield have stated that sections of the prince and his other works have deliberately esoteric statements throughout them 91 51 93 however mansfield states that this is the result of machiavelli s seeing grave and serious things as humorous because they are manipulable by men and sees them as grave because they answer human necessities 91 52 93 another interpretation is that of antonio gramsci who argued that machiavelli s audience for this work was not even the ruling class but the common people because rulers already knew these methods through their education discourses on livy edit main article discourses on livy the discourses on the first ten books of titus livius written around 1517 published in 1531 often referred to simply as the discourses or discorsi is nominally a discussion regarding the classical history of early ancient rome although it strays very far from this subject matter and also uses contemporary political examples to illustrate points machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured it is a much larger work than the prince and while it more openly explains the advantages of republics it also contains many similar themes from his other works 91 53 93 for example machiavelli has noted that to save a republic from corruption it is necessary to return it to a kingly state using violent means 91 54 93 he excuses romulus for murdering his brother remus and co ruler titus tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he established a civil way of life 91 55 93 commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other as machiavelli frequently refers to leaders of republics as princes 91 56 93 machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants 91 57 93 91 58 93 other scholars have pointed out the aggrandizing and imperialistic features of machiavelli s republic 91 59 93 nevertheless it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism and has often been argued to be a more comprehensive work than the prince 91 60 93 originality edit engraved portrait of machiavelli from the peace palace library s il principe published in 1769 commentators have taken very different approaches to machiavelli and not always agreed major discussion has tended to be about two issues first how unified and philosophical his work is and second concerning how innovative or traditional it is 91 61 93 coherence edit there is some disagreement concerning how best to describe the unifying themes if there are any that can be found in machiavelli s works especially in the two major political works the prince and discourses some commentators have described him as inconsistent and perhaps as not even putting a high priority in consistency 91 61 93 others such as hans baron have argued that his ideas must have changed dramatically over time some have argued that his conclusions are best understood as a product of his times experiences and education others such as leo strauss and harvey mansfield have argued strongly that there is a very strong and deliberate consistency and distinctness even arguing that this extends to all of machiavelli s works including his comedies and letters 91 61 93 91 62 93 influences edit commentators such as leo strauss have gone so far as to name machiavelli as the deliberate originator of modernity itself others have argued that machiavelli is only a particularly interesting example of trends which were happening around him in any case machiavelli presented himself at various times as someone reminding italians of the old virtues of the romans and greeks and other times as someone promoting a completely new approach to politics 91 61 93 that machiavelli had a wide range of influences is in itself not controversial their relative importance is however a subject of on going discussion it is possible to summarize some of the main influences emphasized by different commentators i the mirror of princes genre gilbert 1938 summarized the similarities between the prince and the genre it obviously imitates the so called mirror of princes style this was a classically influenced genre with models at least as far back as xenophon and isocrates while gilbert emphasized the similarities however he agreed with all other commentators that machiavelli was particularly novel in the way he used this genre even when compared to his contemporaries such as baldassare castiglione and erasmus one of the major innovations gilbert noted was that machiavelli focused upon the deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom normally these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes xenophon is also an exception in this regard ii classical republicanism commentators such as quentin skinner and j g a pocock in the so called cambridge school of interpretation have asserted that some of the republican themes in machiavelli s political works particularly the discourses on livy can be found in medieval italian literature which was influenced by classical authors such as sallust 91 63 93 91 64 93 iii classical political philosophy xenophon plato and aristotle xenophon author of the cyropedia the socratic school of classical political philosophy especially aristotle had become a major influence upon european political thinking in the late middle ages it existed both in the catholicised form presented by thomas aquinas and in the more controversial averroist form of authors like marsilius of padua machiavelli was critical of catholic political thinking and may have been influenced by averroism but he rarely cites plato and aristotle and most likely did not approve of them leo strauss argued that the strong influence of xenophon a student of socrates more known as an historian rhetorician and soldier was a major source of socratic ideas for machiavelli sometimes not in line with aristotle while interest in plato was increasing in florence during machiavelli s lifetime machiavelli does not show particular interest in him but was indirectly influenced by his readings of authors such as polybius plutarch and cicero the major difference between machiavelli and the socratics according to strauss is machiavelli s materialism and therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics with their teleological understanding of things socratics argued that by nature everything that acts acts towards some end as if nature desired them but machiavelli claimed that such things happen by blind chance or human action 91 65 93 iv classical materialism strauss argued that machiavelli may have seen himself as influenced by some ideas from classical materialists such as democritus epicurus and lucretius strauss however sees this also as a sign of major innovation in machiavelli because classical materialists did not share the socratic regard for political life while machiavelli clearly did 91 65 93 v thucydides some scholars note the similarity between machiavelli and the greek historian thucydides since both emphasized power politics 91 66 93 91 67 93 strauss argued that machiavelli may indeed have been influenced by pre socratic philosophers but he felt it was a new combination contemporary readers are reminded by machiavelli s teaching of thucydides they find in both authors the same realism i e the same denial of the power of the gods or of justice and the same sensitivity to harsh necessity and elusive chance yet thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base therefore thucydides history arouses in the reader a sadness which is never aroused by machiavelli s books in machiavelli we find comedies parodies and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy one half of humanity remains outside of his thought there is no tragedy in machiavelli because he has no sense of the sacredness of the common strauss 1958 p 160 292 beliefs edit amongst commentators there are a few consistently made proposals concerning what was most new in machiavelli s work empiricism and realism versus idealism edit machiavelli is sometimes seen as the prototype of a modern empirical scientist building generalizations from experience and historical facts and emphasizing the uselessness of theorizing with the imagination 91 61 93 he emancipated politics from theology and moral philosophy he undertook to describe simply what rulers actually did and thus anticipated what was later called the scientific spirit in which questions of good and bad are ignored and the observer attempts to discover only what really happens 8201 joshua kaplan 2005 91 68 93 machiavelli felt that his early schooling along the lines of a traditional classical education was essentially useless for the purpose of understanding politics nevertheless he advocated intensive study of the past particularly regarding the founding of a city which he felt was a key to understanding its later development 91 68 93 moreover he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live machiavelli denies the classical opinion that living virtuously always leads to happiness for example machiavelli viewed misery as one of the vices that enables a prince to rule 91 69 93 machiavelli stated that it would be best to be both loved and feared but since the two rarely come together anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved 91 70 93 in much of machiavelli s work he often states that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime a related and more controversial proposal often made is that he described how to do things in politics in a way which seemed neutral concerning who used the advice tyrants or good rulers 91 61 93 that machiavelli strove for realism is not doubted but for four centuries scholars have debated how best to describe his morality the prince made the word machiavellian a byword for deceit despotism and political manipulation leo strauss declared himself inclined toward the traditional view that machiavelli was self consciously a teacher of evil since he counsels the princes to avoid the values of justice mercy temperance wisdom and love of their people in preference to the use of cruelty violence fear and deception 91 71 93 strauss takes up this opinion because he asserted that failure to accept the traditional opinion misses the intrepidity of his thought and the graceful subtlety of his speech 91 72 93 italian anti fascist philosopher benedetto croce 1925 concludes machiavelli is simply a realist or pragmatist who accurately states that moral values in reality do not greatly affect the decisions that political leaders make 91 73 93 german philosopher ernst cassirer 1946 held that machiavelli simply adopts the stance of a political scientist a galileo of politics in distinguishing between the facts of political life and the values of moral judgment 91 74 93 on the other hand walter russell mead has argued that the prince 39 s advice presupposes the importance of ideas like legitimacy in making changes to the political system 91 75 93 fortune edit machiavelli is generally seen as being critical of christianity as it existed in his time specifically its effect upon politics and also everyday life 91 76 93 in his opinion christianity along with the teleological aristotelianism that the church had come to accept allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary ideals and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to providence or as he would put it chance luck or fortune while christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful machiavelli took a more classical position seeing ambition spiritedness and the pursuit of glory as good and natural things and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have therefore while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues especially prudence machiavelli s use of the words virt and prudenza was unusual for his time implying a spirited and immodest ambition mansfield describes his usage of virtu as a compromise with evil 91 77 93 famously machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future in the place of allowing fortune to do so najemy 1993 has argued that this same approach can be found in machiavelli s approach to love and desire as seen in his comedies and correspondence najemy shows how machiavelli s friend vettori argued against machiavelli and cited a more traditional understanding of fortune on the other hand humanism in machiavelli s time meant that classical pre christian ideas about virtue and prudence including the possibility of trying to control one s future were not unique to him but humanists did not go so far as to promote the extra glory of deliberately aiming to establish a new state in defiance of traditions and laws while machiavelli s approach had classical precedents it has been argued that it did more than just bring back old ideas and that machiavelli was not a typical humanist strauss 1958 argues that the way machiavelli combines classical ideas is new while xenophon and plato also described realistic politics and were closer to machiavelli than aristotle was they like aristotle also saw philosophy as something higher than politics machiavelli was apparently a materialist who objected to explanations involving formal and final causation or teleology machiavelli s promotion of ambition among leaders while denying any higher standard meant that he encouraged risk taking and innovation most famously the founding of new modes and orders his advice to princes was therefore certainly not limited to discussing how to maintain a state it has been argued that machiavelli s promotion of innovation led directly to the argument for progress as an aim of politics and civilization but while a belief that humanity can control its own future control nature and progress has been long lasting machiavelli s followers starting with his own friend guicciardini have tended to prefer peaceful progress through economic development and not warlike progress as harvey mansfield 1995 p 160 74 wrote in attempting other more regular and scientific modes of overcoming fortune machiavelli s successors formalized and emasculated his notion of virtue machiavelli however along with some of his classical predecessors saw ambition and spiritedness and therefore war as inevitable and part of human nature strauss concludes his 1958 book thoughts on machiavelli by proposing that this promotion of progress leads directly to the advent of new technologies being invented in both good and bad governments strauss argued that the unavoidable nature of such arms races which have existed before modern times and led to the collapse of peaceful civilizations show that classical minded men had to admit in other words that in an important respect the good city has to take its bearings by the practice of bad cities or that the bad impose their law on the good strauss 1958 pp 160 298 299 religion edit machiavelli shows repeatedly that he saw religion as man made and that the value of religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be dispensed with if security requires it 91 78 93 91 79 93 in the prince the discourses and in the life of castruccio castracani he describes prophets as he calls them like moses romulus cyrus the great and theseus he treated pagan and christian patriarchs in the same way as the greatest of new princes the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics and men whom machiavelli assures us have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people 91 80 93 he estimated that these sects last from 1 666 to 3 000 years each time which as pointed out by leo strauss would mean that christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after machiavelli 91 81 93 machiavelli s concern with christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight 91 82 93 while fear of god can be replaced by fear of the prince if there is a strong enough prince machiavelli felt that having a religion is in any case especially essential to keeping a republic in order for machiavelli a truly great prince can never be conventionally religious himself but he should make his people religious if he can according to strauss 1958 pp 160 226 27 he was not the first person to ever explain religion in this way but his description of religion was novel because of the way he integrated this into his general account of princes machiavelli s judgment that governments need religion for practical political reasons was widespread among modern proponents of republics until approximately the time of the french revolution this therefore represents a point of disagreement between machiavelli and late modernity 91 83 93 positive side to factional and individual vice edit despite the classical precedents which machiavelli was not the only one to promote in his time machiavelli s realism and willingness to argue that good ends justify bad things is seen as a critical stimulus towards some of the most important theories of modern politics firstly particularly in the discourses on livy machiavelli is unusual in the positive side he sometimes seems to describe in factionalism in republics for example quite early in the discourses in book i chapter 4 a chapter title announces that the disunion of the plebs and senate in rome kept rome free that a community has different components whose interests must be balanced in any good regime is an idea with classical precedents but machiavelli s particularly extreme presentation is seen as a critical step towards the later political ideas of both a division of powers or checks and balances ideas which lay behind the us constitution as well as many other modern state constitutions similarly the modern economic argument for capitalism and most modern forms of economics was often stated in the form of public virtue from private vices also in this case even though there are classical precedents machiavelli s insistence on being both realistic and ambitious not only admitting that vice exists but being willing to risk encouraging it is a critical step on the path to this insight mansfield however argues that machiavelli s own aims have not been shared by those he influenced machiavelli argued against seeing mere peace and economic growth as worthy aims on their own if they would lead to what mansfield calls the taming of the prince 91 84 93 influence edit statue at the uffizi to quote robert bireley 91 85 93 there were in circulation approximately fifteen editions of the prince and nineteen of the discourses and french translations of each before they were placed on the index of paul iv in 1559 a measure which nearly stopped publication in catholic areas except in france three principal writers took the field against machiavelli between the publication of his works and their condemnation in 1559 and again by the tridentine index in 1564 these were the english cardinal reginald pole and the portuguese bishop jeronymo osorio both of whom lived for many years in italy and the italian humanist and later bishop ambrogio caterino politi machiavelli s ideas had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west helped by the new technology of the printing press during the first generations after machiavelli his main influence was in non republican governments pole reported that the prince was spoken of highly by thomas cromwell in england and had influenced henry viii in his turn towards protestantism and in his tactics for example during the pilgrimage of grace 91 86 93 a copy was also possessed by the catholic king and emperor charles v 91 87 93 in france after an initially mixed reaction machiavelli came to be associated with catherine de medici and the st bartholomew s day massacre as bireley 1990 17 reports in the 16th century catholic writers associated machiavelli with the protestants whereas protestant authors saw him as italian and catholic in fact he was apparently influencing both catholic and protestant kings 91 88 93 one of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of machiavelli especially the prince was that of the huguenot innocent gentillet whose work commonly referred to as discourse against machiavelli or anti machiavel was published in geneva in 1576 91 89 93 he accused machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that his works were the koran of the courtiers that he is of no reputation in the court of france which hath not machiavel s writings at the fingers ends 91 90 93 another theme of gentillet was more in the spirit of machiavelli himself he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies just as machiavelli had himself done despite also explaining how they could sometimes work this became the theme of much future political discourse in europe during the 17th century this includes the catholic counter reformation writers summarised by bireley giovanni botero justus lipsius carlo scribani adam contzen pedro de ribadeneira and diego de saavedra fajardo 91 91 93 these authors criticized machiavelli but also followed him in many ways they accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation and even a need for cunning and deceit but compared to machiavelli and like later modernist writers they emphasized economic progress much more than the riskier ventures of war these authors tended to cite tacitus as their source for realist political advice rather than machiavelli and this pretense came to be known as tacitism 91 92 93 black tacitism was in support of princely rule but red tacitism arguing the case for republics more in the original spirit of machiavelli himself became increasingly important francis bacon argued the case for what would become modern science which would be based more upon real experience and experimentation free from assumptions about metaphysics and aimed at increasing control of nature he named machiavelli as a predecessor modern materialist philosophy developed in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries starting in the generations after machiavelli this philosophy tended to be republican but as with the catholic authors machiavelli s realism and encouragement of using innovation to try to control one s own fortune were more accepted than his emphasis upon war and factional violence not only was innovative economics and politics a result but also modern science leading some commentators to say that the 18th century enlightenment involved a humanitarian moderating of machiavellianism 91 93 93 the importance of machiavelli s influence is notable in many important figures in this endeavor for example bodin 91 94 93 francis bacon 91 95 93 algernon sidney 91 96 93 harrington john milton 91 97 93 spinoza 91 98 93 rousseau hume 91 99 93 edward gibbon and adam smith although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration due to his controversy he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers such as montaigne 91 100 93 descartes 91 101 93 hobbes locke 91 102 93 and montesquieu 91 103 93 91 104 93 although jean jacques rousseau is associated with very different political ideas he was also influenced by him although he viewed machiavelli s work as a satirical piece in which machiavelli exposes the faults of a one man rule rather than exalting amorality in the seventeenth century it was in england that machiavelli s ideas were most substantially developed and adapted and that republicanism came once more to life and out of seventeenth century english republicanism there were to emerge in the next century not only a theme of english political and historical reflection of the writings of the bolingbroke circle and of gibbon and of early parliamentary radicals but a stimulus to the enlightenment in scotland on the continent and in america 91 105 93 john adams admired machiavelli s rational description of the realities of statecraft adams used machiavelli s works to argue for mixed government scholars have argued that machiavelli was a major indirect and direct influence upon the political thinking of the founding fathers of the united states due to his overwhelming favoritism of republicanism and the republican type of government according to john mccormick it is still very much debatable whether or not machiavelli was an advisor of tyranny or partisan of liberty 91 106 93 benjamin franklin james madison and thomas jefferson followed machiavelli s republicanism when they opposed what they saw as the emerging aristocracy that they feared alexander hamilton was creating with the federalist party 91 107 93 hamilton learned from machiavelli about the importance of foreign policy for domestic policy but may have broken from him regarding how rapacious a republic needed to be in order to survive 91 108 93 91 109 93 george washington was less influenced by machiavelli 91 110 93 the founding father who perhaps most studied and valued machiavelli as a political philosopher was john adams who profusely commented on the italian s thought in his work a defence of the constitutions of government of the united states of america 91 111 93 in this work john adams praised machiavelli with algernon sidney and montesquieu as a philosophic defender of mixed government for adams machiavelli restored empirical reason to politics while his analysis of factions was commendable adams likewise agreed with the florentine that human nature was immutable and driven by passions he also accepted machiavelli s belief that all societies were subject to cyclical periods of growth and decay for adams machiavelli lacked only a clear understanding of the institutions necessary for good government 91 111 93 20th century edit the 20th century italian communist antonio gramsci drew great inspiration from machiavelli s writings on ethics morals and how they relate to the state and revolution in his writings on passive revolution and how a society can be manipulated by controlling popular notions of morality 91 112 93 joseph stalin read the prince and annotated his own copy 91 113 93 in the 20th century there was also renewed interest in machiavelli s play la mandragola 1518 which received numerous stagings including several in new york at the new york shakespeare festival in 1976 and the riverside shakespeare company in 1979 as a musical comedy by peer raben in munich s antiteater in 1971 and at london s national theatre in 1984 91 114 93 machiavellian edit portrait of a gentleman cesare borgia used as an example of a successful ruler in the prince machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise the prince written in 1513 but not published until 1532 five years after his death although he privately circulated the prince among friends the only theoretical work to be printed in his lifetime was the art of war which was about military science since the 16th century generations of politicians remain attracted and repelled by its neutral acceptance and also positive encouragement of the amorality of powerful men described especially in the prince but also in his other works his works are sometimes even said to have contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words politics and politician 91 115 93 and it is sometimes thought that it is because of him that old nick became an english term for the devil 91 116 93 more obviously the adjective machiavellian became a term describing a form of politics that is marked by cunning duplicity or bad faith 91 117 93 machiavellianism also remains a popular term used casually in political discussions often as a byword for bare knuckled political realism 91 118 93 91 119 93 while machiavellianism is notable in the works of machiavelli scholars generally agree that his works are complex and have equally influential themes within them for example j g a pocock 1975 saw him as a major source of the republicanism that spread throughout england and north america in the 17th and 18th centuries and leo strauss 1958 whose view of machiavelli is quite different in many ways had similar remarks about machiavelli s influence on republicanism and argued that even though machiavelli was a teacher of evil he had a grandeur of vision that led him to advocate immoral actions whatever his intentions which are still debated today he has become associated with any proposal where the end justifies the means for example leo strauss 1987 p 160 297 wrote machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency which uses all means fair or foul iron or poison for achieving its ends its end being the aggrandizement of one s country or fatherland but also using the fatherland in the service of the self aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one s party in popular culture edit in english renaissance theatre elizabethan and jacobian the term machiavel from nicholas machiavel an anglicization of machiavelli s name based on french was used for a stock antagonist that resorted to ruthless means to preserve the power of the state and is now considered a synonym of machiavellian 91 120 93 91 121 93 christopher marlowe s play the jew of malta ca 1589 contains a prologue by a character called machiavel a senecan ghost based on machiavelli 91 122 93 machiavel

intrigues in cecelia holland s 1979 historical novel city of god 91 125 93 david maclaine writes that in the novel machiavelli is an off stage presence whose spirit permeates this work of intrigue and
