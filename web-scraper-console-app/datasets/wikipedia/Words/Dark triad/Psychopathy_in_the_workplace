psychopathy in the workplace from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search overview of psychopaths in the workplace the presence of psychopathy in the workplace although psychopaths typically represent a relatively small fraction of workplace staff can do enormous damage when in senior management roles 91 1 93 psychopaths are usually most common at higher levels of corporate organizations and their actions often cause a ripple effect throughout an organization setting the tone for an entire corporate culture examples of detrimental effects are increased bullying conflict stress staff turnover and absenteeism reduction in productivity and in social responsibility 91 2 93 ethical standards of entire organisations can be badly damaged if a corporate psychopath

tycoon robert maxwell to have been a strong candidate as a corporate psychopath 91 10 93 incidence edit hare reports that about 1 percent of the general population meets the clinical criteria for

positions in business 91 6 93 a 2011 study of australian white collar managers found that 5 76 percent could be classed as psychopathic and another 10 42 percent dysfunctional with psychopathic characteristics 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 better 160 source 160 needed 93 the organizational psychopath edit organizational psychopaths crave a god like feeling of power and control over other people they prefer to work at the very highest levels of their organizations allowing them to control the greatest number of people psychopaths who are political leaders managers and ceos fall into this category 91 5 93 organizational psychopaths generally appear to be intelligent sincere powerful charming witty and entertaining communicators they quickly assess what people want to hear and then create stories that fit those expectations they will con people into doing their work for them take credit for other people s work and even assign their work to junior staff members they have low patience when dealing with others display shallow emotions are unpredictable undependable and fail to take responsibility if something goes wrong that is their fault 91 5 93 according to a study from the university of notre dame published in the journal of business ethics psychopaths have a natural advantage in workplaces overrun by abusive supervision and are more likely to thrive under abusive bosses being more resistant to stress including interpersonal abuse and having less of a need for positive relationships than others 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 careers with highest proportion of psychopaths edit according to kevin dutton the ten careers with the highest proportion of psychopaths are 91 17 93 ceo lawyer media tv radio salesperson surgeon journalist police officer clergy chef civil servant workplace psychopaths may show a high number of the following behavior patterns the individual behaviors are not exclusive to the workplace psychopath though the higher the number of patterns exhibited the more likely they conform to the psychopath profile 91 18 93 public humiliation of others high propensity of having temper tantrums or ridiculing work performance malicious spreading of lies intentionally deceitful remorseless devoid of guilt frequently lie to push one s own point produce exaggerated bodily expressions yawning sneezing etc as a means of gaining attention rapidly shift between emotions used to manipulate people or cause high anxiety intentionally isolate persons from organizational resources quick to blame others for mistakes or for incomplete work even though they are guilty encourage co workers to torment alienate harass and or humiliate other peers take credit for others accomplishments steal and or sabotages other persons work refuse to take responsibility for misjudgements and or errors respond inappropriately to stimuli such as with a high pitched and forced laugh threaten any perceived enemy with discipline and or job loss in order to taint employee file set unrealistic and unachievable job expectations to set employees up for failure refuse or are reluctant to attend meetings with more than one person refuse to provide adequate training and or instructions to singled out victim invade personal privacy of others have multiple sexual encounters with other employees develop new ideas without real follow through very self centered and extremely egotistical often conversation revolves around them great deal of self importance often borrow money and or other material objects without any intentions of giving it back will do whatever it takes to close the deal no regard for ethics or legality how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power edit the authors of the book snakes in suits when psychopaths go to work describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath tries to climb and maintains power 91 6 93 entry psychopaths may use highly developed social skills and charm to obtain employment into an organization at this stage it could be difficult to spot anything indicative of psychopathic behaviour and as a new employee the psychopath might be perceives by people to be helpful and even benevolent assessment psychopaths categorize people according to personal usefulness and people could be recognized as either a pawn who has some informal influence and will be easily manipulated or a patron who has formal position and can be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks manipulation psychopaths try to create a scenario of psychopathic fiction where positive information about themselves and negative disinformation or gossip about others where people s role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons could be utilized and could be groomed into accepting the psychopath s agenda confrontation the psychopath can use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda and people will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron ascension the role of the subject as a patron in the psychopath s quest for power will be discarded and the psychopath will take for himself herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them why psychopaths are readily hired edit leading commentators on psychopathy have said that companies inadvertently attract employees who are psychopaths because of the wording of their job advertisements and their desire to engage people who are prepared to do whatever it takes to be successful in business 91 5 93 91 6 93 however in one case at least an advert explicitly asked for a sales executive with psychopathic tendencies 91 19 93 the advert title read psychopathic new business media sales executive superstar 50k 110k 91 20 93 corporate psychopaths are readily recruited into organizations because they make a distinctly positive impression at interviews 91 21 93 they appear to be alert friendly and easy to get along with and talk to 91 22 93 they look like they are of good ability emotionally well adjusted and reasonable and these traits make them attractive to those in charge of hiring staff within organizations unlike narcissists psychopaths are better able to create long lasting favorable first impressions though people may still eventually see through their facades 91 23 93 psychopaths undesirable personality traits may be easily misperceived by even skilled interviewers skilled interviewers can easily discern psychopathic qualities by including extremely skeptical high performing loyal employees throughout the entire interview of each interview while maintaining emotional balance for instance skilled interviewers can understand that sometimes irresponsibility may be misconstrued by employers as risk taking or entrepreneurial spirit and are encouraged to deeply query and understand if being employed is specific to building responsibility and a career or its the other their thrill seeking tendencies may be conveyed as high energy and enthusiasm for the job or work and skilled interviewers must strive to unravel the misconstrued to know and understand specific to the interviewees intentions their superficial charm may be misinterpreted by interviewers as charisma and yet obvious to skeptics and high performers 91 23 93 it is worth noting that psychopaths are not only accomplished liars they are also more likely to lie in interviews 91 24 93 for instance psychopaths may create fictitious work experiences or resumes and skeptical high performers can easily discern such fiction 91 23 93 they may also fabricate credentials such as diplomas certifications or awards and due diligence and skeptics and high performers easily discern such fabrications 91 23 93 thus in addition to seeming competent and likable in interviews psychopaths are also more likely to outright make up information during interviews than non psychopaths and thus the necessity of including extremely skeptical high performing loyal employees throughout the entire interview and review of each interview why psychopaths are readily promoted edit corporate psychopaths within organizations may be singled out for rapid promotion because of their polish charm and cool decisiveness and yet can also be singled out for rapid firing and removal 91 25 93 they are also helped by their manipulative and bullying skills 91 22 93 they create confusion around them divide and rule etc using instrumental bullying to promote their own agenda 91 26 93 psychopaths are able to maintain calm when others are reacting to normal stress and dangerous situations psychopaths are well versed in impression management and ingratiation both skills that can be used to impress people in positions of power and are also obvious indications of psychopathic traits easily discerned 91 27 93 bad consequences edit boddy identifies the following bad consequences of workplace psychopathy with additional cites in some cases 91 2 93 workplace bullying of employees 91 28 93 91 29 93 employees lose their jobs legal liabilities shareholders lose their investments wasted employee time suboptimal employee performance 91 30 93 91 31 93 increased workload difficult working conditions poor levels of job satisfaction lower perceived levels of corporate social responsibility raised staff turnover absenteeism heightened level of workplace conflict arguments yelling rudeness divide and conquer counterproductive work behavior 91 31 93 91 32 93 counterproductive work behavior edit main article counterproductive work behavior boddy suggests that because of abusive supervision by corporate psychopaths large amounts of anti company feeling will be generated among the employees of the organisations that corporate psychopaths work in this should result in high levels of counterproductive behaviour as employees give vent to their anger with the corporation which they perceive to be acting through its corporate psychopathic managers in a way that is eminently unfair to them 91 2 93 according to a 2017 uk study a high ranking corporate psychopath could trigger lower ranked staff to become workplace bullies as a manifestation of counterproductive work behavior 91 33 93 corporate psychopath theory of the global financial crisis edit main article financial crisis of 2007 08 boddy makes the case that corporate psychopaths were instrumental in causing the 2007 08 global financial crisis 91 25 93 he claims that the same corporate psychopaths who probably caused the crisis by greed and avarice are now advising government on how to get out of the crisis 91 2 93 psychologist oliver james has described the credit crunch as a mass outbreak of corporate psychopathy which resulted in something that very nearly crashed the whole world economy 91 34 93 for example during this financial crisis the behaviour of some key people at the top of the world s largest banks came under scrutiny at the time of its collapse in 2008 the royal bank of scotland was the world s fifth largest bank by market capitalisation ceo fred the shred goodwin was known for taking excessive risks and showing little concern for his mismanagement which led to the bank s collapse goodwin s demeanour toward colleagues was unpredictable and he is said to have lived a luxury lifestyle while fostering a culture of fear 91 35 93 renowned psychotherapist professor manfred f r kets de vries singled out goodwin and former barclays ceo bob diamond as exhibiting psychopathic behaviours in his working paper on the sob seductive operational bully or psychopath lite 91 36 93 screening edit from an organizational perspective organizations can insulate themselves from the organizational psychopath by taking the following steps when recruiting 91 18 93 conduct behavioral type interview verify information contained in the curriculum vitae conduct reference checks obtain work samples carry out criminal reference checks the following tests could be used to screen psychopaths psychopathy checklist screening version pcl sv 91 37 93 psychopathy measure management research version pm mrv 91 2 93 business scan b scan test 91 38 93 91 39 93 there have been anecdotal reports that at least one uk bank was using a psychopathy measure to actively recruit psychopaths 91 40 93 91 41 93 research findings based on the pm mrv may have little relevance to medical psychopathy 91 42 93 workplace bullying overlap edit main article workplace bullying narcissism lack of self regulation lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies these traits are shared with psychopaths indicating that there is some theoretical cross over between bullies and psychopaths 91 29 93 bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates 91 5 93 bullying is also used as a tactic to scare confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath 91 5 93 using meta data analysis on hundreds of uk research papers boddy concluded that 36 of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths according to boddy there are two types of bullying 91 2 93 predatory bullying the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting vulnerable people for the sake of it instrumental bullying the bullying is for a purpose helping the bully achieve his or her goals a corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further his goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and divide and rule people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying crime and drug use than other people 91 28 93 hare and babiak noted that about 29 per cent of corporate psychopaths are also bullies 91 6 93 other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace 91 28 93 a workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning these types of people often have psychopathic traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process these individuals often lack anger management skills and have a distorted sense of reality consequently when confronted with the accusation of abuse the abuser is not aware that any harm was done 91 43 93 team ethics and values prevent detect and correct bullying and mobbing in the workplace in fiction edit patrick bateman in the 1991 novel american psycho and its
