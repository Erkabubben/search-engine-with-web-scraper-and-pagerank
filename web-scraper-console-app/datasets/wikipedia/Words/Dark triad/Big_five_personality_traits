the 1980s onward in psychological trait theory starting in the 1990s the theory identified five factors by labels for the us english speaking population typically referred to as openness to experience inventive curious vs consistent cautious conscientiousness efficient organized vs extravagant careless extraversion outgoing energetic vs solitary reserved agreeableness friendly compassionate vs critical rational neuroticism sensitive nervous vs resilient confident 91 2 93 when factor analysis a statistical technique is applied to personality survey data it reveals semantic associations some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person for example someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as always prepared rather than messy these associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality temperament and psyche 91 3 93 91 4 93 those labels for the five factors may be remembered using the acronyms ocean or canoe beneath each proposed global factor there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors for example extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness assertiveness excitement seeking warmth activity and positive emotions 91 5 93 these traits are not black and white but rather placed on continua 91 6 93 contents 1 development

to comprehend the relationship between personality and academic behaviors 91 7 93 this model was defined by several independent sets of researchers who used factor analysis of verbal descriptors of human behavior 91 8 93 these researchers began by studying relationships between a large number of verbal descriptors related to personality traits they reduced the lists of these descriptors by 5 10 fold and then used factor analysis to group the remaining traits using data mostly based upon people s estimations in self report questionnaire and peer ratings in order to find the underlying factors of personality 91 9 93 91 10 93 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 the initial model was advanced by ernest tupes and raymond christal in 1961 91 12 93 but failed to reach an academic audience until the 1980s in 1990 j m digman advanced his five factor model of personality which lewis goldberg extended to the highest level of organization 91 14 93 these five overarching domains have been found to contain and subsume most known personality traits and are assumed to represent the basic structure behind all personality traits 91 15 93 at least four sets of researchers have worked independently within lexical hypothesis in personality theory for decades on this problem and have identified generally the same five factors tupes and christal were first followed by goldberg at the oregon research institute 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 cattell at the university of illinois 91 11 93 91 21 93 91 22 93 91 23 93 and costa and mccrae 91 24 93 91 25 93 91 26 93 91 27 93 these four sets of researchers used somewhat different methods in finding the five traits and thus each set of five factors has somewhat different names and definitions however all have been found to be highly inter correlated and factor analytically aligned 91 28 93 91 29 93 91 30 93 91 31 93 91 32 93 studies indicate that the big five traits are not nearly as powerful in predicting and explaining actual behavior as are the more numerous facets or primary traits 91 33 93 91 34 93 each of the big five personality traits contains two separate but correlated aspects reflecting a level of personality below the broad domains but above the many facet scales that are also part of the big five 91 35 93 the aspects are labeled as follows volatility and withdrawal for neuroticism enthusiasm and assertiveness for extraversion intellect and openness for openness to experience industriousness and orderliness for conscientiousness and compassion and politeness for agreeableness 91 35 93 people who do not exhibit a clear predisposition to a single factor in each dimension above are considered adaptable moderate and reasonable yet they can also be perceived as unprincipled inscrutable and calculating 91 36 93 descriptions of the particular personality traits edit openness to experience edit openness to experience is a general appreciation for art emotion adventure unusual ideas imagination curiosity and variety of experience people who are open to experience are intellectually curious open to emotion sensitive to beauty and willing to try new things they tend to be when compared to closed people more creative and more aware of their feelings they are also more likely to hold unconventional beliefs high openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus and more likely to engage in risky behavior or drug taking 91 37 93 moreover individuals with high openness are said to pursue self actualization specifically by seeking out intense euphoric experiences conversely those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data driven 160 8211 32 sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed minded some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor as there is a lack of biological support for this particular trait openness has not shown a significant association with any brain regions as opposed to the other four traits which did when using brain imaging to detect changes in volume associated with each trait 91 38 93 sample items edit i have a rich vocabulary i have a vivid imagination i have excellent ideas i am quick to understand things i use difficult words i spend time reflecting on things i am full of ideas i have difficulty understanding abstract ideas reversed i am not interested in abstract ideas reversed i do not have a good imagination reversed 91 39 93 conscientiousness edit conscientiousness is a tendency to display self discipline act dutifully and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations it is related to the way in which people control regulate and direct their impulses high conscientiousness is often perceived as being stubborn and focused low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability 91 36 93 high scores on conscientiousness indicate a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior 91 40 93 the average level of conscientiousness rises among young adults and then declines among older adults 91 41 93 sample items edit i am always prepared i pay attention to details i get chores done right away i like order i follow a schedule i am exacting in my work i leave my belongings around reversed i make a mess of things reversed i often forget to put things back in their proper place reversed i shirk my duties reversed 91 39 93 extraversion edit extraversion is characterized by breadth of activities as opposed to depth surgency from external activity situations and energy creation from external means 91 42 93 the trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world extraverts enjoy interacting with people and are often perceived as full of energy they tend to be enthusiastic action oriented individuals they possess high group visibility like to talk and assert themselves extraverted people may appear more dominant in social settings as opposed to introverted people in this setting 91 43 93 introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extraverts they tend to seem quiet low key deliberate and less involved in the social world their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression instead they are more independent of their social world than extraverts introverts need less stimulation and more time alone than extraverts this does not mean that they are unfriendly or antisocial rather they are reserved in social situations 91 1 93 generally people are a combination of extraversion and introversion with personality psychologist hans eysenck suggesting a model by which individual neurological differences produce these traits 91 43 93 58 8202 106 8202 sample items edit i am the life of the party i feel comfortable around people i start conversations i talk to a lot of different people at parties i do not mind being the center of attention i do not talk a lot reversed i keep in the background reversed i have little to say reversed i do not like to draw attention to myself reversed i am quiet around strangers reversed 91 39 93 agreeableness edit the agreeableness trait reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony agreeable individuals value getting along with others they are generally considerate kind generous trusting and trustworthy helpful and willing to compromise their interests with others 91 1 93 agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature disagreeable individuals place self interest above getting along with others they are generally unconcerned with others well being and are less likely to extend themselves for other people sometimes their skepticism about others motives causes them to be suspicious unfriendly and uncooperative 91 44 93 low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy 91 36 93 because agreeableness is a social trait research has shown that one s agreeableness positively correlates with the quality of relationships with one s team members agreeableness also positively predicts transformational leadership skills in a study conducted among 169 participants in leadership positions in a variety of professions individuals were asked to take a personality test and have two evaluations completed by directly supervised subordinates leaders with high levels of agreeableness were more likely to be considered transformational rather than transactional although the relationship was not strong r 0 32 946 0 28 p lt 0 01 it was the strongest of the big five traits however the same study showed no predictive power of leadership effectiveness as evaluated by the leader s direct supervisor 91 45 93 conversely agreeableness has been found to be negatively related to transactional leadership in the military a study of asian military units showed leaders with a high level of agreeableness to be more likely to receive a low rating for transformational leadership skills 91 46 93 therefore with further research organizations may be able to determine an individual s potential for performance based on their personality traits for instance 91 47 93 in their journal article which personality attributes are most important in the workplace paul sackett and philip walmsley claim that conscientiousness and agreeableness are important to success across many different jobs sample items edit i am interested in people i sympathize with others feelings i have a soft heart i take time out for others i feel others emotions i make people feel at ease i am not really interested in others reversed i insult people reversed i am not interested in other people s problems reversed i feel little concern for others reversed 91 39 93 neuroticism edit neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anger anxiety or depression 91 48 93 it is sometimes called emotional instability or is reversed and referred to as emotional stability according to hans eysenck s 1967 theory of personality neuroticism is interlinked with low tolerance for stress or aversive stimuli 91 49 93 neuroticism is a classic temperament trait that has been studied in temperament research for decades before it was adapted by the five factors model 91 50 93 those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress they are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening they can perceive minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult they also tend to be flippant in the way they express emotions their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time which means they are often in a bad mood for instance neuroticism is connected to a pessimistic approach toward work to certainty that work impedes personal relationships and to higher levels of anxiety from the pressures at work 91 51 93 furthermore those who score high on neuroticism may display more skin conductance reactivity than those who score low on neuroticism 91 49 93 91 52 93 these problems in emotional regulation can diminish the ability of a person scoring high on neuroticism to think clearly make decisions and cope effectively with stress lacking contentment in one s life achievements can correlate with high neuroticism scores and increase one s likelihood of falling into clinical depression moreover individuals high in neuroticism tend to experience more negative life events 91 48 93 91 53 93 but neuroticism also changes in response to positive and negative life experiences 91 48 93 91 53 93 also individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to have worse psychological well being 91 54 93 at the other end of the scale individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive they tend to be calm emotionally stable and free from persistent negative feelings freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings 91 55 93 neuroticism is similar but not identical to being neurotic in the freudian sense i e neurosis some psychologists 91 who 93 prefer to call neuroticism by the term emotional instability to differentiate it from the term neurotic in a career test sample items edit i get stressed out easily i worry about things i am easily disturbed i get upset easily i change my mood a lot i have frequent mood swings i get irritated easily i often feel blue i am relaxed most of the time reversed i seldom feel blue reversed 91 39 93 history edit early trait research edit historically preceding the big five personality traits b5 or the five factors model ffm was hippocrates s four types of temperament sanguine phlegmatic choleric and melancholic the sanguine type is most closely related to emotional stability and extraversion the phlegmatic type is also stable but introverted the choleric type is unstable and extraverted and the melancholic type is unstable and introverted 91 56 93 in 1884 sir francis galton was the first person who is known to have investigated the hypothesis that it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human personality traits by sampling language the lexical hypothesis 91 9 93 in 1936 gordon allport and s odbert put sir francis galton s hypothesis into practice by extracting 4 504 adjectives which they believed were descriptive of observable and relatively permanent traits from the dictionaries at that time 91 57 93 in 1940 raymond cattell retained the adjectives and eliminated synonyms to reduce the total to 171 91 11 93 he constructed a self report instrument for the clusters of personality traits he found from the adjectives which he called the sixteen personality factor questionnaire in 1949 the first systematic multivariate research of personality was conducted by joy p guilford guilford analyzed ten factors of personality which he measured by the guilford zimmerman temperament survey these scales included general activity energy vs inactivity restraint seriousness vs impulsiveness ascendance social boldness vs submissiveness sociability social interest vs shyness emotional stability evenness vs fluctuation of mood objectivity thick skinned vs hypersensitive friendliness agreeableness vs belligerence thoughtfulness reflective vs disconnected personal relations tolerance vs hypercritical masculinity hard boiled vs sympathetic 91 56 93 these overlapping scales were later further analyzed by guilford et al and condensed into three dimensions social activity general activity ascendence sociability introversion extraversion restraint thoughtfulness and emotional health emotional stability objectivity friendliness personal relations 91 56 93 based on a subset of only 20 of the 36 dimensions that cattell had originally discovered ernest tupes and raymond christal 1961 claimed to have found just five broad factors which they labeled surgency agreeableness dependability emotional stability and culture 91 12 93 warren norman subsequently relabeled dependability as conscientiousness 91 13 93 hiatus in research edit during the late 1960s to 1970s the changing zeitgeist made publication of personality research difficult in his 1968 book personality and assessment walter mischel asserted that personality instruments could not predict behavior with a correlation of more than 0 3 social psychologists like mischel argued that attitudes and behavior were not stable but varied with the situation predicting behavior from personality instruments was claimed to be impossible 91 by whom 93 renewed attention edit the paradigm shift back to acceptance of the five factor model came in the early 1980s in a 1980 symposium in honolulu four prominent researchers lewis goldberg naomi takemoto chock andrew comrey and john m digman reviewed the available personality instruments of the day 91 58 93 this event was followed by widespread acceptance of the five factor model among personality researchers during the 1980s by 1983 experiments had demonstrated that the predictions of personality models correlated better with real life behavior under stressful emotional conditions as opposed to typical survey administration under neutral emotional conditions 91 59 93 peter saville and his team included the five factor pentagon model with the original occupational personality questionnaires opq in 1984 the pentagon model was closely followed by the neo pi r neo five factor personality inventory published by costa and mccrae in 1985 however the methodology employed in constructing the neo instrument has been subject to critical scrutiny see section below 91 60 93 58 8202 431 33 8202 emerging methodologies increasingly confirmed personality theories during the 1980s though generally failing to predict single instances of behavior researchers found that they could predict patterns of behavior by aggregating large numbers of observations 91 61 93 as a result correlations between personality and behavior increased substantially and it was clear that personality did in fact exist 91 62 93 personality and social psychologists now generally agree that both personal and situational variables are needed to account for human behavior 91 63 93 trait theories amassed favorable evidence and there was a resurgence of interest in this area 91 64 93 in the 1980s lewis goldberg started his own lexical project again emphasizing five broad factors 91 65 93 which he later labeled the big five in 2007 colin g deyoung lena c quilty and jordan b peterson concluded that the 10 aspects of the big five may have distinct biological substrates 91 66 93 this was derived through factor analyses of two data samples with the international personality item pool l r goldberg 1999 91 67 93 followed by cross correlation with scores derived from 10 genetic factors identified as underlying the shared variance among the revised neo personality inventory facets k l jang et al 2002 91 68 93 colin g deyoung et al 2016 researched the big five model and how the five broad factors are compatible with the 25 scales of the personality inventory pid 5 for the dsm 5 deyoung et al considers the pid 5 to measure facet level traits 91 69 93 because the big five factors are broader than the 25 scales of the pid 5 there is disagreement in personality psychology relating to the number of factors within the big five according to deyoung et al 2016 the number of valid facets might be limited only by the number of traits that can be shown to have discriminant validity 91 69 93 the ffm associated test was used by cambridge analytica and was part of the psychographic profiling 91 70 93 controversy during the 2016 us presidential election 91 71 93 91 72 93 biological and developmental factors edit there of course are factors that influence a personality and these are called the determinants of personality these factors determine the traits which a person develops in the course of development from a child temperament vis vis personality edit there are debates between researchers of temperament and researchers of personality as to whether or not biologically based differences define a concept of temperament or a part of personality the presence of such differences in pre cultural individuals such as animals or young infants suggests that they belong to temperament since personality is a socio cultural concept for this reason developmental psychologists generally interpret individual differences in children as an expression of temperament rather than personality 91 73 93 some researchers argue that temperaments and personality traits are age specific manifestations of virtually the same latent qualities 91 74 93 91 75 93 some believe that early childhood temperaments may become adolescent and adult personality traits as individuals basic genetic characteristics actively reactively and passively interact with their changing environments 91 73 93 91 74 93 91 76 93 91 clarification needed 93 researchers of adult temperament point out that similarly to sex age and mental illness temperament is based on biochemical systems whereas personality is a product of socialization of an individual possessing these four types of features temperament interacts with social cultural factors but still cannot be controlled or easily changed by these factors 91 77 93 91 78 93 91 79 93 91 80 93 therefore it is suggested that temperament should be kept as an independent concept for further studies and not be conflated with personality 91 81 93 moreover temperament refers to dynamical features of behavior energetic tempo sensitivity and emotionality related whereas personality is to be considered a psycho social construct comprising the content characteristics of human behavior such as values attitudes habits preferences personal history self image 91 78 93 91 79 93 91 80 93 temperament researchers point out that the lack of attention to extant temperament research by the developers of the big five model lead to an overlap between its dimensions and dimensions described in multiple temperament models much earlier for example neuroticism reflects the traditional temperament dimension of emotionality extraversion the temperament dimension of energy or activity and openness to experience the temperament dimension of sensation seeking 91 80 93 91 82 93 heritability edit personality research often uses twin studies to determine how much heritable and environmental factors contribute to the big five personality traits a 1996 behavioural genetics study of twins suggested that heritability and environmental factors both influence all five factors to the same degree 91 83 93 among four twin studies examined in 2003 the mean percentage for heritability was calculated for each personality and it was concluded that heritability influenced the five factors broadly the self report measures were as follows openness to experience was estimated to have a 57 genetic influence extraversion 54 conscientiousness 49 neuroticism 48 and agreeableness 42 91 84 93 non humans edit the big 5 personality traits can be seen in chimpanzees the big five personality traits have been assessed in some non human species but methodology is debatable in one series of studies human ratings of chimpanzees using the hominoid personality questionnaire revealed factors of extraversion conscientiousness and agreeableness 160 as well as an additional factor of dominance 160 across hundreds of chimpanzees in zoological parks a large naturalistic sanctuary and a research laboratory neuroticism and openness factors were found in an original zoo sample but were not replicated in a new zoo sample or in other settings perhaps reflecting the design of the cpq 91 85 93 a study review found that markers for the three dimensions extraversion neuroticism and agreeableness were found most consistently across different species followed by openness only chimpanzees showed markers for conscientious behavior 91 86 93 a study completed in 2020 concluded that dolphins have some similar personality traits to humans both are large brained intelligent animals but have evolved separately for millions of years 91 87 93 development during childhood and adolescence edit research on the big five and personality in general has focused primarily on individual differences in adulthood rather than in childhood and adolescence and often include temperament traits 91 73 93 91 74 93 91 76 93 recently there has been growing recognition of the need to study child and adolescent personality trait development in order to understand how traits develop and change throughout the lifespan 91 88 93 recent studies have begun to explore the developmental origins and trajectories of the big five among children and adolescents especially those that relate to temperament 91 73 93 91 74 93 91 76 93 many researchers have sought to distinguish between personality and temperament 91 89 93 temperament often refers to early behavioral and affective characteristics that are thought to be driven primarily by genes 91 89 93 models of temperament often include four trait dimensions surgency sociability negative emotionality persistence effortful control and activity level 91 89 93 some of these differences in temperament are evident at if not before birth 91 73 93 91 74 93 for example both parents and researchers recognize that some newborn infants are peaceful and easily soothed while others are comparatively fussy and hard to calm 91 74 93 unlike temperament however many researchers view the development of personality as gradually occurring throughout childhood 91 89 93 contrary to some researchers who question whether children have stable personality traits big five or otherwise 91 90 93 most researchers contend that there are significant psychological differences between children that are associated with relatively stable distinct and salient behavior patterns 91 73 93 91 74 93 91 76 93 the structure manifestations and development of the big five in childhood and adolescence have been studied using a variety of methods including parent and teacher ratings 91 91 93 91 92 93 91 93 93 preadolescent and adolescent self and peer ratings 91 94 93 91 95 93 91 96 93 and observations of parent child interactions 91 76 93 results from these studies support the relative stability of personality traits across the human lifespan at least from preschool age through adulthood 91 74 93 91 76 93 91 97 93 91 98 93 more specifically research suggests that four of the big five namely extraversion neuroticism conscientiousness and agreeableness reliably describe personality differences in childhood adolescence and adulthood 91 74 93 91 76 93 91 97 93 91 98 93 however some evidence suggests that openness may not be a fundamental stable part of childhood personality although some researchers have found that openness in children and adolescents relates to attributes such as creativity curiosity imagination and intellect 91 99 93 many researchers have failed to find distinct individual differences in openness in childhood and early adolescence 91 74 93 91 76 93 potentially openness may a manifest in unique currently unknown ways in childhood or b may only manifest as children develop socially and cognitively 91 74 93 91 76 93 other studies have found evidence for all of the big five traits in childhood and adolescence as well as two other child specific traits irritability and activity 91 100 93 despite these specific differences the majority of findings suggest that personality traits particularly extraversion neuroticism conscientiousness and agreeableness are evident in childhood and adolescence and are associated with distinct social emotional patterns of behavior that are largely consistent with adult manifestations of those same personality traits 91 74 93 91 76 93 91 97 93 91 98 93 some researchers have proposed the youth personality trait is best described by six trait dimensions neuroticism extraversion openness to experience agreeableness conscientiousness and activity 91 101 93 despite some preliminary evidence for this little six model 91 89 93 91 101 93 research in this area has been delayed by a lack of available measures previous research has found evidence that most adults become more agreeable conscientious and less neurotic as they age 91 102 93 this has been referred to as the maturation effect 91 75 93 many researchers have sought to investigate how trends in adult personality development compare to trends in youth personality development 91 101 93 two main population level indices have been important in this area of research rank order consistency and mean level consistency rank order consistency indicates the relative placement of individuals within a group 91 103 93 mean level consistency indicates whether groups increase or decrease on certain traits throughout the lifetime 91 102 93 findings from these studies indicate that consistent with adult personality trends youth personality becomes increasingly more stable in terms of rank order throughout childhood 91 101 93 unlike adult personality research which indicates that people become agreeable conscientious and emotionally stable with age 91 102 93 some findings in youth personality research have indicated that mean levels of agreeableness conscientiousness and openness to experience decline from late childhood to late adolescence 91 101 93 the disruption hypothesis which proposes that biological social and psychological changes experienced during youth result in temporary dips in maturity has been proposed to explain these findings 91 89 93 91 101 93 extraversion positive emotionality edit in big five studies extraversion has been associated with surgency 91 73 93 children with high extraversion are energetic talkative social and dominant with children and adults whereas children with low extraversion tend to be quiet calm inhibited and submissive to other children and adults 91 74 93 individual differences in extraversion first manifest in infancy as varying levels of positive emotionality 91 104 93 these differences in turn predict social and physical activity during later childhood and may represent or be associated with the behavioral activation system 91 73 93 91 74 93 in children extraversion positive emotionality includes four sub traits three traits that are similar to the previously described traits of temperament activity sociability shyness 91 105 93 91 50 93 and the trait of dominance activity similarly to findings in temperament research children with high activity tend to have high energy levels and more intense and frequent motor activity compared to their peers 91 74 93 91 91 93 91 106 93 salient differences in activity reliably manifest in infancy persist through adolescence and fade as motor activity decreases in adulthood 91 107 93 or potentially develops into talkativeness 91 74 93 91 108 93 dominance children with high dominance tend to influence the behavior of others particularly their peers to obtain desirable rewards or outcomes 91 74 93 91 109 93 91 110 93 such children are generally skilled at organizing activities and games 91 111 93 and deceiving others by controlling their nonverbal behavior 91 112 93 shyness children with high shyness are generally socially withdrawn nervous and inhibited around strangers 91 74 93 in time such children may become fearful even around known others especially if their peers reject them 91 74 93 91 113 93 similar pattern was described in temperament longitudinal studies of shyness 91 50 93 sociability children with high sociability generally prefer to be with others rather than alone 91 74 93 91 114 93 during middle childhood the distinction between low sociability and high shyness becomes more pronounced particularly as children gain greater control over how and where they spend their time 91 74 93 91 115 93 91 116 93 development throughout adulthood edit many studies of longitudinal data which correlate people s test scores over time and cross sectional data which compare personality levels across different age groups show a high degree of stability in personality traits during adulthood especially neuroticism trait that is often regarded as a temperament trait 91 117 93 similarly to longitudinal research in temperament for the same traits 91 50 93 it is shown that the personality stabilizes for working age individuals within about four years after starting working there is also little evidence that adverse life events can have any significant impact on the personality of individuals 91 118 93 more recent research and meta analyses of previous studies however indicate that change occurs in all five traits at various points in the lifespan the new research shows evidence for a maturation effect on average levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness typically increase with time whereas extraversion neuroticism and openness tend to decrease 91 119 93 research has also demonstrated that changes in big five personality traits depend on the individual s current stage of development for example levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness demonstrate a negative trend during childhood and early adolescence before trending upwards during late adolescence and into adulthood 91 88 93 in addition to these group effects there are individual differences different people demonstrate unique patterns of change at all stages of life 91 120 93 in addition some research fleeson 2001 suggests that the big five should not be conceived of as dichotomies such as extraversion vs introversion but as continua each individual has the capacity to move along each dimension as circumstances social or temporal change he is or she is therefore not simply on one end of each trait dichotomy but is a blend of both exhibiting some characteristics more often than others 91 121 93 research regarding personality with growing age has suggested that as individuals enter their elder years 79 86 those with lower iq see a raise in extraversion but a decline in conscientiousness and physical well being 91 122 93 group differences edit gender differences edit some cross cultural research has shown some patterns of gender differences on responses to the neo pi r and the big five inventory 91 123 93 91 124 93 for example women consistently report higher neuroticism agreeableness warmth an extraversion facet and openness to feelings and men often report higher assertiveness a facet of extraversion and openness to ideas as assessed by the neo pi r 91 125 93 a study of gender differences in 55 nations using the big five inventory found that women tended to be somewhat higher than men in neuroticism extraversion agreeableness and conscientiousness the difference in neuroticism was the most prominent and consistent with significant differences found in 49 of the 55 nations surveyed 91 126 93 gender differences in personality traits are largest in prosperous healthy and more gender egalitarian nations the explanation for this given by the researchers of a 2001 paper is that acts by women in individualistic egalitarian countries are more likely to be attributed to their personality rather than being attributed to ascribed gender roles within collectivist traditional countries 91 125 93 measured differences in the magnitude of sex differences between more or less developed world regions were caused by the changes in the measured personalities of men not women in these respective regions that is men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic less extraverted less conscientious and less agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions women on the other hand tended not to differ in personality traits across regions 91 126 93 the authors of this 2008 study speculated that resource poor environments that is countries with low levels of development may inhibit the development of gender differences whereas resource rich environments facilitate them this may be because males require more resources than females in order to reach their full personality potential of less conscientious less agreeable less neurotic and less extraverted the authors also speculated in their discussion that due to different evolutionary pressures men may have evolved to be more risk taking and socially dominant whereas women evolved to be more cautious and nurturing the authors further posited that ancient hunter gatherer societies may have been more egalitarian than later agriculturally oriented societies hence the development of gender inequalities may have acted to constrain the development of gender differences in personality that originally evolved in hunter gatherer societies as modern societies have become more egalitarian again it may be that innate sex differences are no longer constrained and hence manifest more fully than in less wealthy cultures 91 126 93 this is one interpretation of the results among other possible interpretations birth order differences edit main article birth order frank sulloway argues that firstborns are more conscientious more socially dominant less agreeable and less open to new ideas compared to siblings that were born later large scale studies using random samples and self report personality tests however have found milder effects than sulloway claimed or no significant effects of birth order on personality 91 127 93 91 128 93 a study using the project talent data which is a large scale representative survey of american high school students with 272 003 eligible participants found statistically significant but very small effects the average absolute correlation between birth order and personality was 02 of birth order on personality such that firstborns were slightly more conscientious dominant and agreeable while also being less neurotic and less sociable 91 129 93 parental socioeconomic status and participant gender had much larger correlations with personality in 2002 the journal of psychology posted a big five personality trait difference where researchers explored the relationship between the five factor model and the universal diverse orientation udo in counselor trainees thompson r brossart d and mivielle a 2002 udo is known as one social attitude that produces a strong awareness and or acceptance towards the similarities and differences among individuals miville m romas j johnson j and lon r 2002 the study found that the counselor trainees that are more open to the idea of creative expression a facet of openness to experience openness to aesthetics among individuals are more likely to work with a diverse group of clients and feel comfortable in their role 91 130 93 cultural differences edit main article big five personality traits and culture the big five have been pursued in a variety of languages and cultures such as german 91 131 93 chinese 91 132 93 and indian 91 133 93 91 134 93 for example thompson has claimed to find the big five structure across several cultures using an international english language scale 91 135 93 cheung van de vijver and leong 2011 suggest however that the openness factor is particularly unsupported in asian countries and that a different fifth factor is identified 91 136 93 recent work has found relationships between geert hofstede s cultural factors individualism power distance masculinity and uncertainty avoidance with the average big five scores in a country 91 137 93 for instance the degree to which a country values individualism correlates with its average extraversion whereas people living in cultures which are accepting of large inequalities in their power structures tend to score somewhat higher on conscientiousness 91 138 93 91 139 93 personality differences around the world might even have contributed to the emergence of different political systems a recent study has found that countries average personality trait levels are correlated with their political systems countries with higher average trait openness tended to have more democratic institutions an association that held even after factoring out other relevant influences such as economic development 91 140 93 attempts to replicate the big five in other countries with local dictionaries have succeeded in some countries but not in others apparently for instance hungarians do not appear to have a single agreeableness factor 91 141 93 other researchers have found evidence for agreeableness but not for other factors 91 142 93 it is important to recognize that individual differences in traits are relevant in a specific cultural context and that the traits do not have their effects outside of that context 91 43 93 58 8202 189 8202 health edit personality change from disease edit some diseases cause changes in personality for example although gradual memory impairment is the hallmark feature of alzheimer s disease a systematic review of personality changes in alzheimer s disease by robins wahlin and byrne published in 2011 found systematic and consistent trait changes mapped to the big five the largest change observed was a decrease in conscientiousness the next most significant changes were an increase in neuroticism and decrease in extraversion but openness and agreeableness were also decreased these changes in personality could assist with early diagnosis 91 143 93 personality disorders edit main article personality disorders as of 2002 91 update 93 there were over fifty published studies relating the ffm to personality disorders 91 144 93 since that time quite a number of additional studies have expanded on this research base and provided further empirical support for understanding the dsm personality disorders in terms of the ffm domains 91 145 93 in her review of the personality disorder literature published in 2007 lee anna clark asserted that the five factor model of personality is widely accepted as representing the higher order structure of both normal and abnormal personality traits 91 146 93 however other researchers disagree that this model is widely accepted see the section critique below and suggest that it simply replicates early temperament research 91 80 93 91 147 93 noticeably ffm publications never compare their findings to temperament models even though temperament and mental disorders especially personality disorders are thought to be based on the same neurotransmitter imbalances just to varying degrees 91 80 93 91 148 93 91 149 93 91 150 93 the five factor model was claimed to significantly predict all ten personality disorder symptoms and outperform the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi in the prediction of borderline avoidant and dependent personality disorder symptoms 91 151 93 however most predictions related to an increase in neuroticism and a decrease in agreeableness and therefore did not differentiate between the disorders very well 91 152 93 common mental disorders edit average deviation of five factor personality profile of heroin users from the population mean 91 153 93 n stands for neuroticism e for extraversion o for openness to experience a for agreeableness and c for conscientiousness converging evidence from several nationally representative studies has established three classes of mental disorders which are especially common in the general population depressive disorders e g major depressive disorder mdd dysthymic disorder 91 154 93 anxiety disorders e g generalized anxiety disorder gad post traumatic stress disorder ptsd panic disorder agoraphobia specific phobia and social phobia 91 154 93 and substance use disorders suds 91 155 93 91 156 93 the five factor personality profiles of users of different drugs may be different 91 157 93 for example the typical profile for heroin users is n x21d1 o x21d1 a x21d3 c x21d3 displaystyle rm n uparrow rm o uparrow rm a downarrow rm c downarrow whereas for ecstasy users the high level of n is not expected but e is higher e x21d1 o x21d1 a x21d3 c x21d3 displaystyle rm e uparrow rm o uparrow rm a downarrow rm c downarrow 91 157 93 these common mental disorders cmds have been empirically linked to the big five personality traits neuroticism in particular numerous studies have found that having high scores of neuroticism significantly increases one s risk for developing a common mental disorder 91 158 93 91 159 93 a large scale meta analysis n gt 75 000 examining the relationship between all of the big five personality traits and common mental disorders found that low conscientiousness yielded consistently strong effects for each common mental disorder examined i e mdd dysthymic disorder gad ptsd panic disorder agoraphobia social phobia specific phobia and sud 91 160 93 this finding parallels research on physical health which has established that conscientiousness is the strongest personality predictor of reduced mortality and is highly negatively correlated with making poor health choices 91 161 93 91 162 93 in regards to the other personality domains the meta analysis found that all common mental disorders examined were defined by high neuroticism most exhibited low extraversion only sud was linked to agreeableness negatively and no disorders were associated with openness 91 160 93 a meta analysis of 59 longitudinal studies showed that high neuroticism predicted the development of anxiety depression substance abuse psychosis schizophrenia and non specific mental distress also after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history 91 163 93 the personality psychopathology models edit five major models have been posed to explain the nature of the relationship between personality and mental illness there is currently no single best model as each of them has received at least some empirical support it is also important to note that these models are not mutually exclusive more than one may be operating for a particular individual and various mental disorders may be explained by different models 91 163 93 91 164 93 the vulnerability risk model according to this model personality contributes to the onset or etiology of various common mental disorders in other words pre existing personality traits either cause the development of cmds directly or enhance the impact of causal risk factors 91 160 93 91 165 93 91 166 93 91 167 93 there is strong support for neuroticism being a robust vulnerability factor 91 163 93 the pathoplasty model this model proposes that premorbid personality traits impact the expression course severity and or treatment response of a mental disorder 91 160 93 91 166 93 91 6 93 an example of this relationship would be a heightened likelihood of committing suicide in a depressed individual who also has low levels of constraint 91 166 93 the common cause model according to the common cause model personality traits are predictive of cmds because personality and psychopathology have shared genetic and environmental determinants which result in non causal associations between the two constructs 91 160 93 91 165 93 the spectrum model this model proposes that associations between personality and psychopathology are found because these two constructs both occupy a single domain or spectrum and psychopathology is simply a display of the extremes of normal personality function 91 160 93 91 165 93 91 166 93 91 167 93 support for this model is provided by an issue of criterion overlap for instance two of the primary facet scales of neuroticism in the neo pi r are depression and anxiety thus the fact that diagnostic criteria for depression anxiety and neuroticism assess the same content increases the correlations between these domains 91 167 93 the scar model according to the scar model episodes of a mental disorder scar an individual s personality changing it in significant ways from premorbid functioning 91 160 93 91 165 93 91 166 93 91 167 93 an example of a scar effect would be a decrease in openness to experience following an episode of ptsd 91 166 93 physical health edit to examine how the big five personality traits are related to subjective health outcomes positive and negative mood physical symptoms and general health concern and objective health conditions chronic illness serious illness and physical injuries jasna hudek knezevic and igor kardum conducted a study from a sample of 822 healthy volunteers 438 women and 384 men 91 168 93 out of the big five personality traits they found neuroticism most related to worse subjective health outcomes and optimistic control to better subjective health outcomes when relating to objective health conditions connections drawn were presented weak except that neuroticism significantly predicted chronic illness whereas optimistic control was more closely related to physical injuries caused by accident 91 168 93 being highly conscientious may add as much as five years to one s life 91 vague 93 91 162 93 the big five personality traits also predict positive health outcomes 91 169 93 91 170 93 in an elderly japanese sample conscientiousness extraversion and openness were related to lower risk of mortality 91 171 93 higher conscientiousness is associated with lower obesity risk in already obese individuals higher conscientiousness is associated with a higher likelihood of becoming non obese over a five year period 91 172 93 effect of personality traits through life edit education edit academic achievement edit personality plays an important role in academic achievement a study of 308 undergraduates who completed the five factor inventory processes and reported their gpa suggested that conscientiousness and agreeableness have a positive relationship with all types of learning styles synthesis analysis methodical study fact retention and elaborative processing whereas neuroticism shows an inverse relationship moreover extraversion and openness were proportional to elaborative processing the big five personality traits accounted for 14 of the variance in gpa suggesting that personality traits make some contributions to academic performance furthermore reflective learning styles synthesis analysis and elaborative processing were able to mediate the relationship between openness and gpa these results indicate that intellectual curiosity significantly enhances academic performance if students combine their scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing 91 173 93 a recent study of israeli high school students found that those in the gifted program systematically scored higher on openness and lower on neuroticism than those not in the gifted program while not a measure of the big five gifted students also reported less state anxiety than students not in the gifted program 91 174 93 specific big five personality traits predict learning styles in addition to academic success gpa and exam performance are both predicted by conscientiousness neuroticism is negatively related to academic success openness predicts utilizing synthesis analysis and elaborative processing learning styles neuroticism negatively correlates with learning styles in general openness and extraversion both predict all four learning styles 91 173 93 studies conducted on college students have concluded that hope which is linked to agreeableness 91 175 93 conscientiousness neuroticism and openness 91 175 93 has a positive effect on psychological well being individuals high in neurotic tendencies are less likely to display hopeful tendencies and are negatively associated with well being 91 176 93 personality can sometimes be flexible and measuring the big five personality for individuals as they enter certain stages of life may predict their educational identity recent studies have suggested the likelihood of an individual s personality affecting their educational identity 91 177 93 learning styles edit learning styles have been described as enduring ways of thinking and processing information 91 173 93 in 2008 the association for psychological science aps commissioned a report that concludes that no significant evidence exists that learning style assessments should be included in the education system 91 178 93 thus it is premature at best to conclude that the evidence links the big five to learning styles or learning styles to learning itself however the aps report also suggested that all existing learning styles have not been exhausted and that there could exist learning styles worthy of being included in educational practices there are studies that conclude that personality and thinking styles may be intertwined in ways that link thinking styles to the big five personality traits 91 179 93 there is no general consensus on the number or specifications of particular learning styles but there have been many different proposals as one example schmeck ribich and ramanaiah 1997 defined four types of learning styles 91 180 93 synthesis analysis methodical study fact retention elaborative processing when all four facets are implicated within the classroom they will each likely improve academic achievement 91 173 93 this model asserts that students develop either agentic shallow processing or reflective deep processing deep processors are more often found to be more conscientious intellectually open and extraverted than shallow processors deep processing is associated with appropriate study methods methodical study and a stronger ability to analyze information synthesis analysis whereas shallow processors prefer structured fact retention learning styles and are better suited for elaborative processing 91 173 93 the main functions of these four specific learning styles are as follows name function synthesis analysis processing information forming categories and organizing them into hierarchies this is the only one of the learning styles that has explained a significant impact on academic performance 91 173 93 methodical study methodical behavior while completing academic assignments fact retention focusing on the actual result instead of understanding the logic behind something elaborative processing connecting and applying new ideas to existing knowledge openness has been linked to learning styles that often lead to academic success and higher grades like synthesis analysis and methodical study because conscientiousness and openness have been shown to predict all four learning styles it suggests that individuals who possess characteristics like discipline determination and curiosity are more likely to engage in all of the above learning styles 91 173 93 according to the research carried out by komarraju karau schmeck amp avdic 2011 conscientiousness and agreeableness are positively related with all four learning styles whereas neuroticism was negatively related with those four furthermore extraversion and openness were only positively related to elaborative processing and openness itself correlated with higher academic achievement 91 173 93 in addition a previous study by psychologist mikael jensen has shown relationships between the big five personality traits learning and academic achievement according to jensen all personality traits except neuroticism are associated with learning goals and motivation openness and conscientiousness influence individuals to learn to a high degree unrecognized while extraversion and agreeableness have similar effects 91 181 93 conscientiousness and neuroticism also influence individuals to perform well in front of others for a sense of credit and reward while agreeableness forces individuals to avoid this strategy of learning 91 181 93 jensen s study concludes that individuals who score high on the agreeableness trait will likely learn just to perform well in front of others 91 181 93 besides openness all big five personality traits helped predict the educational identity of students based on these findings scientists are beginning to see that the big five traits might have a large influence of on academic motivation that leads to predicting a student s academic performance 91 177 93 some authors suggested that big five personality traits combined with learning styles can help predict some variations in the academic performance and the academic motivation of an individual which can then influence their academic achievements 91 182 93 this may be seen because individual differences in personality represent stable approaches to information processing for instance conscientiousness has consistently emerged as a stable predictor of success in exam performance largely because conscientious students experience fewer study delays 91 177 93 conscientiousness shows a positive association with the four learning styles because students with high levels of conscientiousness develop focused learning strategies and appear to be more disciplined and achievement oriented personality and learning styles are both likely to play significant roles in influencing academic achievement college students 308 undergraduates completed the five factor inventory and the inventory of learning processes and reported their grade point average two of the big five traits conscientiousness and agreeableness were positively related with all four learning styles synthesis analysis methodical study fact retention and elaborative processing whereas neuroticism was negatively related with all four learning styles in addition extraversion and openness were positively related with elaborative processing the big five together explained 14 of the variance in grade point average gpa and learning styles explained an additional 3 suggesting that both personality traits and learning styles contribute to academic performance further the relationship between openness and gpa was mediated by reflective learning styles synthesis analysis and elaborative processing these latter results suggest that being intellectually curious fully enhances academic performance when students combine this scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing implications of these results are discussed in the context of teaching techniques and curriculum design 8201 m komarraju 91 173 93 distance learning edit when the relationship between the five factor personality traits and academic achievement in distance education settings was examined in brief the openness personality trait was found to be the most important variable that has a positive relationship with academic achievement in distance education environments in addition it was found that self discipline extraversion and adaptability personality traits are generally in a positive relationship with academic achievement the most important personality trait that has a negative relationship with academic achievement has emerged as neuroticism the results generally show that individuals who are organized planned determined who are oriented to new ideas and independent thinking have increased success in distance education environments on the other hand it can be said that individuals with anxiety and stress tendencies generally have lower academic success 91 183 93 91 184 93 91 185 93 employment edit occupation and personality fit edit the vocations map many people in the same role share similar personality traits researchers have long suggested that work is more likely to be fulfilling to the individual and beneficial to society when there is alignment between the person and their occupation 91 186 93 for instance software programmers and scientists were generally more open to experiencing a variety of new activities were intellectually curious tended to think in symbols and abstractions and found repetition boring 91 187 93 work success edit controversy exists as to whether or not the big 5 personality traits are correlated with success in the workplace it is believed that the big five traits are predictors of future performance outcomes job outcome measures include job and training proficiency and personnel data 91 188 93 however research demonstrating such prediction has been criticized in part because of the apparently low correlation coefficients characterizing the relationship between personality and job performance in a 2007 article 91 189 93 co authored by six current or former editors of psychological journals dr kevin murphy professor of psychology at pennsylvania state university and editor of the journal of applied psychology 1996 2002 states the problem with personality tests is 160 that the validity of personality measures as predictors of job performance is often disappointingly low the argument for using personality tests to predict performance does not strike me as convincing in the first place such criticisms were put forward by walter mischel 91 190 93 whose publication caused a two decades long crisis in personality psychometrics however later work demonstrated 1 that the correlations obtained by psychometric personality researchers were actually very respectable by comparative standards 91 191 93 and 2 that the economic value of even incremental increases in prediction accuracy was exceptionally large given the vast difference in performance by those who occupy complex job positions 91 192 93 there have been studies that link national innovation to openness to experience and conscientiousness those who express these traits have showed leadership and beneficial ideas towards the country of origin 91 193 93 some businesses organizations and interviewers assess individuals based on the big five personality traits research has suggested that individuals who are considered leaders typically exhibit lower amounts of neurotic traits maintain higher levels of openness envisioning success balanced levels of conscientiousness well organized and balanced levels of extraversion outgoing but not excessive 91 194 93 further studies have linked professional burnout to neuroticism and extraversion to enduring positive work experience 91 195 93 when it comes to making money research has suggested that those who are high in agreeableness especially men are not as successful in accumulating income 91 196 93 some research suggests that vocational outcomes are correlated to big five personality traits conscientiousness predicts job performance in general conscientiousness is considered as top ranked in overall job performance 91 47 93 research further categorized the big 5 behaviors into 3 perspectives task performance organizational citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior task performance is the set of activity that a worker is hired to complete and results showed that extraversion ranked second after the conscientiousness with emotional stability tied with agreeableness ranked third for organizational citizenship behavior relatively less tied to the specific task core but benefits an organization by contributing to its social and psychological environment agreeableness and emotional stability ranked second and third lastly agreeableness tied with conscientiousness as top ranked for counterproductive work behavior which refers to intentional behavior that is counter to the legitimate interests of the organization or its members 91 47 93 in addition research has demonstrated that agreeableness is negatively related to salary those high in agreeableness make less on average than those low in the same trait neuroticism is also negatively related to salary while conscientiousness and extraversion are positive predictors of salary 91 197 93 occupational self efficacy has also been shown to be positively correlated with conscientiousness and negatively correlated with neuroticism significant predictors of career advancement goals are extraversion conscientiousness and agreeableness 91 197 93 some research has also suggested that the conscientiousness of a supervisor is positively associated with an employee s perception of abusive supervision 91 198 93 while others have suggested that those with low agreeableness and high neuroticism are traits more related to abusive supervision 91 199 93 a 2019 study of canadian adults found conscientiousness to be positively associated with wages while agreeableness extraversion and neuroticism were negatively associated with wages in the united states by contrast no negative correlation between extraversion and wages has been found also the magnitudes found for agreeableness and conscientiousness in this study were higher for women than for men i e there was a higher negative penalty for greater agreeableness in women as well as a higher positive reward for greater conscientiousness 91 200 93 research designed to investigate the individual effects of big five personality traits on work performance via worker completed surveys and supervisor ratings of work performance has implicated individual traits in several different work roles performances a work role is defined as the responsibilities an individual has while they are working nine work roles have been identified which can be classified in three broader categories proficiency the ability of a worker to effectively perform their work duties adaptivity a workers ability to change working strategies in response to changing work environments and proactivity extent to which a worker will spontaneously put forth effort to change the work environment these three categories of behavior can then be directed towards three different levels either the individual team or organizational level leading to the nine different work role performance possibilities 91 201 93 openness is positively related to proactivity at the individual and the organizational levels and is negatively related to team and organizational proficiency these effects were found to be completely independent of one another this is also counter conscientious and has a negative correlation to conscientiousness 91 202 93 agreeableness is negatively related to individual task proactivity typically this is associated with lower career success and being less able to cope with conflict 91 202 93 extraversion is negatively related to individual task proficiency extraversion has a higher job and life satisfaction but more impulsive behaviors 91 202 93 conscientiousness is positively related to all forms of work role performance this has a higher leadership effectiveness and lower deviance behaviors but also lower learning in skill acquisition 91 202 93 neuroticism is negatively related to all forms of work role performance this has a trend to engage in more risky behaviors 91 202 93 91 201 93 two theories have been integrated in an attempt to account for these differences in work role performance trait activation theory posits that within a person trait levels predict future behavior that trait levels differ between people and that work related cues activate traits which leads to work relevant behaviors role theory suggests that role senders provide cues to elicit desired behaviors in this context role senders i e supervisors managers etc provide workers with cues for expected behaviors which in turn activates personality traits and work relevant behaviors in essence expectations of the role sender lead to different behavioral outcomes depending on the trait levels of individual workers and because people differ in trait levels responses to these cues will not be universal 91 201 93 romantic relationships edit the big five model of personality was used for attempts to predict satisfaction in romantic relationships relationship quality in dating engaged and married couples 91 203 93 dating couples self reported relationship quality is negatively related to partner reported neuroticism and positively related to both self and partner reported conscientiousness 91 203 93 engaged couples self reported relationship quality was higher among those high in partner reported openness agreeableness and conscientiousness self reported relationship quality was higher among those high in self reported extraversion and agreeableness self reported relationship quality is negatively related to both self and partner reported neuroticism observers rated the relationship quality higher if the participating partner s self reported extraversion was high 91 203 93 married couples high self reported neuroticism extraversion and agreeableness are related to high levels of self reported relationship quality partner reported agreeableness is related to observed relationship quality 91 203 93 these reports are however rare and not conclusive political identification edit the big five personality model also has applications in the study of political psychology studies have been finding links between the big five personality traits and political identification it has been found by several studies that individuals who score high in conscientiousness are more likely to possess a right wing political identification 91 204 93 91 205 93 91 206 93 on the opposite end of the spectrum a strong correlation was identified between high scores in openness to experience and a left leaning ideology 91 204 93 91 207 93 91 208 93 while the traits of agreeableness extraversion and neuroticism have not been consistently linked to either conservative or liberal ideology with studies producing mixed results such traits are promising when analyzing the strength of an individual s party identification 91 207 93 91 208 93 however correlations between the big five and political beliefs while present tend to be small with one study finding correlations ranged from 0 14 to 0 24 91 209 93 scope of predictive power edit the predictive effects of the big five personality traits relate mostly to social functioning and rules driven behavior and are not very specific for prediction of particular aspects of behavior for example it was noted that high neuroticism precedes the development of all common mental disorders 91 163 93 and is not associated with personality by all temperament researchers 91 81 93 further evidence is required to fully uncover the nature and differences between personality traits temperament and life outcomes social and contextual parameters also play a role in outcomes and the interaction between the two is not yet fully understood 91 210 93 religiosity edit though the effect sizes are small of the big five personality traits high agreeableness conscientiousness and extraversion relate to general religiosity while openness relate negatively to religious fundamentalism and positively to spirituality high neuroticism may be related to extrinsic religiosity whereas intrinsic religiosity and spirituality reflect emotional stability 91 211 93 measurements edit several measures of the big five exist international personality item pool ipip 91 212 93 neo pi r the ten item personality inventory tipi and the five item personality inventory fipi are very abbreviated rating forms of the big five personality traits 91 213 93 self descriptive sentence questionnaires 91 142 93 lexical questionnaires 91 214 93 self report questionnaires 91 215 93 relative scored big 5 measure 91 216 93 the most frequently used measures of the big five comprise either items that are self descriptive sentences 91 142 93 or in the case of lexical measures items that are single adjectives 91 214 93 due to the length of sentence based and some lexical measures short forms have been developed and validated for use in applied research settings where questionnaire space and respondent time are limited such as the 40 item balanced international english big five mini markers 91 135 93 or a very brief 10 item measure of the big five domains 91 217 93 research has suggested that some methodologies in administering personality tests are inadequate in length and provide insufficient detail to truly evaluate personality usually longer more detailed questions will give a more accurate portrayal of personality 91 218 93 the five factor structure has been replicated in peer reports 91 219 93 however many of the substantive findings rely on self reports much of the evidence on the measures of the big 5 relies on self report questionnaires which makes self report bias and falsification of responses difficult to deal with and account for 91 215 93 it has been argued that the big five tests do not create an accurate personality profile because the responses given on these tests are not true in all cases and can be falsified 91 220 93 for example questionnaires are answered by potential employees who might choose answers that paint them in the best light 91 221 93 research suggests that a relative scored big five measure in which respondents had to make repeated choices between equally desirable personality descriptors may be a potential alternative to traditional big five measures in accurately assessing personality traits especially when lying or biased responding is present 91 216 93 when compared with a traditional big five measure for its ability to predict gpa and creative achievement under both normal and fake good bias response conditions the relative scored measure significantly and consistently predicted these outcomes under both conditions however the likert questionnaire lost its predictive ability in the faking condition thus the relative scored measure proved to be less affected by biased responding than the likert measure of the big five andrew h schwartz analyzed 700 million words phrases and topic instances collected from the facebook messages of 75 000 volunteers who also took standard personality tests and found striking variations in language with personality gender and age 91 222 93 critique edit the proposed big five model has been subjected to considerable critical scrutiny in a number of published studies 91 223 93 91 224 93 91 225 93 91 226 93 91 227 93 91 228 93 91 60 93 91 229 93 91 81 93 one prominent critic of the model has been jack block at the university of california berkeley in response to block the model was defended in a paper published by costa and mccrae 91 230 93 this was followed by a number of published critical replies from block 91 231 93 91 232 93 91 233 93 it has been argued that there are limitations to the scope of the big five model as an explanatory or predictive theory 91 60 93 91 229 93 it has also been argued that measures of the big five account for only 56 of the normal personality trait sphere alone not even considering the abnormal personality trait sphere 91 60 93 also the static big five 91 234 93 is not theory driven it is merely a statistically driven investigation of certain descriptors that tend to cluster together often based on less than optimal factor analytic procedures 91 60 93 58 8202 431 33 8202 91 81 93 measures of the big five constructs appear to show some consistency in interviews self descriptions and observations and this static five factor structure seems to be found across a wide range of participants of different ages and cultures 91 235 93 however while genotypic temperament trait dimensions might appear across different cultures the phenotypic expression of personality traits differs profoundly across different cultures as a function of the different socio cultural conditioning and experiential learning that takes place within different cultural settings 91 236 93 moreover the fact that the big five model was based on lexical hypothesis i e on the verbal descriptors of individual differences indicated strong methodological flaws in this model especially related to its main factors extraversion and neuroticism first there is a natural pro social bias of language in people s verbal evaluations after all language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization and the exchange of information and to synchronize group activity this social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behavior there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior the sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into the largest factor in any language and such grouping has nothing to do with the way that core systems of individual differences are set up second there is also a negativity bias in emotionality i e most emotions have negative affectivity and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another bias in language experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability bias of language and a negativity bias of emotionality grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions 91 227 93 this means that the two largest dimensions in the big five model might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed limited scope edit one common criticism is that the big five does not explain all of human personality some psychologists have dissented from the model precisely because they feel it neglects other domains of personality such as religiosity manipulativeness machiavellianism honesty sexiness seductiveness thriftiness conservativeness masculinity femininity snobbishness egotism sense of humour and risk taking thrill seeking 91 228 93 91 237 93 dan p mcadams has called the big five a psychology of the stranger because they refer to traits that are relatively easy to observe in a stranger other aspects of personality that are more privately held or more context dependent are excluded from the big five 91 238 93 there may be debate as to what counts as personality and what does not and the nature of the questions in the survey greatly influence outcome multiple particularly broad question databases have failed to produce the big five as the top five traits 91 239 93 in many studies the five factors are not fully orthogonal to one another that is the five factors are not independent 91 240 93 91 241 93 orthogonality is viewed as desirable by some researchers because it minimizes redundancy between the dimensions this is particularly important when the goal of a study is to provide a comprehensive description of personality with as few variables as possible methodological issues edit factor analysis the statistical method used to identify the dimensional structure of observed variables lacks a universally recognized basis for choosing among solutions with different numbers of factors 91 242 93 a five factor solution depends on some degree of interpretation by the analyst a larger number of factors may underlie these five factors this has led to disputes about the true number of factors big five proponents have responded that although other solutions may be viable in a single data set only the five factor structure consistently replicates across different studies 91 243 93 surveys in studies are often online surveys of college students results do not always replicate when run on other populations or in other languages 91 244 93 moreover the factor analysis that this model is based on is a linear method incapable of capturing nonlinear feedback and contingent relationships between core systems of individual differences 91 227 93 theoretical status edit a frequent criticism is that the big five is not based on any underlying theory it is merely an empirical finding that certain descriptors cluster together under factor analysis 91 242 93 although this does not mean that these five factors do not exist the underlying causes behind them are unknown jack block s final published work before his death in january 2010 drew together his lifetime perspective on the five factor model 91 245 93 he summarized his critique of the model in terms of the atheoretical nature of the five factors their cloudy measurement the model s inappropriateness for studying early childhood the use of factor analysis as the exclusive paradigm for conceptualizing personality the continuing non consensual understandings of the five factors the existence of unrecognized but successful efforts to specify aspects of character not subsumed by the five factors he went on to suggest that repeatedly observed higher order factors hierarchically above the proclaimed big five personality traits may promise deeper biological understanding of the origins and implications of these superfactors evidence for six factors rather than five edit it has been noted that even though early lexical studies in the english language indicated five large groups of personality traits more recent and more comprehensive cross language studies have provided evidence for six large groups rather than five 91 246 93 with the sixth factor being honesty humility these six groups form the basis of the hexaco model of personality structure based on these findings it has been suggested that the big five system should be replaced by hexaco or revised to better align with lexical evidence 91 247 93 see also edit core self evaluations dark triad disc assessment facet genomics of personality traits goal orientation
