surprise suspicion trust wonder worry vte remorse is a distressing emotion experienced by an individual who regrets actions which they have done in the past 91 1 93 that they deem to be shameful hurtful or wrong remorse is closely allied to guilt and self directed resentment when a person regrets an earlier action or failure to act it may be because of remorse or in response to various other consequences including being punished for the act or omission people may express remorse through apologies trying to repair the damage they ve caused or self imposed punishments in a legal context the perceived remorse of an offender is assessed by western justice systems during trials sentencing parole hearings and in restorative justice however there are epistemological problems with assessing an offender s level of remorse 91 2 93 a person who is incapable of feeling remorse is often diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as characterized in the dsm iv tr in general a person needs to be unable to feel fear as well as remorse in order to develop psychopathic traits legal and business professions such as insurance have done research on the expression of remorse via apologies primarily because of the potential litigation and financial implications contents 1 studies on apologizing 2 falsified expressions 3 psychopathy 4 forgiveness 5 versus self condemnation 6 buyer s remorse 7 see also 8 references 9 external links studies on apologizing edit two studies on apologising are the five languages of apology by gary chapman and jennifer thomas 91 3 93 and on apology by aaron lazare 91 4 93 these studies indicate that effective apologies that express remorse typically include a detailed account of the offense acknowledgment of the hurt or damage done acceptance of the responsibility for and ownership of the act or omission an explanation that recognises one s role as well apologies usually include a statement or expression of regret humility or remorse a request for forgiveness and an expression of a credible commitment to change or a promise that it will not happen again apologies may also include some form of restitution compensation or token gesture in line with the damage that one has caused john kleefeld has encapsulated this into four rs that typically make for a fully effective apology remorse responsibility resolution and reparation 91 5 93 when an apology is delayed for instance if a friend has been wronged and the offending party does not apologise the perception of the offense can compound over time this is sometimes 91 quantify 93 known as compounding remorse 91 citation needed 93 compunction 91 6 93 refers to the act of actively expressing remorse 91 citation needed 93 usually requiring remorseful individuals to physically approach the person to whom they wish to express regret falsified expressions edit in a study led by leanne ten brinke a professor at the university of british columbia participants genuine and falsified emotions were studied to investigate behavioral and facial cues brinke and others found a significant difference in the presence of facial expressions in real and false remorse with falsified emotions of remorse they found that the participants experienced a greater range of emotions which are close to genuine feelings while deceptive descriptions of remorse were associated with positive emotions such as happiness and surprise 91 7 93 the positive emotions felt by participants demonstrating a deceptive description of remorse are likely due to the leakage of genuine feelings from incomplete deception brinke and others established that participants appeared surprised because they could only raise their eyebrows when trying to appear sad which then caused the participants to feel embarrassed feel genuine happiness and let a smile slip 91 7 93 in contrast to deceptive and falsified accounts genuine accounts were expressed with fewer emotions participants showing deceptive or falsified emotions overcompensated their emotional performance genuine negative feelings of remorse leaked by the lower face were immediately covered up with a neutral expression brinke recorded a small number of body language and verbal cues for deceptive participants instead she recorded a large number of speech hesitations that cued deceptive and falsified accounts of remorse 91 7 93 current findings of deceptive and falsified remorse have a practical use for measuring the veracity of remorseful displays for judges jurors parole officers and psychologists when sentencing offenders psychopathy edit main article psychopathy psychopathic individuals are best known for their flagrant disregard for social and moral norms psychopaths have dysfunctional personal relationships characterized by violence exploitation and philandering emotionally they are incapable of feeling guilt or empathy they respond abnormally to fear and pain and other emotions are shallow compared to population norms 91 8 93 psychopaths refuse to adopt social and moral norms because they are not swayed by the emotions such as guilt remorse or fear of retribution that influence other human beings 91 8 93 human societies tend to value remorse conversely a person who exhibits a lack of remorse is often perceived in a negative light it is widely accepted that remorse is the proper reaction to misconduct remorse may originate in from either actual or contrived regret for the misconduct that results in being caught or causing harm 91 9 93 research has shown that the facial expressions of offenders on trial affect the jury s attitude and in turn the sentencing decision while remorse may present guilt that may influence a jury s decision a lack of remorse influences the jury even more because it is one trait of psychopathy psychopathy represents a configuration of traits that are missing within a person s personality such as a lack of empathy and remorse knowledge of psychopathic traits has been shown to affect how jurors perceive adult and juvenile offenders assessments of psychopathy are introduced to direct a relatively wide variety of questions in the legal system so investigators have started examining the effects of psychopathy evidences 91 10 93 through simulations in studies by john edens who is a psychology professor at texas a amp m university data suggests that attributing psychopathic traits to adult and juvenile offenders can have a noticeable negative effect on how these individuals are viewed by others 91 10 93 remorselessness a key feature of psychopathy proves to be a strong predictor of juror attitudes 91 10 93 in the study by john edens a pool of offenders were labeled as either having a disorder condition or having no disorder those labeled as disorder were given death verdicts by mock jurors 91 10 93 in the study traits such as callousness remorselessness and superficial charm were a strong predictor of negative consequences for the offenders this study found that remorselessness has the largest effect on the mock jurors opinions of the disorder offenders and it explains support for the death sentence 91 10 93 the results of this study suggest that free of mental health testimonies perceptions of a defendant s personality traits may have serious implications in the sentencing decisions of a capital case 91 10 93 forgiveness edit the perception of remorse is essential to an apology and the greater the perception of remorse the more effective the apology an effective apology reduces negative consequences and facilitates cognitive and behavioral changes associated with forgiveness 91 11 93 with empathy as the mediator between apologies and forgiveness and remorse as the essential part to an apology one can expect empathy to mediate perceived remorse forgiveness remorse may signal that one is suffering psychologically because of one s negative behavior which leads to empathy from the victim who may then express forgiveness 91 11 93 in a study by james davis and greg gold 170 university students filled out questionnaires about forgiveness within interpersonal relationships davis and gold s findings suggest that when a victim perceives an apology to be remorseful then they believe the negative behavior will not occur again and they will be more willing to forgive the perpetrator 91 11 93 versus self condemnation edit remorse is closely linked with the willingness to humble oneself and to repent for one s misdeeds remorse is not as such when defined through the view of self condemnation 91 12 93 self condemnation more so than remorse is said to be associated with poor psychological well being remorse captures feelings of guilt regret and sorrow forgiveness does not eliminate all negative feelings but it may entail the reduction of bitter and angry feelings not feelings of disappointment regret or sorrow a study by mickie fisher found that people who forgive themselves for serious offenses may continue to harbor remorse or regret 91 12 93 in contrast to remorse self condemnation reflects a more global negative severe stance toward oneself remorse may convey a sense of sorrow while self condemnation suggests the kind of loathing and desire for punishment that characterizes interpersonal grudges fisher suggests that self forgiveness does not necessarily require one to get rid of feelings or regret or remorse 91 12 93 based on the study by fisher self forgiveness seems to relate more closely to self condemnation and not remorse when trying to convince people to forgive themselves it is crucial not to erase the potentially adaptive feelings of remorse along with the more destructive self condemnation 91 12 93 people can grow and experience prosocial behaviors once they accept responsibility for their own transgressions for genuine self forgiveness one must first accept responsibility for their offenses and not rush to rid themselves of guilty feelings buyer s remorse edit main article buyer s remorse purchases can be divided into two different categories material or experiential a material good is made to be kept in the buyer s possession while an experiential good provides the buyer with life experience a material good provides the buyer with a more enduring pleasure compared with an experiential as these two purchases also result in different types of regret 91 13 93 while experiential purchases bring about regrets of a missed opportunity material purchases result in buyer s remorse which means that a person dwells on how their material purchase measure up to other purchases they could have made and how it compares with other people s purchases these comparisons diminish satisfaction from the original purpose 91 13 93 past research explains that regrets of action are intense but only in the short term while regrets of inaction gains intensity over time and dominates people s experience major life choices such as marriage jobs and education are often the focus of regret everyday experience suggests that everyday decisions are the most frequent causes of regret 91 13 93 marketing directors know the effects of buyer s remorse and use it to their advantage when planning marketing strategies the regret felt over choosing a material over an experiential purchase depends on the pain of the factors underlying the purchase based on research by thomas gilovich and emily rosenzwig material purchases are more likely to lead to regret while experiential purchases give the buyer more satisfaction even over time 91 13 93 see also
