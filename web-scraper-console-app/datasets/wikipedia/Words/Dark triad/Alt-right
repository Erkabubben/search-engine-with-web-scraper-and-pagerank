is a far right white nationalist movement a largely online phenomenon the alt right originated in the united states during the late 2000s before increasing in popularity during the mid 2010s and establishing a presence in other countries and then declining since 2017 the term is ill defined having been used in different ways by alt right members media commentators journalists and academics in 2010 the american white nationalist richard b spencer launched the alternative right webzine his alternative right was influenced by earlier forms of american white nationalism as well as paleoconservatism the dark enlightenment and the nouvelle droite his term was shortened to alt right and popularised by far right participants of pol the politics board of web forum 4chan it came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups including andrew anglin s daily stormer brad griffin s occidental dissent and matthew heimbach s traditionalist worker party following the 2014 gamergate controversy the alt right made increasing use of trolling and online harassment to raise its profile in 2015 it attracted broader attention particularly through coverage on steve bannon s breitbart news due to alt right support for donald trump s 2016 presidential campaign upon being elected trump disavowed the movement attempting to move from a web based to a street based movement spencer and other alt rightists organized the august 2017 unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia which led to violent clashes with counter demonstrators the fallout from the rally resulted in a decline of the alt right the alt right movement espouses the pseudoscientific idea of biological racism and promotes a form of identity politics in favor of european americans and white people internationally anti egalitarian it rejects the liberal democratic basis of u s governance and opposes both the conservative and liberal wings of the country s political mainstream many of its members seek to replace the u s with a white separatist ethno state some alt rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable while others known as the 1488 scene adopt openly white supremacist and neo nazi stances to shock and provoke some alt rightists are antisemitic promoting a conspiracy theory that there is a jewish plot to bring about white genocide although other alt rightists view most jews as members of the white race the alt right is anti feminist and intersects with the online manosphere the alt right also opposes islam the movement distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor particularly through the promotion of internet memes like pepe the frog individuals aligned with many of the alt right s ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed alt lite the alt right s membership is overwhelmingly white and male attracted to the movement by deteriorating living standards and prospects anxieties about the social role of white masculinity and anger at left wing and non white forms of identity politics such as feminism and black lives matter alt right material has contributed to the radicalization of men responsible for various murders and terrorist attacks in the u s since 2014 critics charge that the term alt right is merely a rebranding of white supremacism 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 91 4 93 contents 1 definition 2 history 2 1 influences 2 2 2008 2014 origins 2 3 2014 2017 rise and peak in popularity 2 3 1 mainstream emergence 2 3 2 breitbart

term alt right is an abbreviation of alternative right 91 5 93 a distinct far right movement arising in the 2010s it both drew on older far right ideas and displayed novelties 91 6 93 efforts to define the alt right have been complicated by the contradictory ways in which self described alt rightists have defined the movement and by the tendency among some of its political opponents to apply the term alt right liberally to a broad range of right wing groups and viewpoints 91 7 93 as the alt right rose to wider awareness around 2016 media sources struggled to understand it 91 8 93 some commentators applied the term as a catch all for anyone they deemed far right 91 9 93 the scholars patrik hermansson david lawrence joe mulhall and simon murdoch noted that in the press and broadcast media the term had been used to describe everything from hardcore nazis and holocaust deniers through to mainstream republicans in the us and right wing populists in europe 91 10 93 consequently because the term alt right was coined by white nationalists themselves rather than by academic observers or by their opponents various journalists avoided it 91 11 93 91 12 93 george hawley a political scientist specializing in the u s far right disagreed with this approach noting that using terms like white supremacist in place of alt right conceals the way that alt right differed from other far right movements 91 13 93 the alt right or alternative right is a name currently embraced by some white supremacists and white nationalists to refer to themselves and their ideology which emphasizes preserving and protecting the white race in the united states in addition to or over other traditional conservative positions such as limited government low taxes and strict law and order the movement has been described as a mix of racism white nationalism and populism criticizes multiculturalism and more rights for non whites women jews muslims gays immigrants and other minorities its members reject the american democratic ideal that all should have equality under the law regardless of creed gender ethnic origin or race the associated press 91 14 93 91 15 93 hermansson et al defined the alt right as a far right anti globalist grouping that operated primarily online though with offline outlets they noted that its core belief is that white identity is under attack from pro multicultural and liberal elites and so called social justice warriors sjws who allegedly use political correctness to undermine western civilisation and the rights of white males 91 16 93 the anti fascist researcher matthew n lyons defined the alt right as a loosely organized far right movement that shares a contempt for both liberal multiculturalism and mainstream conservatism a belief that some people are inherently superior to others a strong internet presence and embrace of specific elements of online culture and a self presentation as being new hip and irreverent 91 17 93 in the columbia journalism review the journalist chava gourarie labelled it a rag tag coalition operating as a diffuse online subculture that had an inclination for vicious online trolling with some roots in fringe right ideologies 91 8 93 in the new york times journalists aishvarya kavi and alan feuer defined the alt right as a loosely affiliated collection of racists misogynists and islamophobes that rose to prominence around the time of mr trump s first campaign 91 18 93 the academic tom pollard referred to the alt right as a socio political movement comprising a loose amalgamation of rightist groups and causes who shun egalitarianism socialism feminism miscegenation multiculturalism free trade globalization and all forms of gun control 91 19 93 the journalist mike wendling termed it an incredibly loose set of ideologies held together by what they oppose feminism islam the black lives matter movement political correctness a fuzzy idea they call globalism and establishment politics of both the left and the right 91 20 93 the southern poverty law center defined the alt right as a set of far right ideologies groups and individuals whose core belief is that white identity is under attack by multicultural forces using political correctness and social justice to undermine white people and their civilization 91 21 93 the anti defamation league states that alt right is a vague term actually encompass ing a range of people on the extreme right who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of forms of conservatism that embrace implicit or explicit racism or white supremacy 91 22 93 the encyclop dia britannica defined the alt right as a loose association of relatively young white nationalists who largely disavowed racism but celebrated white identity and lamented the alleged erosion of white political and economic power and the decline of white culture in the face of nonwhite immigration and multiculturalism white supremacists extreme libertarians and neo nazis 91 23 93 91 24 93 history see also fascism in the united states radical right united states trumpism and neo fascism influences the alt right had various ideological forebears 91 25 93 the idea of white supremacy had been dominant across u s political discourse throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries after world war ii it was increasingly repudiated and relegated to the far right of the country s political spectrum 91 26 93 far right groups retaining such ideas such as george lincoln rockwell s american nazi party and william luther pierce s national alliance remained marginal 91 27 93 by the 1990s white supremacism was largely confined to neo nazi and ku klux klan kkk groups although its ideologues wanted to return it to the mainstream 91 26 93 that decade several white supremacists reformulated their ideas as white nationalism through which they presented themselves not as seeking to dominate non white racial groups but rather as lobbying for the interests of european americans in a similar way to how civil rights groups lobbied for the rights of african americans and hispanic americans 91 28 93 although white nationalists often distanced themselves from white supremacism white supremacist sentiment remained prevalent in white nationalist writings 91 29 93 the american white nationalist ideologue jared taylor became a revered figure among the alt right and the events organized by his american renaissance group were attended by many alt right members 91 30 93 american white nationalists believed that the united states had been created as a nation explicitly for white people of european descent and that it should remain that way 91 31 93 many called for the formation of an explicitly white ethno state 91 29 93 seeking to distance themselves from the violent skinhead image of neo nazi and kkk groups several white nationalist ideologues namely jared taylor peter brimelow and kevin b macdonald sought to cultivate an image of respectability and intellectualism through which to promote their views 91 32 93 hawley later termed their ideology highbrow white nationalism and noted its particular influence on the alt right 91 33 93 taylor for instance became a revered figure in alt right circles 91 30 93 under the republican presidency of george w bush in the 2000s the white nationalist movement focused largely on criticizing conservatives rather than liberals accusing them of betraying white americans 91 34 93 in that period they drew increasingly on the conspiracy theories that had been generated by the patriot movement since the 1990s online the white nationalist and patriot movements increasingly converged 91 34 93 following the election of democratic party candidate barack obama to the presidency in 2008 making him the first black president of the country the world views of various right wing movements including white supremacists patriots and tea partiers increasingly began to coalesce in part due to a shared racial animus against obama 91 35 93 the alt right drew upon several older currents of right wing thought one was the nouvelle droite a far right movement that originated in 1960s france before spreading elsewhere in europe 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 many alt rightists adopted the nouvelle droite s views on pursuing long term cultural change through metapolitical strategies 91 39 93 it thereby shares similarities with european identitarianism which also draws upon the nouvelle droite 91 40 93 the alt right also exhibited similarities with the paleoconservative movement which emerged in the u s during the 1980s both opposed neoconservatism and expressed similar positions on restricting immigration and supporting an openly nationalistic foreign policy although unlike the alt right the paleoconservatives were typically closely aligned to christianity and wanted to reform the conservative movement rather than destroy it 91 41 93 91 42 93 91 43 93 certain paleoconservatives such as samuel t francis became especially close to white nationalism 91 44 93 there were also links between the american right libertarian movement and the alt right despite libertarianism s general repudiation of identity politics 91 45 93 many senior alt rightists previously considered themselves libertarians 91 46 93 and right libertarian theorist murray rothbard has been cited as a particular link between the two movements due to his staunch anti egalitarianism and support for ideas about differing iq levels among racial groups 91 47 93 91 48 93 also cited in connection with the alt right was the dark enlightenment or neo reactionary movement which emerged online in the 2000s pursuing an anti egalitarian message 91 49 93 this movement intersected with the alt right 91 50 93 many individuals identified with both movements 91 51 93 the dark enlightenment however was not white nationalist deeming the latter insufficiently elitist 91 52 93 according to dean in the 1990s there were alt right usenet groups that consisted of fringe libertarians anarcho capitalists and fans of american writer and philosopher ayn rand who advocated for the abolition of the state in favor of private property and markets 91 53 93 prior to recently the american far right did not harness the internet quickly effectively or widely enough to gain traction 91 54 93 2008 2014 origins according to hawley the alt right began in 2008 91 55 93 in november that year the paleoconservative ideologue and academic paul gottfried gave a talk at his h l mencken club in baltimore although the talk was titled the decline and rise of the alternative right it did not contain the phrase alternative right itself gottfried observed that as the paleoconservative movement declined a new cohort of young right wingers were rising to take its place in challenging the neoconservative ideology then dominant in the republican party and broader u s conservative movement 91 56 93 91 57 93 richard b spencer claimed to have coined the term alternative right in 2008 one of those endorsing gottfried s idea was fellow paleoconservative richard b spencer 91 58 93 born in 1978 to a wealthy family and raised in dallas texas 91 59 93 91 60 93 in 2007 spencer had dropped out of his phd programme at duke university to take up a position at the american conservative magazine 91 61 93 91 62 93 spencer claimed he coined the term alternative right for the lecture s title although gottfried maintained that they were its joint creators 91 63 93 as alternative right became associated increasingly with white nationalism in subsequent years gottfried distanced himself from it 91 64 93 after the american conservative fired spencer in 2008 he became managing director of taki theodoracopulos s right wing website taki s magazine 91 65 93 91 66 93 the website initially contained contributions largely from paleoconservatives and right libertarians but under spencer also gave space to white nationalists like taylor 91 67 93 in 2009 spencer used the term alternative right in the title of an article by white nationalist kevin deanna 91 68 93 by 2010 spencer had moved fully from paleoconservatism to white nationalism 91 58 93 although various later press sources instead called him a white supremacist 91 69 93 91 70 93 91 71 93 leaving taki s magazine in march 2010 spencer launched the alternative right webzine 91 72 93 91 73 93 early issues featured articles by white nationalists like taylor and macdonald as well as the heathen stephen mcnallen 91 74 93 spencer noted that if you look at the initial articles for alternativeright com that was the first stage of the alt right really coming into its own 91 74 93 alternativeright com consisted primarily of short essays 91 75 93 covering a range of political and cultural issues 91 76 93 many of these reflected the influence of the french nouvelle droite although this declined as the alt right grew 91 77 93 spencer later stated that he wanted to create a movement distinct from the white power image of neo nazi and kkk groups noting that their approach to white nationalism was a total nonstarter no one outside a hardcore coterie would identify with it 91 78 93 in 2011 spencer became the head of the white nationalist national policy institute and launched the radix journal to promote his views 91 79 93 in 2012 he stepped down from the alternativeright website and took it offline in december 2013 91 80 93 by that year spencer was expressing ambivalence about the alternative right label 91 81 93 he preferred to be called an identitarian 91 60 93 2014 2017 rise and peak in popularity mainstream emergence on the internet spencer s term alternative right was adopted and abbreviated to alt right 91 68 93 according to slate magazine the abbreviation retains the former phrase s associations the mix of alienation and optimism embedded in the act of proudly affirming an alternative direction but compacts them into a snappier package 91 57 93 the alt right tag was created with public relations in mind allowing white nationalists to soften their image and helping to draw in recruits from conservatism 91 82 93 many white nationalists gravitated to the term to escape the negative connotations of the term white nationalism 91 83 93 spencer thought that by this point the alt right had become the banner of white identity politics 91 84 93 the daily stormer is named for the nazi tabloid der st rmer known for its antisemitic caricatures this 1934 billboard for der st rmer reads with der st rmer against judea the jews are our misfortune the term gained wider usage on websites like 4chan and reddit growing in popularity in 2015 91 85 93 although there had previously been a strong left libertarian contingent to these online spaces there was a gradual rightward turn in chan culture centred on 4chan s politics board pol during the early mid 2010s 91 86 93 according to hawley the alt right was an outgrowth of internet troll culture 91 87 93 with hermansson et al observing that online antagonistic communities were key to the formation of the alt right as a distinct movement 91 6 93 the alt right s emergence was marked by the online gamergate controversy of 2014 in which some gamers harassed those promoting feminism within the gaming scene 91 88 93 91 89 93 according to the journalist david neiwert gamergate heralded the rise of the alt right and provided an early sketch of its primary features an internet presence beset by digital trolls unbridled conspiracism angry white male identity victimization culture and ultimately open racism anti semitism ethnic hatred misogyny and sexual and gender paranoia 91 90 93 gamergate politicized many young people especially males in opposition to the perceived culture war being waged by leftists 91 91 93 through their shared opposition to political correctness feminism and multiculturalism chan culture built a link to the alt right 91 92 93 by 2015 the alt right had gained significant momentum as an online movement 91 93 93 notable promoters of the alt right included spencer 91 94 93 vox day 91 95 93 and brittany pettibone 91 96 93 earlier white nationalist thinkers were also characterized as alt right thinkers among them taylor 91 97 93 and macdonald 91 14 93 other prominent alt rightists included brad griffin a member of the neo confederate league of the south who founded the occidental dissent blog 91 98 93 matthew heimbach who established the traditionalist youth network in 2013 91 99 93 and andrew anglin who launched the daily stormer website named after the der st rmer newspaper active in nazi germany in 2013 91 100 93 by 2016 anglin called the daily stormer the world s most visited alt right website 91 101 93 while some of the websites associated with the alt right like the daily stormer and the traditionalist youth network adopted neo nazi approaches others such as occidental dissent the unz review vox popoli and chateau heartiste adopted a less extreme form of white nationalism 91 102 93 breitbart news and the alt lite far more widely visited than these alt right websites was breitbart news which between 2016 and 2018 received over 10 million unique visitors a month 91 103 93 launched by the conservative andrew breitbart in 2005 it came under the control of steve bannon in 2012 91 104 93 a right wing nationalist and populist 91 105 93 bannon was hostile to mainstream conservatism 91 106 93 although much of breitbart 39 s coverage fed into racially charged narratives it did not promote white nationalism 91 105 93 differing from the mainstream conservative press more in tone than in content 91 105 93 alt rightists termed breitbart alt lite 91 103 93 this term appeared in the alt right s language in mid 2016 used pejoratively for rightists who shared their contempt for mainstream conservatism but not their white nationalism 91 107 93 breitbart news amplified and popularised alt right ideas under the editorship of alt lite figure steve bannon left its articles by milo yiannopoulos right were particularly influential in july 2016 bannon claimed that breitbart had become the platform for the alt right 91 108 93 91 109 93 he may have been referring not to the website s official content but to its comments section which is lightly moderated and contains more extreme views than those of breitbart itself 91 110 93 several political scientists rejected the characterization of breitbart as alt right 91 111 93 although press sources repeatedly described it as such 91 112 93 91 113 93 91 114 93 and the journalist mike wendling termed breitbart the chief popular media amplifier of alt right ideas 91 115 93 in march 2016 the writers allum bokhari and milo yiannopoulos published an article in breitbart discussing the alt right 91 116 93 they downplayed its most extreme elements and championed its counter cultural value 91 117 93 bokhari and yiannopoulos piece was subsequently widely cited in the mainstream press 91 118 93 with hawley describing it as the most sympathetic portrayal of the movement to appear in a major media venue to date 91 119 93 many alt rightists responded negatively to bokhari and yiannopoulos article the daily stormer referred to it as the product of a degenerate homosexual and an ethnic mongrel 91 120 93 many press sources subsequently termed yiannopoulos alt right 91 121 93 91 122 93 this was rejected both by hawley 91 123 93 and by alt rightists on occidental dissent griffin asked what the hell does milo yiannopoulos a jewish homosexual who boasts about carrying on interracial relationships with black men have to do with us 91 124 93 other observers instead labeled yiannopoulos alt light or alt lite 91 125 93 a term also applied to rightists like mike cernovich and gavin mcinnes 91 126 93 mcinnes clarified his understanding of the difference between the alt right and alt lite by explaining that while the former focused on the white race the latter welcomed individuals of any racial background who shared its belief in the superiority of western culture 91 127 93 donald trump 2016 presidential campaign and election the alt right largely rallied behind the presidential candidacy of donald trump although he distanced himself from the movement in june 2015 billionaire businessman donald trump announced plans to campaign to become the republican nominee for the 2016 presidential election attracting the interest of alt rightists as well as from white nationalists more broadly neo nazis kkk groups and the patriot movement 91 128 93 vocal in their support for trump s campaign 91 129 93 91 130 93 91 131 93 91 132 93 this cause energized the alt right and gave them the opportunity for a broader audience 91 133 93 niewert observed that trump was the gateway drug for the alt right with many individuals learning of the movement through their interest in trump 91 134 93 ideologically the alt right remained far to trump s right 91 135 93 and trump himself had little understanding of the movement 91 133 93 many alt rightists recognized that trump did not share their white nationalism and would not bring about all the changes they desired 91 136 93 they nevertheless approved of his hard attitude to immigration his calls for a ban on muslims entering the u s and for a wall to be built along the border with mexico to curtail illegal immigration 91 137 93 they were grateful that he had shifted the national conversation rightward 91 138 93 and that he had shown that it was possible to challenge the mainstream conservative movement from the right 91 135 93 griffin called on alt rightists to join the trump campaign to take down the hated cuckservative establishment 91 139 93 91 note 2 93 a small minority of alt rightists were against supporting trump the right stuff contributor auschwitz soccer ref complained that two of trump s children had married jews 91 140 93 a keen twitter user in november 2015 trump retweeted a graphic about african american crime statistics which included the white nationalist hashtag whitegenocide 91 141 93 91 142 93 the alt righter ramzpaul rejoiced retweeting trump s piece with the comment trump watches and is influenced by the alt right 91 143 93 over coming months trump retweeted a second tweet that had whitegenocide as a hashtag as well as sharing other tweets issued by white supremacists 91 144 93 91 145 93 the alt right saw this as further evidence that trump was their champion 91 144 93 hillary clinton s august 2016 speech denouncing the alt right helped bring the movement to mainstream attention in august 2016 trump appointed bannon to lead his election campaign 91 146 93 91 108 93 91 147 93 this was swiftly condemned in a reno nevada speech given by the democratic party s nominee for the presidency hillary clinton 91 148 93 she highlighted bannon s claim that breitbart was the platform for the alt right 91 108 93 describing the movement as an emerging racist ideology and warning that a fringe element has effectively taken over the republican party 91 149 93 91 150 93 91 151 93 attacking the alt right as racist ideas anti muslim anti immigrant anti women ideas she accused trump of taking them mainstream 91 152 93 clinton said that while half of trump s supporters were decent individuals desperate for change the other half represented a basket of deplorables 91 153 93 after clinton s speech traffic to alt right websites rose and the mainstream media gave it increasing coverage 91 154 93 spencer and other alt rightists were pleased believing her speech gave them greater publicity and helped legitimize them in the public eye 91 155 93 91 156 93 many trump supporters adopted the moniker of deplorables and the term was widely used on memes that the alt right promoted online 91 157 93 in september spencer taylor and peter brimelow held a press conference in washington dc to explain their goals 91 158 93 91 159 93 when trump won the election in november the alt right s response was generally triumphalist and self congratulatory 91 160 93 anglin stated make no mistake about it we did this if it were not for us it wouldn t have been possible spencer tweeted that the alt right has been declared the winner we re the establishment now 91 161 93 91 162 93 alt rightists were generally supportive of trump s decision to appoint bannon his chief strategist 91 163 93 91 164 93 and jeff sessions his attorney general 91 165 93 91 166 93 while aware that trump would not pursue a white nationalist agenda the alt right hoped to pull him further to the right taking hardline positions that made him look more moderate and thus shifting mainstream discourse rightward 91 124 93 after trump s election wendling suggested that trump s election signaled the beginning of the end for the alt right 91 167 93 with the movement s growth stalling from that point 91 133 93 celebrating trump s victory spencer held a november meeting in washington d c in which he stated that he thought that he had a psychic connection a deeper connection with donald trump in a way we simply do not have with most republicans 91 168 93 he ended the conference by declaring hail trump hail our people hail victory to which various attendees responded with nazi salutes and chanting this attracted significant press attention when questioned on the incident spencer stated that the salutes were given in a spirit of irony and exuberance 91 169 93 91 170 93 91 171 93 later that month trump was asked about the alt right in an interview with the new york times he responded i don t want to energize the group and i disavow the group 91 172 93 91 173 93 this rejection angered many alt rightists 91 174 93 in april 2017 many alt rightists criticized trump s order to launch the shayrat missile strike against syrian military targets like many of those who had supported him they believed he was going back on his promise of a more non interventionist foreign policy in the middle east 91 175 93 91 176 93 91 177 93 91 178 93 hawley noted that the alt right s influence on the trump administration was negligible 91 179 93 however press sources alleged that several appointments within the trump administration were linked to the alt right including senior advisor to the president stephen miller 91 180 93 national security advisor michael flynn 91 181 93 deputy assistant to the president sebastian gorka 91 182 93 special assistant to the president julia hahn 91 183 93 and speechwriter darren beattie 91 184 93 after trump s election the alt right also supported the unsuccessful campaigns of several other republicans including roy moore 91 185 93 some republican candidates who were alleged to have alt right links also ran for office among them paul nehlen 91 186 93 corey stewart 91 187 93 91 188 93 josh mandel and joe arpaio 91 189 93 91 190 93 in 2016 twitter began closing alt right accounts it regarded as engaging in abuse or harassment 91 191 93 among those closed were the accounts of spencer and his npi 91 192 93 in february 2017 reddit then closed down the r altright subreddit after its participants were found to have breached its policy prohibiting doxing 91 193 93 91 194 93 91 195 93 facebook followed by shutting down spencer s pages on its platform in april 2018 91 196 93 in january 2017 spencer launched a new website altright com which combined the efforts of the arktos publishing company and the red ice video and radio network 91 197 93 91 198 93 unite the right rally and its aftermath further information charlottesville car attack a participant at the unite the right rally gave a nazi salute and was subsequently assaulted by counter protesters in august 2017 the unite the right rally took place in charlottesville virginia bringing together alt rightists with members of other far right movements 91 199 93 many alt rightists thought that the rally would mark a turning point in the transformation of their movement from an online phenomenon into a street based one 91 199 93 at altright com editor vincent law for instance predicted before the event took place that people will talk about charlottesville as a turning point 91 199 93 91 200 93 however the event and its aftermath proved demoralizing for many in the movement 91 201 93 various violent acts took place at the rally an african american man deandre harris was assaulted by demonstrators while richard w preston an imperial wizard for the maryland based confederate white knights of the ku klux klan fired a gun towards counter protesters 91 202 93 91 203 93 one participant in the rally a 20 year old from ohio named james alex fields jr rammed his car into counter protesters killing 32 year old heather d heyer and injuring 35 others 91 204 93 91 205 93 91 206 93 although spencer condemned the killing other alt rightists celebrated it 91 207 93 fields was arrested and later sentenced to life in prison 91 208 93 91 209 93 the car ramming incident brought much negative publicity to the event and its participants 91 210 93 earning the alt right a reputation for violence 91 211 93 video of the charlottesville car attack which killed one person and injured 35 various commentators and politicians including sessions labelled fields ramming attack domestic terrorism 91 212 93 91 213 93 91 214 93 trump claimed that there were some very fine people on both sides of the charlottesville protests stating that what he called the alt left bore some responsibility for the violence spencer stated that he was really proud of the president for those comments 91 215 93 amid criticism of his comments trump added his view that racism is evil and that those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs 91 216 93 various alt rightists who attended the rally experienced personal and legal repercussions for their involvement 91 217 93 one attendee the u s marine vasillios pistolis was for instance court martialled 91 218 93 internet service providers and social media websites subsequently terminated many alt right accounts and sites 91 217 93 prominent figures like spencer became reticent about organizing further public protests 91 201 93 he experimented with the use of flash demonstrations returning to charlottesville with a much smaller group for an unannounced protest in october 91 78 93 91 219 93 unite the right exacerbated tensions between the alt right and the alt lite 91 220 93 breitbart distanced itself from the alt right 91 221 93 as did yiannopoulos who insisted he had nothing in common with spencer 91 222 93 2017 present decline the alt right significantly declined in 2017 and 2018 this has happened for multiple reasons including the backlash of the unite the right rally the fracturing of the movement more effective banishment of hate speech and harassment from major social media websites and widespread opposition by the american population 91 223 93 in 2018 heidi beirich of the southern poverty law center described it as imploding while marilyn mayo of the anti defamation league stated that the alt right was in a downward spiral but it doesn t mean they re going to disappear 91 224 93 that year heimbach was arrested for the battery of his wife and father in law resulting in the dissolution of his traditionalist workers party 91 225 93 91 224 93 while anglin went into hiding to avoid a harassment lawsuit and spencer canceled his speaking tour 91 224 93 writing for the guardian jason wilson stated that the alt right looks like it is crumbling 91 226 93 there has been widespread concern that as the chance of a large scale political movement dies out lone wolf terrorist attacks from members will become common 91 223 93 in 2017 terrorist attacks and violence affiliated with the alt right and white supremacy were the leading cause of extremist violence in the united states 91 227 93 91 228 93 zack beauchamp of vox suggested that other more nakedly violent far right movements have risen in its wake 91 229 93 several alt right candidates ran as republican candidates in the 2018 elections the neo nazi and holocaust denier arthur jones ran for an illinois congressional seat the white supremacist paul nehlen for the wisconsin seat of paul ryan the republican speaker of the house 91 230 93 and the neo nazi patrick little for the united states senate election in california 2018 91 231 93 91 232 93 dissident right is a term used by some groups within the alt right to make white nationalism appear more mainstream or fun 91 233 93 91 234 93 during october and november 2019 turning point usa s culture war college tour was frequently targeted by the dissident right led by nick fuentes who consider some groups to be not sufficiently conservative on issues of race and ethnicity immigration and lgbtq rights 91 235 93 beliefs the alt right is situated on the far right of the left right political spectrum 91 236 93 it has no unifying manifesto and those who describe themselves as alt rightists express varying views about what they want to achieve 91 237 93 there are nevertheless recurring attitudes within the movement 91 237 93 the alt right s views are profoundly anti egalitarian 91 238 93 it rejects many of the basic premises of the age of enlightenment and classical liberalism 91 239 93 including the liberal democracy which underpins the u s political system 91 240 93 for this reason hawley thought that the alt right seems like a poor fit for the united states where both the left and right have roots in classical liberalism and the enlightenment 91 241 93 similarly the academic thomas j main stated that the alt right sought a root and branch rejection of american political principles 91 242 93 the key division within the alt right is between those who embrace explicitly neo nazi and white supremacist stances and those white nationalists who present a more moderate image 91 243 93 wendling suggested that this was a distinction lacking a hugely significant difference 91 244 93 the white supremacist and neo nazi alt rightists are sometimes termed 1488s a combination of the white supremacist fourteen words slogan with 88 a coded reference to hh or heil hitler 91 245 93 these neo nazi elements represent a minority within the alt right 91 246 93 many on the less extreme end of the movement are critical of them believing that they go too far or generate bad publicity for it 91 247 93 some of the latter mock the neo nazi and explicitly white supremacist elements as stormfags a reference to the white supremacist website stormfront 91 248 93 white nationalism the alt right is a white nationalist movement and is fundamentally concerned with white identity 91 249 93 91 2 93 it views all political issues through the framework of race 91 250 93 spencer described the alt right as identity politics for white americans and for europeans around the world 91 251 93 while the alt rightist greg johnson of countercurrents publishing stated that the alternative right means white nationalism 91 252 93 not all alt rightists actively embrace the term white nationalist 91 237 93 spencer is among those who prefer to call themselves identitarians 91 207 93 main described the alt right as promoting white racialism 91 240 93 while hawley commented that the alt right is at its core a racist movement 91 13 93 similarly historian david atkinson stated that the alt right was a racist movement steeped in white supremacist ideas 91 78 93 attitudes to non white people vary within the alt right from those who desire tighter restrictions on non white immigration into the u s to those who call for a violent ethnic cleansing of the country 91 253 93 protestors at the 2017 unite the right rally which was promoted by the alt right one man carries the logo of vanguard america and another has a t shirt depicting german nazi leader adolf hitler rejecting the idea that race is a socio cultural construct the alt right promotes scientific racism claiming that racial categories demarcate biologically distinct groups they call this belief race realism 91 254 93 a recurring tendency among alt rightists is to rank these races on a hierarchy according to perceived iq this hierarchy has asians and ashkenazi jews at the top followed by non jewish whites then arabs and finally black africans 91 255 93 several prominent alt rightists including anglin and spencer have been romantically involved with women of asian heritage 91 256 93 unlike earlier racist worldviews such as those of the interwar fascists the alt right emphasizes the idea of racial difference above that of racial superiority leaving the latter either implicit or secondary in its discourse 91 257 93 most alt rightists reject the label of white supremacist 91 248 93 having analyzed alt right posts online the political scientists joe phillips and joseph yi noted that a pervasive underlying theme was the belief that white people were victims and that white americans had been disadvantaged by government policies such as affirmative action for non white groups assistance to illegal immigrants and the perceived denigration of white history like christopher columbus and the confederate states of america 91 248 93 alt right online discourse also expressed much anger at the idea of white privilege widely promoted by the american left in the 2010s with members citing job insecurity under employment or unemployment and growing mortality rates among whites as evidence that they do not lead privileged lives 91 248 93 many alt rightists have expressed the desire to push white nationalist ideas into the overton window the range of ideas tolerated in public discourse 91 258 93 the alt right has served as a bridge between white nationalism and traditional conservatism and as a tool used by white nationalists to push their rhetoric into the mainstream 91 259 93 on twitter alt rightists for instance combined their white nationalist hashtags with others used by trump supporters more broadly notably makeamericagreatagain so as to spread their message across the broader political right 91 260 93 white separatism and ethno states the alt right is typically white separatist with its members desiring autonomy in their own white communities 91 261 93 some envision breaking up the united states into multiple states each inhabited by a different ethnic or racial group 91 261 93 one or more of which would represent white ethno states 91 250 93 writing in the pacific standard journalist jared keller commented that this desire for an independent ethno state was similar to anarcho fascist ideas promoted by the british national anarchist movement 91 262 93 spencer compared his campaign for a white ethno state with the early days of zionism which began in the 19th century with calls for the formation of a jewish ethno state and resulted in the formation of israel in the mid 20th century 91 263 93 many alt rightists are unclear as to how a white ethno state would emerge but are content instead to promote the idea 91 264 93 spencer commented i don t know how we re going to get there because the thing is history will decide that for us you have to wait for a revolutionary opportunity to present itself and history will present that opportunity 91 263 93 he suggested that it could be achieved through peaceful ethnic cleansing with non whites given financial incentives to leave 91 265 93 the prominent alt rightist greg johnson suggested that it would come about after white nationalists became the dominant force in u s politics at which point they would deport all illegal migrants before encouraging all other people of color to emigrate 91 253 93 other alt rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the u s into ethno states arguing that this would mean destroying the country that their euro american ancestors built 91 261 93 they instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the u s retains its white majority 91 266 93 some alt rightists promote a pan white empire spanning europe and north america 91 267 93 spencer noted that wanted his white ethno state in north america to eventually form part of a global empire that could provide a homeland for all white people expanding its territory into the middle east by conquering istanbul which in his words was such a profoundly symbolic city retaking it that would be a statement to the world 91 268 93 antisemitism and the white genocide conspiracy theory footage of right wing protesters at the unite the right rally chanting you will not replace us some elements of the alt right are antisemitic but others are tolerant of jews 91 269 93 91 7 93 many in the alt right believe that there is a jewish conspiracy within the united states to achieve white genocide the elimination of white people as a racial group and their replacement with non whites 91 270 93 they believe that a jewish cabal controls the u s government media and universities and is pursuing its aim of white genocide by spreading anti white tropes and encouraging african american civil rights groups 91 201 93 as evidence for this supposed white genocide these far right figures point to the depiction of inter racial couples or mixed race children on television and the publication of articles discouraging women from having children early in life 91 271 93 they also cite apparent instances of white self hatred including rachel dolezal an american woman of european descent who identifies as black 91 272 93 this antisemitic conspiracy theory is not new to the alt right but has recurred among far right groups in western countries since the 19th century it was the reason for the holocaust and various anti semitic pogroms in european history 91 201 93 andrew anglin one of the most prominent alt right ideologues and a member of its neo nazi wing stated the core concept of the movement upon which all else is based is that whites are undergoing an extermination via mass immigration into white countries which was enabled by a corrosive liberal ideology of white self hatred and that the jews are at the center of this agenda 91 273 93 anglin stated that in the alt right many people also believe that the jews should be exterminated 91 274 93 91 275 93 91 276 93 other alt rightists like spencer welcome the involvement of jews within their movement 91 277 93 opposition to neoconservatism and political correctness the alt right sought to hasten the downfall of u s conservatism 91 278 93 and conservatives were often the main target of alt right wrath 91 279 93 the prominent alt right ideologue brad griffin stated alt right is presenting itself as a sleek new challenger to mainstream conservatism and libertarianism alt right was designed to appeal to a younger audience who reject the left but who don t fit in on the stuffy or banal right either 91 280 93 the alt right places little emphasis on economic issues 91 281 93 unlike mainstream u s conservatives alt rightists do not tend to favor laissez faire economics and most appear to support president trump s protectionist economic measures 91 282 93 the alt right also rejects what it regards as the left wing dominance of modern western society 91 16 93 phillips and yi noted that alongside white identity politics the alt right promotes a message of expressive transgression against left wing orthodoxy political correctness 91 283 93 political correctness has been characterized as one of the alt right s bugbears 91 284 93 nicole hemmer stated on npr that political correctness is seen by the alt right as the greatest threat to their liberty 91 285 93 alt rightists often employ the term cultural marxism originally coined in reference to a specific form of marxist thought popularised among the u s right wing in the 1990s in reference to a perceived leftist conspiracy to alter society they apply the term cultural marxism to a broad range of left movements 91 286 93 governance isolationism and anti interventionism the russian far right theorist aleksandr dugin was popular with the alt right anglin claimed that the goal of the alt right was to form an authoritarian government 91 274 93 91 275 93 91 276 93 writing in the new yorker the journalist andrew marantz claimed that neo monarchists were among the alt right 91 287 93 the alt right has no specific platform on u s foreign policy 91 288 93 although it has been characterized as being non interventionist 91 289 93 as well as isolationist 91 290 93 generally it opposes established republican party views on foreign policy issues 91 288 93 alt rightists typically opposed president bush s war on terror policies 91 288 93 and spoke against the 2017 shayrat missile strike 91 289 93 91 290 93 the alt right has no interest in spreading democracy abroad and opposes the united states close relationship with israel 91 288 93 the alt right often looks favorably on russian president vladimir putin viewing him as a strong nationalistic white leader who defends his country from both radical islam and western liberalism 91 291 93 spencer praised putin s russia as the most powerful white power in the world 91 59 93 while prominent alt rightist matthew heimbach called putin the leader of the free world 91 292 93 although during the cold war the american right often presented the soviet union as the main threat to the u s links between the american far right and russia grew during the 2000s when prominent far right activists like david duke visited the country the latter described russia as being key to white survival 91 293 93 the far right russian political theorist aleksandr dugin is also viewed positively by the alt right 91 294 93 91 295 93 dugin has written for spencer s websites 91 99 93 and spencer s estranged wife the ethnically russian nina kouprianova has translated some of dugin s work into english 91 296 93 many alt rightists also regard syrian president bashar al assad as a heroic figure for standing up to rebel groups in the syrian civil war 91 297 93 heimbach has endorsed a shi ite axis between al assad s syria iran and hezbollah in lebanon seeing them as allies in the global struggle against zionism 91 292 93 anti feminism and misogyny favoring a more patriarchal society the alt right is anti feminist 91 298 93 unlike many u s conservatives the alt right does not argue its anti feminist position from traditional christian perspectives but claims that it is rooted in what it calls sex realism arguing that as a result of their biological differences men and women are suited to different tasks in society 91 288 93 lyons commented that the alt right was misogynistic and presented women as irrational and vindictive 91 299 93 although a minority in the movement the alt right has female members who support its anti feminist stance 91 300 93 91 301 93 91 302 93 some prominent alt right women such as lauren southern have experienced harassment and abuse from within the movement 91 301 93 91 300 93 the daily stormer for instance banned female contributors and called for reduced female involvement in the white nationalist movement producing an angry response from various white nationalist women 91 299 93 within feminist circles the alt right s desired future was repeatedly compared to the republic of gilead the fictional dystopia in margaret atwood s the handmaid s tale 1985 and its 2017 television adaptation 91 303 93 a placard criticizing the alt right displayed at the 2017 women s march the alt right intersects with the manosphere an online anti feminist subculture 91 304 93 including the men s rights movement which believes that men face more oppression in western society than women 91 288 93 it adopts the movement s view that feminism has undermined and emasculated men and believes that men should aggressively reassert their masculinity so as not to become beta males or cucks 91 254 93 there has been some clear influence between the two movements prominent manosphere ideologue roosh v for instance attended an npi conference and quoted anti semitic material from white nationalist sources in his articles 91 305 93 some alt right figures have distanced themselves from the manosphere and its proponents greg johnson of counter currents publishing was of the view that the manosphere morally corrupts men because it does not promote the resurgence of traditional and biologically based sexual norms 91 306 93 the alt right displays far less interest in homosexuality and abortion than the u s conservative movement with alt rightists taking varying perspectives on these topics 91 307 93 hawley suggested that the alt right was more broadly sympathetic to legal abortion access than the conservative movement 91 308 93 many alt rightists support abortion access because of its disproportionate use by african american and hispanic american women 91 308 93 some on the alt right consider homosexuality to be immoral and a threat to the survival of the white race 91 309 93 with alt right trolls having employed homophobic terminology like faggot 91 310 93 others adopt a more tolerant stance and have praised gay white nationalists 91 311 93 this reflects a broader trend among white nationalists to denigrate gay culture while being more tolerant of gay writers and musicians whose views they sympathize with like james o meara and douglas pearce 91 309 93 religion the alt right is broadly secular 91 312 93 many of its members are atheists 91 313 93 91 314 93 or highly skeptical of organized religion 91 315 93 and god 91 314 93 some alt rightists identify as christians 91 316 93 the right stuff for instance hosted an alt right christian podcast called the godcast 91 317 93 there are also individuals in the movement who do not believe in christian teachings but identify as cultural christians admiring the christian heritage of western society 91 313 93 others on the alt right oppose christianity entirely criticizing it for its jewish roots for being a universal religion that seeks to cross racial boundaries and for encouraging what they see as a slave morality that they contrast with perceived ancient aristocratic values 91 318 93 some elements pursue modern paganism 91 313 93 91 319 93 white evangelical leaders of the southern baptist church have angered the alt right by expressing support for refugees entering the u s calling for measures to help undocumented migrants gain legal status and urging members not to display the confederate battle flag 91 320 93 despite this alt right hostility to christianity has waned over time with many alt right commentators identifying as christian while rejecting mainstream christian politics and most mainstream christian religious leaders especially pope francis 91 321 93 the mormon related hashtag deznat which targets pornography the lgbtq community mormon apostates and progressives sometimes violently see blood atonement has also been linked to the alt right 91 322 93 several press sources have linked the alt right to islamophobia 91 18 93 91 323 93 91 324 93 and wendling stated that alt rightists view islam as a fundamental threat to western society 91 313 93 hawley expressed the view that ironically people on the alt right are less islamophobic than many mainstream conservatives 91 325 93 he observed that many u s conservatives criticized muslim migration to the united states because they regarded islam as a threat to liberty the alt right has made little use of this argument for alt rightists migration from islamic majority countries is undesirable not because the migrants are muslims but because most of them are non white it is equally opposed to non white migrants who are christian or non religious 91 326 93 structure alt right groups live recruit and coordinate and hence evolve online and from what we can already see they do so pretty much exactly like the pro isis groups evolve and coordinate but facebook has so far been less quick to shut them down 8211 neil johnson extremist researcher 91 327 93 the academic timothy j main characterized it as an ideological movement interested more in spreading its ideas rather than operating as a social movement or political party 91 328 93 while according to hawley the alt right was a disorganized mob that broadly shares a number of goals and beliefs 91 329 93 the alt right is not an organized movement and has no formal institutions or leading elite 91 330 93 it is a predominantly online phenomenon 91 331 93 lacking print newspapers and has little radio or television presence 91 332 93 it had no think tanks that influenced government policy and could not command the open allegiance of any major politicians or mainstream pundits 91 332 93 unlike many counter cultural movements it lacked soft power in the form of original bands songs films and other cultural artifacts of which it produced very few 91 333 93 according to hawley it was the movement s success in using the internet that allowed it to punch above its weight in the political arena 91 75 93 the alt right made use of a large number of blogs podcasts forums and webzines in which it discussed far right political and cultural ideas 91 75 93 the use of the internet by the far right was not pioneered by the alt right the white supremacist web forum stormfront had for instance been active since 1996 91 334 93 where the alt right differed was in its members willingness to leave far right websites and engage in trolling on other parts of the internet such as the comments sections of major news websites as well as popular social media applications such as youtube and twitter 91 334 93 according to hawley it was the alt right s use of trolling which put it into the national conversation 91 75 93 the movement s online structure had strengths in that it allowed members to say things anonymously online that they would not be willing to say on the street or any other public place 91 33 93 the lack of any formal organization also meant that nobody could be kicked out of the alt right 91 33 93 as the alt right developed a number of formal real world events were held particularly through the national policy institute 91 334 93 members of the alt right have also attended events organized by an older far right white nationalist group american renaissance 91 334 93 these events have gained a more limited audience than the alt right s online activities 91 334 93 this may be because operating online allows members of the alt right to operate anonymously while to attend events they must often expose themselves to journalists and protesters thus making it more likely that their views will become publicly known 91 334 93 u s alt rightists have also sought to build links with other far right and white nationalist groups elsewhere in the world heimbach for instance addressed meetings of the golden dawn in greece and the national democratic party of germany 91 292 93 various u s based alt rightists used social media to encourage support for the alternative for germany party in that country s 2017 federal election 91 335 93 the scholar sitara thobani argued for a convergence between the u s alt right and hindu nationalism in india 91 336 93 tactics main argued that a characteristic of the alt right was its use of vitriolic language including race baiting coarse ethnic humor prejudicial stereotyping vituperative criticism and the flaunting of extremist symbols 91 240 93 in the new yorker the journalist benjamin wallace wells noted that the alt right sought to test the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics of what can be said and how directly 91 129 93 members often made reference to freedom of speech when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse 91 337 93 alt rightists promoted their messages through twitter hashtags such as whitegenocide whitelivesmatter and standupforeurope 91 338 93 a recurrent tactic of alt rightists is to present themselves as white men as victims of oppression and prejudice this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents 91 339 93 the alt right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes 91 340 93 for instance the american singer taylor swift is often held up as an idealized example of aryan beauty 91 341 93 when describing their own conversion to the movement alt rightists refer to themselves as having been getting red pilled a reference to a scene in the 1999 film the matrix in which neo the protagonist chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill 91 342 93 on alt right blogs and message boards members often discuss how they were red pilled originally 91 343 93 members that encourage others to conceal their actual beliefs to more easily spread their messages refer to this tactic as hiding one s power levels in reference to a scene from the anime dragon ball z 91 344 93 91 345 93 alt rightists have also adopted milk as a symbol of their views various members have used the words heil milk in their online posts while spencer included an emoji of a glass of milk on his twitter profile along with the statement that he was very tolerant lactose tolerant 91 346 93 the animal studies scholar vasile st nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that northern europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products 91 347 93 use of humor and irony the alt right makes strong use of humor and irony 91 348 93 as noted by nagle the alt right s use of humor renders it difficult to tell what political views were genuinely held and what were merely as they used to say for the lulz 91 349 93 by presenting an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups the alt right was able to attract people who would be willing to visit its websites but who would not have considered attending neo nazi or kkk events 91 27 93 as noted by hawley whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter reactionary and antisocial much of the alt right comes across as youthful light hearted and jovial even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities 91 334 93 members of the alt right sometimes mocked the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as william pierce 91 350 93 another of the tactics employed online by alt rightists is to parody their leftist opponents one american alt rightist for instance created a twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an lgbtq pansexual nonbinary poc transwoman who was a journalist for blm black lives matter always stayin woke 91 351 93 alt rightists also orchestrated pranks again to cause alarm among opponents for instance during the 2016 presidential campaign alt rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout there was no such plot but press sources like politico presented these claims as fact 91 352 93 this tendency toward trolling rendered it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt right because any members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their own amusement 91 353 93 nagle argued that the alt right had inherited a transgressive style descending from the marquis de sade in the 18th century 91 354 93 but that with the alt right this the transgressive anti moral style reached its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or christian morality of the right 91 355 93 use of memes dindu nuffin redirects here for the song see dindu nuffin song the pepe the frog meme originally created in 2005 was adopted by the alt right and became a mascot for the movement 91 356 93 the alt right makes heavy use of memes 91 357 93 91 358 93 91 359 93 adopting much of its image and humor based culture including its heavy use of memes from the online subcultures active at 4chan and later 8chan 91 86 93 these memes are used to try and influence public opinion 91 360 93 the prevalence of such memes in alt right circles has led some commentators to question whether the alt right is a serious movement rather than just an alternative way to express traditionally conservative beliefs 91 358 93 91 129 93 with chava gourarie of the columbia journalism review stating that provoking a media reaction to these memes is for some creators an end in itself 91 8 93 one of the most commonly used memes within the alt right is pepe the frog 91 361 93 91 362 93 91 363 93 the pepe meme was created by artist matt furie in 2005 and over following years spread through the internet being shared by pop stars like nicki minaj and katy perry 91 364 93 by 2014 pepe was one of the most popular online memes used among far right trolls on 4chan and from there adopted by the alt right 91 365 93 after trump tweeted a meme of pepe as himself and his son donald trump jr posted a pepe meme shortly after alt righters and 4channers began spreading the meme with political intent 91 366 93 according to writer gary lachman pepe became the unofficial mascot of the alt right movement 91 366 93 the use of pepe spawned the satirical worship of the ancient egyptian frog headed deity kek as well as satirical nationalism of the nonexistent nation of kekistan 91 367 93 91 368 93 clown world a phrase used by the alt right to express their distaste towards societies perceived to be too liberal or multiracial is often used in conjunction with images of pepe dressed like a clown who they dub honkler 91 369 93 another alt right mascot was moon man an unofficial parody of mcdonald s 1980s mac tonight character 91 370 93 91 371 93 91 372 93 alt rightists posted videos to youtube in which moon man rapped to songs they had composed like black lives don t matter by a text to speech synthesizer 91 370 93 a young man displaying the flag of kekistan at a pro trump rally the flag is an alt right symbol the alt right used specific terms for individuals outside the movement whites who were not part of the movement were called normies 91 373 93 homosexuals and whites who socialized with people of color were referred to as degenerates 91 374 93 an alt right acronym was weird for western educated industrialised rich and democratic people 91 375 93 mainstream conservatives were denigrated as cuckservatives a portmanteau of cuckold and conservative 91 376 93 91 377 93 91 378 93 the term cuckold pertains to a man with an unfaithful wife the alt right saw this as analogous to the role of the u s conservative movement in assisting non whites in the u s 91 379 93 91 note 3 93 various terms were used for leftists those who expressed progressive views particularly online were characterized as social justice warriors sjws 91 381 93 individuals who expressed leftist opinions on tumblr and who alt rightists often stereotyped as fat ugly feminists were called tumblrinas 91 382 93 the term snowflake short for special snowflake was used as a pejorative for such individuals 91 383 93 and in reference to leftist uses of trigger warnings alt rightists expressed a desire to trigger leftists by upsetting them 91 382 93 leftists who professed victim status while harassing or bullying others were labeled crybullies 91 384 93 while leftists who were perceived to be stupid were labeled libtards a neologism of liberal and retard 91 385 93 npc derived from non player characters which are ubiquitous in video games is used to disparage opponents of the alt right by implying they are incapable of independent thought and can only mindlessly repeat the same arguments and accusations against the alt right 91 386 93 when referring to african americans alt rightists regularly employed the meme dindu nuffin a bastardization of didn t do nothing in reference to claims of innocence by arrested african americans on this basis alt rightists referred to black people as dindus 91 374 93 91 387 93 events involving black people were called chimpouts rhetorically linking them with chimpanzees 91 388 93 alt rightists also used memes to ironically support the black egyptian hypothesis often using stereotypical african american vernacular such as we wuz kangz n shieet we was kings and shit 91 387 93 following the murder of ahmaud arbery in 2020 jogger was adopted by some members as an euphemism for nigger in reference to how arbery was killed while jogging and because both words sounded similar 91 389 93 refugees were often referred to as rapefugees a reference to incidents like the 2015 16 new year s eve sexual assaults in germany in which non white refugees were reported to have sexually assaulted white women 91 390 93 another meme the alt right employed was to place triple parentheses around jewish names this started at the right stuff to highlight the presence of jewish americans in the media and academia 91 391 93 91 392 93 91 387 93 one alt rightist created a google chrome plug in that would highlight jewish names online 91 393 93 alt rightists often utilized older white nationalist slogans such as the fourteen words we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children 91 394 93 that anti racist is a code for anti white 91 395 93 and that diversity is a code word for white genocide 91 396 93 from the latter alt rightists produced the hashtag reduction whitegenocide for use on twitter highway billboards and flyers 91 397 93 also used was the slogan it s ok to be white as a way of expressing a supposed reverse racism towards white people by minorities 91 398 93 the use of deus vult and various other crusader iconography was employed to express islamophobic sentiment 91 399 93 91 400 93 91 401 93 also apparent were helicopter ride memes which endorse documented cases of leftists being dropped from helicopters by chilean and argentine juntas similarly the term right wing death squad usually abbreviated as rwds also callbacks to the helicopter ride meme and to refer to far right fascist death squads 91 387 93 91 402 93 additional online features of the alt right included references to fashwave a neo fascist subgenre of electronic music microgenre vaporwave 91 403 93 91 404 93 harassment wendling noted that campaigns of abuse for political ends were a classic alt right tactic 91 405 93 while hawley called the alt right a subset of the larger internet troll culture 91 406 93 this trolling both contributed to creating racial discord and generated press attention for the movement 91 133 93 those most regularly targeted were jewish journalists mainstream conservative journalists and celebrities who publicly criticized trump 91 407 93 such harassment was usually spontaneous rather than pre planned but in various cases many alt right trolls piled on once the harassment had begun 91 408 93 after criticizing trump and the alt right the conservative journalist david a french who is white received much abuse referencing his white wife and adopted black daughter alt right trolls sent him images of his daughter in a gas chamber and repeatedly claimed that he liked to watch his wife have sex with black bucks 91 409 93 as a result of the pizzagate conspiracy theory the artist arrington de dionyso whose murals are frequently displayed at the comet ping pong pizzeria also experienced abuse from the alt right 91 410 93 91 411 93 in 2017 a wave of threats began being made to jewish community centers which some press sources attributed to the alt right 91 412 93 another jewish target was the conservative commentator ben shapiro who was sent messages stating that he and his children will go to the ovens 91 8 93 not all targets were u s citizens in what it called operation filthy jew bitch 91 413 93 the daily stormer encouraged its followers to send abuse to the british member of parliament mp luciana berger who is jewish images sent to her featured a yellow star on her head accompanied by the hashtag hitlerwasright 91 405 93 one uk based alt rightist was convicted for his involvement in the campaign 91 414 93 in another instance anglin commented on the june 2016 murder of the british mp jo cox by a far right activist by saying that jo cox was evil and she deserved to die her death was not a tragedy it was justice 91 415 93 while celebrating violence the daily stormer is cautious to remain on the legal side of u s incitement laws 91 415 93 demographics an attendee at the unite the right rally carrying a firearm and wearing a confederate battle flag t shirt the alt right s anonymized and decentralized nature makes it difficult to determine how many individuals are involved in it or the demographic attributes of this membership 91 416 93 the movement s members are concentrated in the united states but with participants present in other anglophone countries such as canada britain and australia as well as in parts of continental europe 91 417 93 while acknowledging that the u s was central to the alt right hermansson et al stressed that it was an international phenomenon 91 9 93 alt rightists have provided their own opinions on its numbers in 2016 anglin thought it had a cohesive constituency of between 4 million and 6 million people while griffin believed it had a core membership in the hundreds of thousands with a larger range of sympathizers 91 418 93 main determined that between september 2016 and february 2018 alt right websites received a combined average of 1 1 million unique visitors per month compared to 46 9 million unique visitors to broader right wing sites and 94 3 million for left wing sites 91 419 93 he deemed the size of the alt right to be miniscule 91 420 93 the alt right is majority male 91 421 93 91 300 93 although hawley suggested that about 20 of its support might be female 91 300 93 from the nature of the online discourse as well as the attendees of events organized by npi and american renaissance hawley believed that the majority of alt right participants are younger on average than the participants of most previous american far right groups 91 416 93 wendling believed that a large portion of the alt right were university students or recent graduates many bearing a particular grudge against the political correctness encountered on campus 91 417 93 the alt right ideologue greg johnson believed that the movement was attracting a higher percentage of better educated americans than prior white nationalist groups due to declining opportunities and standards of living for graduates during the 2010s 91 422 93 wendling also thought that alt rightists tried to position themselves as a cool posse of young intelligent kids but that this was misleading 91 423 93 he determined that many of those active on alt right forums were middle aged men from working class backgrounds 91 424 93 on interviewing young alt rightists hawley noted that many revealed that they embraced far right politics in response to the growing racial polarization of the obama era in particular the public debates around the shootings of trayvon martin and michael brown and the rise of the black lives matter movement 91 425 93 hawley suggested that many of these young people were willing to embrace the idea of dismantling the united states in favor of a new white ethno state because they had grown up in the u s during the post civil rights era in contrast he thought older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic american imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of u s history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated 91 426 93 the psychologists patrick s forscher and nour s kteily conducted a study of 447 self identified alt right members and found that they had higher rates of dark triad traits than non trump supporters 91 427 93 91 428 93 forscher and kteily also noted that the alt rightists psychological profiles bore similarities to those of trump supporters more broadly although displayed greater optimism about the economy a higher bias against black people and a higher rate of support for white collective action than other trump supporters 91 427 93 causal factors the political scientist philip w gray cited several reasons for the alt right s emergence in his analysis new online media had reduced the conservative movement s ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right while the growing distance of world war ii meant that pride in the u s victory over nazi germany and fascist italy provided less of a barrier to the american far right than it had when large numbers of people still remembered the conflict 91 429 93 gray also argued that the alt right was a reaction against the left wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s in particular the black lives matter movement and the popularization of concepts like white privilege and male privilege as well as events like the racial unrest in baltimore and ferguson and the shooting of police officers in dallas and baton rouge 91 430 93 the scholar of american studies annie kelly argued that the alt right was influenced by a pervasive discourse of anxiety about traditional white masculinity in mainstream u s culture in her view much of the groundwork for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the september 11 attacks in 2001 91 431 93 hawley concurred that some u s conservatives such as ann coulter had contributed to the alt right s rise through their attacks on political correctness as part of which they had effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism 91 432 93 some conservatives like columnist matt k lewis have agreed with this assessment 91 433 93 drawing comparisons with the tale of the boy who cried wolf the commentator angela nagle also suggested that the hysterical liberal call out culture of the 2010s in which everyone from saccharine pop stars to justin trudeau was called a white supremacist and everyone who wasn t with her a sexist made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far right movement really emerged online 91 434 93 disagreeing with nagle s view that the alt right was primarily a response to the stupidity of marginal internet liberalism the anti fascist reporter jay firestone who had spent three months undercover in new york s alt right community instead argued that it was a response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless dead end jobs 91 435 93 links to violence and terrorism the sprawling networks the alt right has built around its poisonous racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate the white male grievance culture that the leaders of the alt right are incubating has already inspired more than 40 deaths and left more than 60 people injured and unfortunately the alt right seems likely to inspire more as it moves further into the real world its leaders continue to abdicate all responsibility for the violence their ideology inspires and are becoming increasingly recalcitrant in the face of widespread condemnation after a year 2017 of escalating alt right violence we are probably in for more the southern poverty law center 2018 91 436 93 in 2017 hawley noted that the alt right was not a violent movement but that this could potentially change 91 437 93 from their analysis of online discourse phillips and yi concluded that rather than violence most alt right members focus on discussing and peacefully advocating their values 91 261 93 they added that presenting the alt right as a violent revolutionary movement or equating all alt rightists with the 1488 scene which was a rhetorical tactic for progressives was an intellectual failure akin to treating all muslims or black nationalists as radicals and terrorists 91 261 93 conversely wending noted that there were individuals on the extreme end of the alt right willing to use violence 91 438 93 he stated that the culture of the alt right is breeding its own brand of terrorists socially isolated young men who are willing to kill 91 439 93 the alt right movement has been considered by some political researchers a terrorist movement and the process of alt right radicalization has been compared to islamic terrorism by political scientists and leaders 91 440 93 91 441 93 91 442 93 91 443 93 91 444 93 a paper on the subject stated that it clearly fell under an extremist movement saying that alt right adherents also expressed hostility that could be considered extremist they were quite willing to blatantly dehumanize both religious national outgroups and political opposition groups 91 445 93 violent incidents in february 2018 the southern poverty law center assembled a list of 13 violent incidents between 2014 and 2018 perpetrated by alt right influenced people in which 43 people died and 67 people were injured the perpetrators of these events were all male between the ages of 17 and 37 with an average age of just over 25 years old only three of them were over 30 all but one was american the other was canadian 91 436 93 dylann roof spent much time reading alt right websites before carrying out the 2015 charleston church shooting 91 446 93 however he took greater interest in older white nationalist writers and groups like the council of conservative citizens and the northwest front 91 447 93 in december 2017 the 21 year old william edward atchison shot dead two students at aztec high school in aztec new mexico before killing himself atchison s online activity had included posting pro hitler and pro trump thoughts on alt right websites like the daily stormer under such usernames as future mass shooter and adam lanza and joking about school shootings in particular the columbine high school massacre 91 448 93 91 449 93 an alt righter named taylor wilson who had attended the unite the right rally was charged with attempting a terror attack on an amtrak train in october 2017 it was reported that he held a business card from the american based neo nazi political party national socialist movement 91 450 93 in october 2018 robert bowers opened fire on a synagogue in pittsburgh killing 11 and injuring 6 he was a member of a fringe social network called gab where he posted a message indicating an immediate intent to harm just prior to the shooting bowers had a history of extreme antisemitic postings on gab 91 451 93 the website is a favorite of alt right users who are banned or suspended from other social networks 91 452 93 91 453 93 in august 2019 the self described alt right member james patrick reardon of new middleton ohio was arrested accused of threatening violence against local jewish communities an arsenal or weaponry was found in his home 91 454 93 91 455 93 various far right militant groups have been linked with the alt right the rise above movement ram based in southern california has been linked to various violent acts including participation in the unite the right rally according to oren segal director of the anti defamation league s center on extremism ram constituted an alt right street fighting club 91 456 93 several press sources also described the atomwaffen division a militant neo nazi group founded in the u s in 2013 as being part of the alt right 91 457 93 91 458 93 the group was responsible for five murders several of which were of other alleged group members 91 459 93 far right groups outside the u s have also been influenced by the alt right the stawell times news noted that antipodean resistance an australian neo nazi group had links to the alt right online subculture 91 460 93 the group which makes use of nazi symbols such as the swastika and the nazi salute has explicitly called for the legalization of the murder of jews 91 461 93 91 462 93 the group was initially involved in vandalism and organizing training camps although various commentators warned that it might turn to terrorism and should be proscribed 91 463 93 reactions hawley thought that because of its use of novel tactics not previously used by the far right the alt right represents something genuinely new on the american political scene 91 237 93 while main believed that the alt right represented the first new philosophical competitor in the west to the liberal democratic system since the fall of the soviet union 91 240 93 lyons stated that the alt right helped revitalize white nationalist and male supremacist politics in the united states 91 464 93 while according to niewert the alt right gave white nationalism a fresh new life rewired for the twenty first century 91 26 93 kelly noted that while it was important not to overstate the size of the alt right its success lay primarily in its dissemination of far right ideas and in making anti leftist rhetoric more acceptable in mainstream discourse 91 465 93 a december 2016 pew research center survey found 54 of u s adults had heard nothing at all about the alt right 28 had heard a little and 17 a lot 91 466 93 a poll by abc news and the washington post found that 10 of respondents supported the alt right to 50 who opposed it 91 258 93 an ipsos and reuters poll found 6 of respondents supported the movement 91 258 93 such polls indicate that while millions of americans are supportive of the alt right s message they remain a clear minority 91 258 93 trump s election precipitated the publication of various books on the alt right 91 467 93 in 2018 the documentary film alt right age of rage was released directed by adam bhala lough it included interviews with spencer and taylor as well as with anti fascist activists devoted to combatting the alt right 91 468 93 91 469 93 opposition to the alt right main article responses to the alt right trump is alt right with us anti trump protesters highlight what they regard as his links to the alt right and to historical fascism by dressing as hitler and mussolini the alt right presented a unique set of challenges to journalists progressives and conservatives 91 20 93 its opponents failed to agree on how to respond to it 91 470 93 with there being much discussion in u s public discourse on how to avoid its normalization 91 431 93 some opponents emphasized calling out tactics labeling the alt right with terms like racist sexist homophobic and white supremacist in the belief that doing so would scare people away from it 91 471 93 many commentators urged journalists not to refer to the alt right by its chosen name but rather with terms like neo nazi 91 11 93 in 2017 the associated press for instance advised journalists to avoid the term 91 472 93 the activist group stop normalizing developed the stop normalizing alt right chrome extension which changes the term alt right on webpages to white supremacy 91 473 93 91 474 93 91 475 93 some on the political right including yiannopoulos argued that the alt right s appeal would be diffused if society accepted many of its less extreme demands including curbing political correctness and ending mass immigration 91 470 93 commentators like the conservative david frum suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse then the alt right would no longer be able to monopolize them 91 476 93 commentators have also highlighted the theoretical commonalities between the white identity politics of the alt right and the forms of identity politics widely embraced on the american left in the 2010s 91 477 93 with yiannopoulos commenting that if the american left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization it would have to accept white identity politics as a permanent fixture of the political landscape 91 470 93 some opponents sought to undermine the alt right s stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it for instance by labelling angry alt rightists as snowflakes who were being triggered 91 478 93 anti fascists also adopted the alt right s use of pranks on several occasions they publicized meet ups to destroy confederate monuments or gravestones alt rightists mobilized to stop them only to find that no such anti fascist event was happening at all 91 479 93 counter protesters at the 2017 unite the right rally various opponents employed doxing publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt rightists many of whom had previously acted anonymously 91 480 93 this discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt right activities as they fear that being outed as alt rightists might result in job loss social ostracization or violence 91 481 93 from 2016 onward some anti fascists also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement 91 482 93 on trump s inauguration day for example a masked anti fascist punched spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters the footage was widely shared online 91 483 93 hawley noted that this tactic could be counter productive to the alt right s opponents as it reinforces the narrative that alt rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally protected right to free speech were being victimized 91 484 93 other commentators called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt right 91 485 93 if denied access to mainstream social media outlets the alt right would be restricted to far right websites like stormfront and thus isolated from those not already committed to its cause 91 486 93 many alt rightists concur that denying it access to social media would devastate its ability to proselytize 91 485 93 however it has also been suggested that such censorship could backfire and aid alt right recruitment as it would play into the alt right narrative that the establishment was marginalizing those campaigning for white interests 91 476 93 suppressing the alt right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future including leftist ones 91 193 93 phillips and yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt right speech reflected a growing authoritarian shift within the american left among whom limiting or preventing the public speech of white males was increasingly seen as an acceptable method for equalizing power relations between racial and gender groups 91 266 93 alt left in the 1990s a loose group of left wing online activists based on usenet groups referred to themselves as alternative left or alt left to distinguish their ideas from those of more mainstream leftist thought 91 53 93 ideas promoted by alt left activists at the time included universal basic income and anti work sentiment 91 53 93 the popularisation of the term alt right in the 2010s saw the increasing use of alt left to describe far left groups among the press sources that did so were fox news in december 2016 91 487 93 and vanity fair in march 2017 91 488 93 after the unite the right rally later that year trump commented that some counter protesters were part of the very very violent alt left 91 489 93 91 490 93 91 491 93 commentator brian dean believed that trump was essentially conflating the term alt left with anti fascist 91 53 93 responding to trump s use of the term various commentators criticised the use of alt left claiming that it was neither created nor adopted by leftists but had been designed by right wingers and or centrist liberals to smear left wing protesters by suggesting a false equivalence between the alt right and their opponents 91 53 93 91 492 93 91 493 93 91 494 93 91 495 93 91 496 93 the historian timothy d snyder stated that alt right is a term meant to provide a fresh label that would sound more attractive than nazi neo nazi white supremacist or white nationalist with alt left it s a different story there is no group that labels itself that way 91 497 93 see also politics portal alt right pipeline alternative media the alt right playbook blood and
