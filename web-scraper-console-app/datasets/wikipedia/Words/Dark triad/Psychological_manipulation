manipulate consciously but rather try to convince themselves of the invalidity of their own emotions lack of self control over impulsive and anti social behaviour leading to pre emptive or reactionary manipulation to maintain image george k simon edit according to psychology author george k simon successful psychological manipulation primarily involves the manipulator 91 14 93 concealing aggressive intentions and behaviors and being affable knowing the psychological vulnerabilities of the victim to determine which tactics are likely to be the most effective having a sufficient level of ruthlessness to have no qualms about causing harm to the victim if necessary techniques of manipulators may include techniques description lying by commission it is hard to tell if somebody is lying at the time they do it although often the truth may be apparent later when it is too late one way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that some personality types particularly psychopaths are experts at lying and cheating doing it frequently and often in subtle ways lying by omission this is a subtle form of lying by withholding a significant amount of the truth this technique is also used in propaganda denial manipulator refuses to admit that they have done something wrong rationalization an excuse made by the manipulator for inappropriate behavior rationalization is closely related to spin minimization this is a type of denial coupled with rationalization the manipulator asserts that their behavior is not as harmful or irresponsible as someone else was suggesting selective inattention or selective attention manipulator refuses to pay attention to anything that may distract from their agenda diversion manipulator not giving a straight answer to a straight question and instead being diversionary steering the conversation onto another topic evasion similar to diversion but giving irrelevant rambling or vague responses covert intimidation manipulator putting the victim onto the defensive by using veiled subtle indirect or implied threats guilt trip a special kind of intimidation tactic a manipulator suggests to the conscientious victim that they do not care enough are too selfish or have it too easy this can result in the victim feeling bad keeping them in a self doubting anxious and submissive position shaming manipulator uses sarcasm and put downs to increase fear and self doubt in the victim manipulators use this tactic to make others feel unworthy and therefore defer to them manipulators can make one feel ashamed for even daring to challenge them it is an effective way to foster a sense of inadequacy in the victim vilifying the victim this tactic is a powerful means of putting the victim on the defensive while simultaneously masking the aggressive intent of the manipulator while the manipulator falsely accuses the victim as being an abuser in response when the victim stands up for or defends themselves or their position playing the victim role manipulator portrays themself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else s behavior in order to gain pity sympathy or evoke compassion and thereby get something from another caring and conscientious people often cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation playing the servant role cloaking a self serving agenda in the guise of a service to a more noble cause seduction manipulator uses charm praise flattery or overtly supporting others in order to get them to lower their defenses and give their trust and loyalty to the manipulator they will also offer help with the intent to gain trust and access to an unsuspecting victim they have charmed projecting the blame blaming others manipulating scapegoats in often subtle hard to detect ways often the manipulator will project their own thinking onto the victim making the victim look like they have done something wrong manipulators will also claim that the victim is the one who is at fault for believing lies that they were conned into believing as if the victim forced the manipulator to be deceitful all blame except for the part that is used by the manipulator to accept false guilt is done in order to make the victim feel guilty about making healthy choices correct thinking and good behaviors it is frequently used as a means of psychological and emotional manipulation and control manipulators lie about lying only to re manipulate the original less believable story into a more acceptable truth that the victim will believe projecting lies as being the truth is another common method of control and manipulation manipulators may falsely accuse the victim of deserving to be treated that way they often claim that the victim is crazy or abusive especially when there is evidence against the manipulator feigning innocence manipulator tries to suggest that any harm done was unintentional or that they did not do something that they were accused of manipulator may put on a look of surprise or indignation this tactic makes the victim question their own judgment and possibly their own sanity feigning confusion manipulator tries to play dumb by pretending they do not know what the victim is talking about or is confused about an important issue brought to their attention the manipulator intentionally confuses the victim in order for the victim to doubt their own accuracy of perception often pointing out key elements that the manipulator intentionally included in case there is room for doubt sometimes manipulators will have used cohorts in advance to help back up their story brandishing anger manipulator uses anger to brandish sufficient emotional intensity and rage to shock the victim into submission the manipulator is not actually angry they just put on an act they just want what they want and get angry when denied controlled anger is often used as a manipulation tactic to avoid confrontation avoid telling the truth or to further hide intent there are often threats used by the manipulator of going to the police or falsely reporting abuses that the manipulator intentionally contrived to scare or intimidate the victim into submission blackmail and other threats of exposure are other forms of controlled anger and manipulation especially when the victim refuses initial requests or suggestions by the manipulator anger is also used as a defense so the manipulator can avoid telling truths at inconvenient times or circumstances anger is often used as a tool or defense to ward off inquiries or suspicion the victim becomes more focused on the anger instead of the manipulation tactic bandwagon effect manipulator comforts the victim into submission by claiming whether true or false that many people already have done something and the victim should as well such manipulation can be seen in peer pressure situations often occurring in scenarios where the manipulator attempts to influence the victim into trying drugs or other substances martin kantor edit kantor advises in his 2006 book the psychopathology of everyday life how antisocial personality disorder affects all of us that vulnerability to psychopathic manipulators involves being too 91 32 93 dependent dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no immature has impaired judgment and so tends to believe exaggerated advertising claims na ve cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world or takes it for granted that if there are any they will not be allowed to prey on others impressionable overly seduced by charmers trusting people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest they are more likely to commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials etc and less likely to question so called experts carelessness not giving sufficient amount of thought or attention to harm or errors lonely lonely people may accept any offer of human contact a psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price narcissistic narcissists are prone to falling for unmerited flattery impulsive make snap decisions altruistic the opposite of psychopathic too honest too fair too empathetic frugal cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason it is so cheap materialistic easy prey for loan sharks or get rich quick schemes greedy the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way masochistic lack self respect and so unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them they think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt the elderly the elderly can become fatigued and less
