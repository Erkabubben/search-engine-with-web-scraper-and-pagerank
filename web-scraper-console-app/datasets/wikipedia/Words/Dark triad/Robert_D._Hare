neighborhood of calgary 91 3 93 hare attended the university of alberta for a bachelor of arts degree which ended up more by default with an emphasis on psychology in 1959 he married averil hare whom he met in an abnormal psychology class and a year later their daughter cheryl was born 91 3 93 in 1960 hare completed a master of arts in psychology at the university of alberta he then moved to the usa to study for a phd program in psychophysiology at the university of oregon but due to his daughter falling ill the family returned to canada 91 4 93 hare then worked as the psychologist in the prison system in british columbia british columbia penitentiary for eight months an area in which he had no particular qualification or training indeed he would later recount in without conscience that some prisoners were able to manipulate him 91 5 93 hare then moved to london ontario where he completed his phd 1963 at the university of western ontario with a dissertation on the effects of punishment on behaviour 91 6 93 91 4 93 his research led him to the mask of sanity by american psychiatrist hervey m cleckley which played a pivotal role in the concept of psychopathy he applied and developed 91 7 93 91 3 93 hare then returned to vancouver british columbia working as a professor at the ubc s psychology department where he would stay for 30 years until retirement and undertaking research at the same prison he had previously worked in he concluded that the reason some prisoners seemed not to change their behavior in response to punishment was because they were psychopaths he recalls i happened to get into an area that nobody else was working in 91 4 93 hare has said of himself and his wife averil that family and the loss of family their daughter cheryl died from multiple sclerosis in 2003 91 8 93 91 9 93 defines an awful lot about who averil and i are 91 4 93 91 10 93 averil his wife is a researcher and prominent social worker in canada specializing in child abuse and child welfare in the 1970s he published psychopathy theory and research summarizing the state of the field and became internationally influential in reviving and shaping the concept hare retired in 2000 closing his psychopathy research lab at the university of british columbia 91 3 93 in 2010 he was awarded the canadian psychological association s donald o hebb award for distinguished contributions to psychology as a science 91 11 93 the same year he was named a member of the order of canada 91 12 93 research edit causes of psychopathy edit hare s research on the causes of psychopathy focused initially on whether such persons show abnormal patterns of anticipation or response such as low levels of anxiety or high impulsiveness to aversive stimuli punishments such as mild but painful electric shocks or pleasant stimuli rewards such as a slide of a naked body further following cleckley hare investigated whether the fundamental underlying pathology is a semantic affective deficit an inability to understand or experience the full emotional meaning of life events while establishing a range of idiosyncrasies in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions the research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy hare s contention that the pathology is likely due in large part to an inherited or hard wired deficit in cerebral brain function remains speculative 91 13 93 hare has defined sociopathy as a condition distinct from psychopathy caused by growing up in an antisocial or criminal subculture rather than being marked by a basic lack of social emotion or moral reasoning he has also regarded the dsm iv diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as separate to his concept of psychopathy as it did not list the same underlying personality traits he suggests that aspd would cover several times more people than psychopathy and that while the prevalence of sociopathy is not known it would likely cover considerably more people than aspd 91 14 93 assessment tools edit frustrated by a lack of agreed definitions or rating systems of psychopathy including at a ten day international north atlantic treaty organization nato conference in france in 1975 hare began developing a psychopathy checklist produced for initial circulation in 1980 the same year that the dsm changed its diagnosis of sociopathic personality to antisocial personality disorder it was based largely on the list of traits advanced by cleckley with whom hare corresponded over the years hare redrafted the checklist in 1985 following cleckley s death in 1984 renaming it the hare psychopathy checklist revised pcl r it was finalised as a first edition in 1991 when it was also made available to the criminal justice system which hare says he did despite concerns that it was not designed for use outside of controlled experimental research 91 15 93 it was updated with extra data in a 2nd edition in 2003 the pcl r was reviewed in buros mental measurements yearbook 1995 as being the state of the art both clinically and in research use in 2005 the buros mental measurements yearbook review listed the pcl r as a reliable and effective instrument for the measurement of psychopathy and is considered the gold standard for measurement of psychopathy however it is also criticised 91 16 93 hare has accused the dsm s aspd diagnosis of drifting from clinical tradition but his own checklist has been accused of in reality being closer to the concept of criminologists william and joan mccord than that of cleckley hare himself while noting his promotion of cleckley s work for four decades has distanced himself somewhat from cleckley s work 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 hare is also co author of derivatives of the pcl the psychopathy checklist screening version pcl sv 91 20 93 still requires a clinical interview and review of records by a trained clinician the p scan p for psychopathy a screening questionnaire for non clinicians to detect possible psychopathy the psychopathy checklist youth version pcl yv to assess youth and children exhibiting early signs of psychopathy and the antisocial process screening device originally the psychopathy screening device a questionnaire for parents staff to fill out on youth or in a version developed by others for youth to fill out as self report 91 21 93 hare is also a co author of the guidelines for a psychopathy treatment program he has also co developed the b scan questionnaires for people to rate psychopathy traits in others in the workplace 91 22 93 hare was involved in a controversy in 2010 in which he threatened legal action if a peer reviewed psychology article on the pcl was published that he claimed misrepresented his views the paper eventually was published after a three year delay 91 23 93 impact edit the hare psychopathy checklist revised is sometimes used as a standard instrument for researchers and clinicians especially in forensic settings such as prisons or high secure psychiatric units 91 3 93 the measures play an important role in recent risk for violence instruments the pcl r and pcl sv have been found to be strong predictors of recidivism violence and response to therapeutic intervention though some studies have attributed this largely to the inclusion in the measure of past offending history the ability of hare s concept of psychopathy to explain or predict crime has also been criticised for example by glenn d walters a long serving us forensic clinical psychologist and associate professor of criminal justice 91 24 93 popular science edit hare wrote a popular science bestseller published in 1993 titled without conscience the disturbing world of the psychopaths among us reissued 1999 91 25 93 he describes psychopaths as social predators while pointing out that most don t commit murder one philosophical review described it as having a high moral tone yet tending towards sensationalism and graphic anecdotes and as providing a useful summary of the assessment of psychopathy but ultimately avoiding the difficult questions regarding internal contradictions in the concept or how it should be classified 91 26 93 91 27 93 hare also co authored the bestselling snakes in suits when psychopaths go to work 2006 with organizational psychologist and human resources consultant paul babiak a portrayal of the disruptions caused when psychopaths enter the workplace the book focuses on what hare refers to as the successful psychopath who can be charming and socially skilled and therefore able to get by in the workplace this is by contrast with the type of psychopath whose lack of social skills or self control would cause them to rely on threats and coercion and who would probably not be able to hold down a job for long hare appeared in the 2003 4 award winning documentary film the corporation discussing whether his criteria for psychopathy could be said to apply to modern business as a legal personality appearing to conclude that many of them would apply by definition 91 28 93 however in a 2007 edition of snakes in suits hare contends that the filmmakers took his remarks out of context and that he does not believe most corporations would meet all the necessary criteria in practice 91 29 93 hare s views are recounted with some skepticism in the 2011 bestseller the psychopath test by british investigative journalist jon ronson to which hare has responded 91 30 93 91 31 93 hare served as a consultant for jacob m appel s mask of sanity 2017 a novel about a high functioning sociopath 91 32 93 see also
