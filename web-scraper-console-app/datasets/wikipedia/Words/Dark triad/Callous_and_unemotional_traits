are distinguished by a persistent pattern of behavior that reflects a disregard for others and also a lack of empathy and generally deficient affect the interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors may play a role in the expression of these traits as a conduct disorder cd while originally conceived as a means of measuring the affective features of psychopathy in children measures of cu have been validated in university samples and adults 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 a cu specifier has been included as a feature of conduct disorder in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm 5 and the eleventh edition of the international classification of diseases icd 11 91 4 93 contents 1 symptoms 1 1 core features 1 2 associated features 2

reading symptoms edit core features edit cu traits as measured by the inventory of callous unemotional traits icu are in three categories callous reflecting ruthlessness and cruel treatment or disregard for others uncaring passive disregard for others and lack of prosocial emotion and unemotional limited experience and expression of emotion 91 5 93 unemotional traits are uniquely elevated in cases reflecting primary psychopathy 91 3 93 dsm 5 s limited prosocial emotions specifier and attendant interview measure the clinical assessment of prosocial emotions cape lists the following characteristics lack of remorse or guilt shallow or deficient affect unemotionality callous lack of empathy unconcerned with performance at work or school lack of reaction to what would be a traumatic event associated features edit children with cu traits have distinct problems in emotional and behavioral regulation that distinguish them from other antisocial youth 91 6 93 and show more similarity to characteristics found in adult psychopathy 91 7 93 antisocial youth with cu traits tend to have a range of distinctive cognitive characteristics they are often less sensitive to punishment cues particularly when they are already keen for a reward 91 8 93 cu traits are positively related to good intellectual verbal skills 91 9 93 classification edit a cu specifier for conduct disorder was added to dsm 5 91 4 93 the addition with limited prosocial emotions to the conduct disorder diagnosis in dsm 5 is to classify a specific subgroup of antisocial youth with distinguishing antisocial behaviors and psychopathic traits 91 6 93 the provision of the cu specifier for cd youth is claimed to improve the diagnostic power treatment options and increase the understanding life course outcomes 91 6 93 a 2008 review concluded that cu did not have the required evidence base to be included as a new diagnosis in dsm 5 91 10 93 causes and pathophysiology edit neural mechanisms edit the fearlessness theory of cu traits suggests that low amounts of cortisol lead to underarousal causing impairments in fear processing a trait seen in cu individuals 91 11 93 hypoactivity in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in combination with cu traits seem to cause antisocial behavior even without external hardships 91 11 93 genetic edit twin studies have found cu traits to be highly heritable and not significantly related to environmental factors such as socioeconomic status school quality or parent quality 91 6 93 two twin studies suggested a significant genetic influence for cu with an estimated average amount of variation 42 5 in cu traits accounted for by genetic effects 91 6 93 a substantial proportion of this genetic variation occurred independent of other dimensions of psychopathy 91 6 93 children with conduct problems who also exhibit high levels of cu traits reflect a particularly high heritability rate of 0 81 as reflected in longitudinal research 91 8 93 a study on a large group of children found more than 60 heritability for callous unemotional traits and that conduct problems among children with these traits had a higher heritability than among children without these traits 91 12 93 91 13 93 the study also found slight sex differences boys 64 girls 49 in the affective interpersonal factor 91 13 93 similarly the impulsive antisocial factor was primarily influenced by genetic factors boys 46 girls 58 91 13 93 maltreatment and parenting play a role in the development of antisocial behavior and studies have been shown to prove this while callous unemotional traits are rooted in genetics environmental triggers are an important contributing factor for the development of antisocial behaviour in children with the genetic propensity 91 14 93 criticism edit primatologist frans de waal argues that evolutionary theory postulates that biological altruism in primates evolved for the return benefits it bears the performer 91 15 93 some evolutionary biologists therefore criticize the psychiatric model of callous unemotional traits cu on the grounds that cu is inconsistent with evolutionary continuity rather these biologists argue that if empathy had evolved through mammalian evolution beginning with empathy restricted to close relatives and extending over the course of evolution to include more distant relatives then empathy with other humans could be expected to be necessary but not sufficient for human empathy with nonhuman animals this evolutionary biology model of altruism and empathy thus contrasts with the psychiatric model of cu because the latter implies that cruelty to animals is a predictor of violence to other humans but not the other way around 91 16 93 91 17 93 diagnosis edit research has attempted to subtype youth with callous unemotional traits by distinguishing between those with childhood onset versus adolescent onset conduct disorder conduct disorder co morbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd or by the severity and type of aggression displayed 91 7 93 children with cu traits have more severe conduct disorder and respond to different management 91 4 93 the inventory of callous unemotional traits icu assesses three independent factors in cu traits uncaring callous and unemotional 91 18 93 the severity of cd has been studied in children rated high on cu traits 91 8 93 management edit cu traits are relatively stable though some studies suggest that they may decrease over time through effective treatment 91 6 93 early intervention is thought to be more effective because cu traits are thought to be more malleable early in life 91 19 93 parenting techniques edit parenting interventions are the most commonly used treatment for treating early onset antisocial behaviors and conduct disorder in children and quality parenting may be able to decrease the manifestation of cu traits 91 6 93 91 20 93 children with high cu traits are less responsive to time out and other punishment techniques than are healthy children as they are unperturbed by the threat of punishment and time out does not seem to bother them so their behavior does not improve 91 21 93 reward based disciplining techniques such as praise and reinforcement tend to have a greater effect than punishing techniques on children with high cu traits in reducing antisocial behavior 91 8 93 prognosis edit childhood onset cu shows a more aggressive and stable pattern of antisocial behavior with higher rates of cu traits as well as more severe temperamental and neuropsychological risk factors relative to their adolescent onset counterparts 91 22 93 children with combined cd and adhd are more likely to show features associated with psychopathy but only in those who have high rates of cu traits 91 23 93 in support of the idea of lifetime persistence of cu traits childhood onset delinquency has been more strongly associated with psychopathic traits than adolescent onset delinquency 91 24 93 a longitudinal twin study of children with cd showed that high or increasing levels of cu traits comorbid with cd presented with the most negative outcomes after twelve years in relationships with peers and family as well as emotional and behavioral problems as compared to those with low cu traits or cd alone 91 25 93 in addition adolescents with cu traits have shown higher likelihood to commit a violent crime within a two year period of their release from a correctional facility than those without cu traits 91 26 93 antisocial youth with cu traits tend to show less response to treatment 91 8 93 a systematic review found that cu traits were associated with poorer outcomes in family based interventions for conduct problems this suggests pre treatment data on cu traits is clinically informative in terms of the prognostic status of children and young people with cu traits 91 27 93 history edit due to the potential severity of antisocial and violent traits seen in adult psychopathy research has focused on identifying the associated traits in childhood in adult psychopathy individuals with primarily affective and interpersonal deficits show a distinct etiology 91 28 93 similarly different subtypes of aggressive and antisocial behaviors in youth may predict distinct problem behaviors and risk factors there have been a number of attempts to officially designate psychopathic like traits in antisocial youths based on the affective and interpersonal traits of psychopathy the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iii divided conduct disorder into four subtypes undersocialized aggressive undersocialized nonaggressive socialized aggressive and socialized nonaggressive in an attempt to recognize the existence of psychopathic traits in children 91 23 93 the distinction between socialized and undersocialized children was the most pertinent in distinguishing between psychopathic like youths according to these definitions undersocialized children exhibited characteristic behaviors of psychopathy including lack of empathy lack of affection and inappropriate social relationships dsm iii this differed from socialized individuals who were able to form healthy social attachments to others and whose aggressive and antisocial acts typically derived from engagement in a deviant social group e g youth gangs following the publication of dsm iii these distinctions prompted research but there were still issues with the terminology in diagnosing the core features of the undersocialized versus socialized subtype the word undersocialized was used in order to avoid the negative connotations of psychopathy but was commonly misinterpreted to mean that the child was not well socialized by parents or lacked a peer group also the operational definition failed to include dimensions that could reliably predict the affective and interpersonal deficits in psychopathic like youths due to these issues the american psychiatric association removed the undersocialized and socialized distinctions from the conduct disorder description in the dsm after the third edition the only subtypes that have been included in the manual since then relate to the time of onset childhood onset before age 10 adolescent onset absence of antisocial traits before age 10 and unspecified onset 91 22 93
