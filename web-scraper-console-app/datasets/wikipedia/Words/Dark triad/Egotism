characteristics edit egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one s imagined self or narcissism 160 indeed some would say by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism 91 3 93 egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves in a self promoting fashion and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a grandiose sense of their own importance 91 4 93 their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others 91 5 93 leaves them profoundly self promoting while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist s part to narcissistic rage at a sense of insult 91 6 93 egotism differs from both altruism 160 or behaviour motivated by the concern for others rather than for oneself 160 and from egoism the constant pursuit of one s self interest various forms of empirical egoism have been considered consistent with egotism but do not 160 which is also the case with egoism in general 160 necessitate having an inflated sense of self 91 7 93 development edit in developmental terms two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism 160 the one individual the other cultural with respect to the developing individual a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up 91 8 93 it is normal for an infant to have an inflated 160 almost a majestic 160 sense of egotism 91 9 93 the over evaluation of one s own ego 91 10 93 regularly appears in childish forms of love 160 in large part because the baby is to himself everything omnipotent to the best of their own knowledge 91 11 93 optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one s own place in the world 160 a lessening of the egotistical swollen head 91 12 93 less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self 91 13 93 robin skynner however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where your ego is still there but it s taking its proper limited place among all the other egos 91 14 93 however alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing individual egotism a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of post modern society 91 15 93 whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice 160 for nathaniel hawthorne egotism was a sort of diseased self contemplation 91 16 93 160 romanticism had already set in motion a countervailing current what richard eldridge described as a kind of cultural egotism substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition 91 17 93 the romantic idea of the self creating individual 160 of a self authorizing artistic egotism 91 18 93 160 then took on broader social dimensions in the following century keats might still attack wordsworth for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime 91 19 93 but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the me generation into the culture of narcissism in the 21st century romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno capitalism in two complementary ways 91 20 93 on the one hand through the self centred consumer focused on their own self fashioning through brand identity on the other through the equally egotistical voices of authentic protest as they rage against the machine only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption sexuality edit there is a question mark over the relationship between sexuality and egotism sigmund freud popularly made the claim that intimacy can transform the egotist 91 21 93 giving a new sense of humility in relation to others 91 22 93 at the same time it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways 91 23 93 and indeed arguably one s whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs 91 24 93 social egotism edit leo tolstoy used the term aduyevschina after the protagonist aduyev of goncharov s first novel a common story to describe social egotism as the inability of some people to see beyond their immediate interests 91 25 93 etymology edit the term egotism is derived from the greek and subsequently its latinised ego ego meaning self or i and ism used to denote a system of belief as such the term shares early etymology with egoism egoism vs pride edit egoism differs from pride although they share the state of mind of an individual ego is defined by a person s self perception that is how the particular individual thinks feels and distinguishes him herself from others pride may be equated to the feeling one experiences as the direct result of one s accomplishment or success 91 26 93 cultural examples edit a a milne has been praised for his clear eyed vision of the ruthless open unashamed egotism of the young child 91 27 93 ryan
