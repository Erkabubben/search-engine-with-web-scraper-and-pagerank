describes somebody who is highly submissive to their authority figures acts aggressively in the name of said authorities and is conformist in thought and behavior 91 1 93 the prevalence of this personality type in a population varies from culture to culture as a person s upbringing and education play a strong role in determining whether somebody develops this sort of personality 91 2 93 the right wing authoritarian personality was defined by bob altemeyer as a refinement of the research of theodor adorno adorno was the first to propose the existence of an authoritarian personality as part of an attempt to explain the rise of fascism and the holocaust but his theory fell into disfavor because it was based on freudian pseudo science altemeyer nonetheless felt that adorno was on to something and so developed a more scientifically rigorous theory the rwa scale was designed to measure authoritarianism in north america it has proven to be similarly reliable in english speaking countries such as australia but less so in other countries such as france due to cultural differences and translation issues 91 3 93 contents 1 definition 1 1 submissiveness 1 2 aggression 1 3

altemeyer the canadian american social psychologist who first coined the term and its meaning in 1981 defined the right wing authoritarian personality as someone who exhibits 91 4 93 a high degree of submission to the authorities who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives a general aggressiveness directed against various persons that is perceived to be sanctioned by established authorities a high degree of adherence to the social conventions that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities in his writings altemeyer sometimes refers to right wing authoritarians as authoritarian followers this is to emphasize that he is not speaking of authoritarian leaders which is the more commonly understood meaning of authoritarian 91 5 93 altemeyer refers to authoritarian leaders by the term social dominator and he has written extensively on the relationship between authoritarian followers and social dominators submissiveness edit right wing authoritarians tend to accept what their leaders say is true and readily comply with their commands they believe that respecting authority is an important moral virtue that everyone in the community must hold they tend to place strict limits on how far the authorities can be criticized and believe that the critics are troublemakers who don t know what they are talking about rwas are extremely submissive even to authority figures who are dishonest corrupt and inept they will insist that their leaders are honest caring and competent dismissing any evidence to the contrary as either false or inconsequential they believe that the authorities have the right to make their own decisions even if that includes breaking the rules that they impose on everyone else 91 6 93 the leader is somebody whom the authoritarian believes has the moral right if not legal right to rule his society right wing authoritarians are highly submissive to authority figures whom they consider legitimate and conversely can be very rebellious towards authority figures they consider illegitimate an example of the latter is american conservatives attitude towards president barack obama although obama was legally their president and had won the election fair and square many american conservatives felt he had no moral right to be president an aspect of this attitude was the birther movement espousing the conspiracy theory that obama was actually born in kenya and had used a forged birth certificate to qualify himself for office in the united states only natural born citizens may serve as president 91 7 93 aggression edit authoritarians can behave very aggressively towards people whom their leaders have marked as enemies or whom the authoritarians perceive to be threats to the proper social order anyone can become the target of authoritarian aggression but it is more frequently outsiders or socially unconventional people who are targeted examples include communists and jews in nazi germany and feminists and homosexuals in the united states but an authoritarian is more likely than a non authoritarian to attack even conventional people if his authority figures sanction such an attack 91 8 93 altemeyer has further observed that authoritarians prefer to attack when the odds are in their favor going so far as to call authoritarians cowardly because they typically attack victims who cannot defend themselves such as women 91 9 93 the factor that best instigates authoritarian aggression is fear particularly fear of people this can include violent people such as bullies terrorists and foreign invaders but it can also include people they perceive as morally degenerate such as homosexuals and atheists 91 10 93 authoritarians strongly believe in punishment all things being equal they tend to recommend harsher punishments than non authoritarian judges would they are more in favor of corporal punishment and the death penalty 91 11 93 but they tend to be forgiving or even approving if the crime was committed by a high status individual against an unconventional or lower status victim in this regard authoritarian aggression is about enforcing social hierarchies and norms examples cited by altemeyer include a policeman beating up an uppity protester an accountant assaulting a beggar or an anti gay protester assaulting a gay rights activist 91 12 93 conventionalism edit authoritarians have a strong commitment to the traditional norms of society they don t want to be unusual they want to be just like everyone else in their group and likewise they want everyone else to be conventional too diversity irritates them conforming to these norms is not just a social imperative but a moral one authoritarians reject the notion that social norms are arbitrary and that foreign norms are just as valid as theirs 91 13 93 the conventionalism of authoritarians reflects a traditional belief in how people ought to behave that is not necessarily reflective of how most people actually behave 91 14 93 with regards to religion authoritarians tend to be fundamentalists another aspect of conventionalism is sexual norms extra marital sex homosexuality nudity and even certain sexual acts between married partners are seen by authoritarians as perversions assessment edit right wing authoritarianism is measured by the rwa scale which uses a likert scale response subjects are given a questionnaire with 22 statements and for each statement on the questionnaire they must express how far they agree with the statement with one of these ratings very strongly disagree strongly disagree moderately disagree slightly disagree completely neutral slightly agree moderately agree strongly agree and very strongly agree the examiner will then score each response according to how authoritarian it is ranging from 1 to 9 91 15 93 some of these statements are authoritarian in nature while others are liberal so the examiner scores them differently if the subject very strongly agrees with question 4 the examiner will give him 1 point because it is a liberal statement and if he very strongly agrees with 3 the examiner will give him 9 points because it is an authoritarian statement this mixture of authoritarian and liberal statements is designed to prevent test subjects from succumbing to acquiescence bias the established authorities generally turn out to be right about things while the radicals and protestors are usually just loud mouths showing off their ignorance women should have to promise to obey their husbands when they get married our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us gays and lesbians are just as healthy and moral as anybody else it is always better to trust the judgment of the proper authorities in government and religion than to listen to the noisy rabble rousers in our society who are trying to create doubt in people s minds atheists and others who have rebelled against the established religions are no doubt every bit as good and virtuous as those who attend church regularly the only way our country can get through the crisis ahead is to get back to our traditional values put some tough leaders in power and silence the troublemakers spreading bad ideas there is absolutely nothing wrong with nudist camps our country needs free thinkers who have the courage to defy traditional ways even if this upsets many people our country will be destroyed someday if we do not smash the perversions eating away at our moral fiber and traditional beliefs everyone should have their own lifestyle religious beliefs and sexual preferences even if it makes them different from everyone else the old fashioned ways and the old fashioned values still show the best way to live you have to admire those who challenged the law and the majority s view by protesting for women s abortion rights for animal rights or to abolish school prayer what our country really needs is a strong determined leader who will crush evil and take us back to our true path some of the best people in our country are those who are challenging our government criticizing religion and ignoring the normal way things are supposed to be done god s laws about abortion pornography and marriage must be strictly followed before it is too late and those who break them must be strongly punished there are many radical immoral people in our country today who are trying to ruin it for their own godless purposes whom the authorities should put out of action a woman s place should be wherever she wants to be the days when women are submissive to their husbands and social conventions belong strictly in the past our country will be great if we honor the ways of our forefathers do what the authorities tell us to do and get rid of the rotten apples who are ruining everything there is no one right way to live life everybody has to create their own way homosexuals and feminists should be praised for being brave enough to defy traditional family values this country would work a lot better if certain groups of troublemakers would just shut up and accept their group s traditional place in society psychometrically the rwa scale was a significant improvement over the f scale which was the original measure of the authoritarian personality the f scale was worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response thus leaving it susceptible to the acquiescence response bias the rwa scale is balanced to have an equal number of pro and anti authoritarian statements the rwa scale also has excellent internal reliability with coefficient alpha typically measuring between 0 85 and 0 94 91 16 93 the rwa scale has been modified over the years as many of the items lost their social significance as society changed the current version is 22 items long 91 17 93 although altemeyer has continually updated the scale researchers in different domains have tended to lock in on particular versions in the social psychology of religion the 1992 version of the scale is still commonly used 91 18 93 in addition the length of the earlier versions 30 items led many researchers to develop shorter versions of the scale some of those are published 91 19 93 91 20 93 but many researchers simply select a subset of items to use in their research a practice that altemeyer strongly criticizes 91 21 93 the uni dimensionality of the scale has also been challenged recently florian funke showed that it is possible to extract the three underlying dimensions of rwa if the double and triple barreled nature of the items is removed given the possibility of underlying dimensions emerging from the scale it is then the case that the scale is no longer balanced since all the items primarily capturing authoritarian aggression are pro trait worded higher scores mean more authoritarianism and all the items primarily measuring conventionalism are con trait worded higher scores mean less authoritarianism 91 22 93 work by winnifred r louis kenneth i mavor and chris g sibley recently demonstrated that the existence of two or three factors in the rwa scale reflects real differences in these dimensions rather than acquiescence response bias 91 23 93 prevalence edit western countries edit in 2021 morning consult an american data intelligence company published the results of a survey measuring the levels of authoritarianism in adults in america and seven other western countries the study used bob altemeyer s right wing authoritarianism scale but they omitted the following two statements from altemeyer s scale 1 the established authorities generally turn out to be right about things while the radicals and protestors are usually just loud mouths showing off their ignorance and 2 women should have to promise to obey their husbands when they get married morning consult s scale thus had just 20 items with a score range of 20 to 180 points morning consult found that 25 6 of american adults qualify as high rwa scoring between 111 and 180 points while 13 4 of american adults qualify as low rwa scoring 20 to 63 points 91 24 93 altemeyer praised the morning consult survey as the best study ever done on authoritarianism 91 3 93 prevalence among adults in western countries2021 morning consult survey low rwa high rwa survey reliability cronbach s alpha us 13 4 25 6 0 8962 uk 13 6 10 4 0 8814 germany 17 4 6 7 0 8184 france 10 2 10 7 0 7472 spain 17 9 9 2 0 8396 italy 17 9 12 9 0 8426 australia 17 1 12 9 0 8922 canada 21 3 13 4 0 9040 japan edit in 2021 three researchers from kyoto university published a paper containing a japanese translation of altemeyer s rwa scale the researchers wrote that prior to this there were no standardized translations of the rwa scale into japanese 91 25 93 this suggests that research into right wing authoritarianism among the japanese people is immature psychological comorbidities edit difficulty judging evidence edit right wing authoritarians have trouble deciding what facts are valid or irrelevant and making logical deductions consider the following syllogism all fish live in the sea sharks live in the sea therefore sharks are fish although the conclusion of the syllogism happens to be correct the reasoning before it is incorrect sharks are indeed fish but not because they happen to live in the sea whales also live in the sea and some fish live in rivers and lakes right wing authoritarians are far more likely to incorrectly judge the above syllogism to be correct because they liked the conclusion they assume that the reasoning that led it was correct 91 26 93 dogmatism edit authoritarians tend to hold stubbornly to their beliefs even when presented with evidence that suggests their beliefs are wrong this is particularly true concerning beliefs that underpin the identity of the group if anything when confronted with contradictory evidence their beliefs are often reinforced compartmentalized thinking edit the ideas in authoritarians minds are poorly integrated they tend to hold contradictory beliefs in their minds to a degree far greater than what is normal for humans high rwas simply absorb ideas from their peers without thinking about how they fit together in one of his experiments bob altemeyer presented his students a booklet which contained the following statements on different pages when it comes to love men and women with opposite points of view are attracted to each other birds of a feather flock together when it comes to love his students with authoritarian personalities were more likely to agree with both statements even though they are completely contradictory 91 27 93 their tendency to compartmentalize information makes it hard to change the cherished opinion of a high rwa by telling them evidence that contradicts their beliefs they will ignore the contradiction even if they accept the evidence as factual 91 28 93 notes edit according to altemeyer the above mentioned reasoning flaws prevalent among authoritarians are all connected to their instinct to not think for themselves but to absorb their beliefs from their group with particular deference to what the leader tells them to believe if they are to absorb whatever they re taught they must not think critically about the logic of what they re taught a person who can think critically can achieve sustainable beliefs as they come closer to the truth but an unthinking authoritarian can only achieve sustainable beliefs if they stubbornly stick to what they were taught no matter what outsiders tell them ignorance edit altemeyer has observed that authoritarians are often very ignorant when it comes to both general knowledge and current events 91 29 93 lack of self awareness edit authoritarians tend to be lacking in general knowledge particularly on issues with which they disagree authoritarians also are often unaware of just how different they are from most people they tend to believe they are very average altemeyer has found that authoritarians in america underestimate how prejudiced and conformist they are compared to the majority of americans altemeyer has also observed that when he lectures about the psychology of right wing authoritarians to his students the rwa students in his class fail to recognize themselves in his description 91 30 93 altemeyer believes the tendency of authoritarians to avoid anyone who isn t like them reinforces their belief that they are normal they have relatively little contact with normal people sensitivity to disgust edit right wing authoritarians tend to be more easily disgusted in general this includes things such as body odor 91 31 93 and unconventional sexual practices such as homosexuality relationship with social dominators edit jim sidanius and felicia pratto created the social dominance orientation sdo scale which describes people who crave power over others bob altemeyer has used the sdo scale to study the relationship between authoritarian followers and authoritarian leaders authoritarian followers are attracted to domineering leaders this is measured in one of the items on the rwa scale our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us they are more likely to obey and approve of the leader s unethical actions than a low rwa 91 32 93 and likewise social dominators seeking power like to appeal to authoritarians because their loyalty is easy to acquire and hold if the sd just tells them what they want to hear and they are gullible and will turn a blind eye to his indiscretions 91 33 93 91 34 93 social dominators differ from authoritarian followers in several important ways both personality types demand loyalty from others but rwas usually reciprocate that loyalty whereas sds have a tendency to betray their followers when it suits them 91 35 93 social dominators lack the irrational thinking patterns common to rwas such as compartmentalized thinking and hypocrisy they might often spout contradictory and illogical things in order to manipulate their rwa followers but they are usually aware of the bad logic in their arguments they don t care as long as it gets them what they want social dominators are also more self aware than rwas for instance rwas often do not realize how abnormally prejudiced they are whereas sds often do and are comfortable with that 91 36 93 91 37 93 the aggression of rwas is mainly motivated by fear and by sanction by authorities whereas the aggression of social dominators is motivated by a general desire to dominate others altemeyer has found that today in america sds are more hostile to racial minorities than rwas because racism has become less socially acceptable and even illegal and rwas to an extent want to conform to this norm which conflicts with their instinctive ethnocentrism 91 38 93 altemeyer believes this relationship explains why autocratic countries tend to have oppressive highly hierarchical societies where women homosexuals and religious minorities are oppressed and higher levels of corruption generally speaking autocratic rulers hold power through the support of a smaller fraction of their citizens than leaders in democratic countries do under these circumstances the support of rwas is desirable because their loyalty is easy to acquire and hold if the leader appeals to their instinctive desire for conformity and hierarchy by contrast leaders in democratic countries such as france and canada need to build a broader support base among the citizens to hold onto power and the autocrat s appeal to authoritarian values will not go well because rwas are too small a minority the democratic leader is forced to consider the desires of centrists and left wing citizens and such citizens demand tolerance liberty and low corruption left wing authoritarians edit in political philosophy the classic definition of left wing describes somebody who advocates social equality and right wing describes somebody who advocates social hierarchy the existence of the soviet union and the people s republic of china raised the question of whether there is such a thing as left wing authoritarians since these countries were highly authoritarian yet also left wing this article concerns itself with the concept of authoritarianism as a personality type rather than a political ideology the question that psychologists therefore asked was whether authoritarian individuals in communist countries are psychologically the same as right wing authoritarians in america or whether they are different enough to warrant a distinct category of their own altemeyer edit in some of his writings bob altemeyer thinks of a right wing authoritarian as someone who submits to the established authorities in society whereas a left wing authoritarian submits to authorities who want to overthrow the establishment this distinction is one of circumstance not personality 91 39 93 he asserts the nazis were left wing authoritarians before they rose to power and after they took power they became right wing authoritarians 91 40 93 rigidity of thought edit after reviewing a number of studies john t jost concluded that the evidence strongly favored the hypothesis that people on the political right particularly the far right are more rigid in their thinking than people on the political left even counting those on the far left 91 41 93 politics edit united states edit research has shown that since the 1960s voters who prefer authoritarian leadership styles are more likely to support republican candidates supporters of former u s president donald trump were more likely than non trump supporting republicans to score highly on authoritarian aggression and group based dominance furthermore many left leaning authoritarians have become less engaged with politics and voting 91 42 93 a study by monmouth university found that 40 of people who voted for trump in the 2020 presidential election scored in the highest quartile on the rwa scale by contrast only a negligible number of joe biden supporters scored that highly the same study found that those trump supporters who scored highly on the rwa scale were more likely than other trump supporters to endorse conspiracy theories such as the idea that the election was rigged by the democratic party 91 43 93 according to karen stenner an australian professor who specializes in authoritarianism authoritarianism is different from conservatism because authoritarianism reflects aversion to difference across space i e diversity of people and beliefs at a given moment while conservatism reflects aversion to difference over time i e change stenner argues that conservatives will embrace racial diversity civil liberties and moral freedom to the extent they are already institutionalized authoritatively supported traditions and are therefore supportive of social stability conservatives tend to be drawn to authoritarianism when public opinion is fractious and there is a loss of confidence in public institutions but in general they value stability and certainty over increased uniformity however stenner says that authoritarians also want difference restricted even when so doing would require significant social change and instability 91 44 93 research edit according to research by altemeyer right wing authoritarians tend to exhibit cognitive errors and symptoms of faulty reasoning specifically they are more likely to make incorrect inferences from evidence and to hold contradictory ideas that result from compartmentalized thinking they are also more likely to uncritically accept insufficient evidence that supports their beliefs and they are less likely to acknowledge their own limitations 91 45 93 whether right wing authoritarians are less intelligent than average is disputed with stenner arguing that variables such as high verbal ability indicative of high cognitive capacity have a very substantial ameliorative effect in diminishing authoritarian tendencies 91 44 93 however one study suggested the apparent negative relationship between cognition and rwa could be partially explained by methodological issues 91 46 93 measured against other factors of personality authoritarians generally score lower on openness to experience and slightly higher on conscientiousness 91 47 93 91 48 93 91 49 93 altemeyer suggested that authoritarian politicians are more likely to be in the conservative or reform party in canada or the republican party in the united states they generally have a conservative economic philosophy are highly nationalistic oppose abortion support capital punishment oppose gun control legislation and do not value social equality 91 45 93 the rwa scale reliably correlates with political party affiliation reactions to watergate pro capitalist attitudes religious orthodoxy and acceptance of covert governmental activities such as illegal wiretaps 91 45 93 authoritarians are generally more favorable to punishment and control than personal freedom and diversity they are more willing to suspend constitutional guarantees of liberty such as the bill of rights they are more likely to advocate strict punitive sentences for criminals 91 50 93 and report that punishing such people is satisfying for them they tend to be ethnocentric and prejudiced against racial and ethnic minorities 91 51 93 and homosexuals 91 52 93 91 53 93 however stenner argues that authoritarians will support programs intended to increase opportunities for minority groups such as affirmative action if they believe such programs will lead to greater societal uniformity 91 44 93 in roleplaying situations authoritarians tend to seek dominance over others by being competitive and destructive instead of cooperative in a study by altemeyer 68 authoritarians played a three hour simulation of the earth s future entitled the global change game unlike a comparison game played by individuals with low rwa scores which resulted in world peace and widespread international cooperation the simulation by authoritarians became highly militarized and eventually entered the stage of nuclear war by the end of the high rwa game the entire population of the earth was declared dead 91 45 93 the vast majority of research on right wing authoritarianism has been done in the united states and canada however a 2003 cross cultural study examined the relation between authoritarianism and individualism collectivism in samples 1 080 from bulgaria canada germany japan new zealand poland and the united states both at the individual level and the societal level authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism or dominance seeking and vertical or hierarchical collectivism which is the tendency to submit to the demands of one s ingroup 91 54 93 a study done on both israeli and palestinian students in israel found that rwa scores of right wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left wing party supporters and scores of secular subjects were lowest 91 55 93 right wing authoritarianism has been found to correlate only slightly with social dominance orientation sdo the two measures can be thought of as two sides of the same coin as rwa provides submissive followers and sdo provides power seeking leaders 91 56 93 some recent research has argued that the association with rwa and prejudice has dominated research into rwa with recent developments discovering a more complicated relationship 91 57 93 relationship to personality traits edit research comparing rwa with the big five personality traits has found that rwa is positively correlated with conscientiousness r 0 15 and negatively correlated with openness to experience r 0 36 sdo has a somewhat different pattern of correlations with the big five as it is also associated with low openness to experience r 0 16 but is not significantly correlated with conscientiousness r 0 05 and instead has a negative correlation with agreeableness r 0 29 low openness to experience and high conscientiousness have been found to be predictive of social conformity people low in openness to experience tend to prefer clear unambiguous moral rules and are more likely to support the existing social order insofar as it provides clear guidance about social norms for behavior and how the world should be people low in openness to experience are also more sensitive to threats both real and symbolic to the social order and hence tend to view outgroups who deviate from traditional social norms and values as a threat to ingroup norms and values conscientiousness is associated with a preference for order structure and security hence this might explain the connection with rwa 91 47 93 causes of rwa personality edit the roots of the right wing authoritarian personality are mostly down to genetics a conclusion that comes from twin studies 91 58 93 education levels are also a factor with a four year undergraduate education found to lower rwa scores by approximately 10 91 59 93 criticism and development edit a recent refinement to this body of research was presented in karen stenner s 2005 book the authoritarian dynamic stenner argues that rwa is best understood as expressing a dynamic response to external threat not a static disposition based only on the traits of submission aggression and conventionalism stenner is critical of altemeyer s social learning interpretation and argues that it cannot account for how levels of authoritarianism fluctuate with social conditions she argues that the rwa scale can be viewed as a measure of expressed authoritarianism but that other measures are needed to assess authoritarian predispositions which interact with threatening circumstances to produce the authoritarian response 91 60 93 recent criticism has also come as a result of treating rwa as uni dimensional even in contexts where it makes no sense to do so this include rwa being used in regression analyses with fundamentalism as another predictor and attitudes to homosexuality and racism as the outcomes 91 61 93 this research seemed to show that fundamentalism would be associated with reduced racism once the authoritarian component was removed and this was summarized in a recent review of the field 91 62 93 however since the rwa scale has items that also measure fundamentalist religiosity and attitudes to homosexuality this undermines the interpretation of such analyses 91 63 93 91 64 93 even worse is the possibility that the unrecognised dimensionality in rwa can cause a statistical artifact to arise in such regressions which can reduce or even reverse some of the relationships mavor and colleagues have argued that this artifact eliminates or even reverses any apparent tendency for fundamentalism to reduce racism once rwa is controlled the implication is that in some domains such as the social psychology of religion it is not only preferable to think of rwa as consisting of at least two components but it is essential in order to avoid statistical errors and incorrect conclusions 91 64 93 several options currently exist for scales that acknowledge at least the two main underlying components in the scale aggression submission and conventionalism 91 20 93 91 22 93 91 23 93 91 64 93 91 65 93 91 66 93 91 67 93 altemeyer s research on authoritarianism has been challenged by psychologist john j ray who questions the sampling methods used and the ability of the rwa scale to predict authoritarian behavior and provides evidence that the rwa scale measures conservatism rather than directiveness a construct that john j ray invented and that he relates to authoritarianism 91 68 93 91 69 93 however ray s approach is a minority position among researchers 91 70 93 and other psychologists have found that both the rwa scale and the original f scale are good predictors of both attitudes and behavior 91 71 93 in 2012 the american journal of political science 91 72 93 published an article discussing the correlation between conservatism and psychoticism which they associated with authoritarianism among other traits in 2015 they released an erratum showing mixed correlations 91 73 93 in 2017 the new regality theory suggested a reinterpretation of rwa in the light of evolutionary psychology regality theory agrees that authoritarianism is a dynamic response to external threats but rather than seeing it as a psychological aberration regality theory posits that authoritarianism is an evolved response to perceived collective danger the tendency to support a strong leader when faced with common existential threats has contributed to darwinian fitness in human prehistory because it helped solve the collective action problem in war and suppress free riders it is argued that regality theory adds a deeper level of analysis to our understanding of authoritarianism and avoids the political bias that the research in the authoritarian personality and rwa is often criticized for 91 74 93 in 2019 ronald inglehart combined rwa with his theory of postmaterialism arguing that both reflected the tendency of insecure environments to produce individuals whose worldview values conformism over self expression 91 75 93 although some earlier scholars had claimed that a comparable construct of left wing authoritarianism lwa on the political left does not exist and compared the search for lwa to trying to find the loch ness monster more recent work suggests the possibility that lwa does exist and that it predicts similar outcomes as rwa 91 76 93 this has spurred debate about whether liberals might be similarly authoritarian as conservatives 91 77 93 honeycutt et al argue that rwa scores may be misrepresented by distribution as high scorers on the scale may actually have moderate scores and are only high relative to lower scorers rather than scoring high on the scale in any absolute sense thus differences between high and low scorers may be exaggerated 91 78 93 history edit the theoretical concept of right wing authoritarianism was introduced in 1981 by the canadian american social psychologist bob altemeyer 91 1 93 as a refinement of the authoritarian personality theory originally pioneered by university of california berkeley researchers theodor w adorno else frenkel brunswik daniel levinson and nevitt sanford 91 79 93 after extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis altemeyer found that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together authoritarian submission authoritarian aggression and conventionalism researchers have traditionally assumed that there was just one kind of authoritarian personality who could be either a follower or a leader the discovery that followers and leaders are usually different types of authoritarians is based on research done by sam mcfarland 91 56 93 altemeyer describes another scale called social dominance which measures how domineering a person is altemeyer calls people who score highly on both his right wing authoritarian and social dominance scales as double highs 91 56 93 see also edit psychology portal authoritarian personality f scale social dominance orientation conformity fascist insult postmaterialism system

happens in dark and cowardly ways in the dark by cowards who later will do everything they possibly can to avoid responsibility for what they did women children and others unable to defend themselves

as they do and enjoying dishing it out as they do high rwas are more likely in general to sentence wrongdoers to long prison terms but this is not true if the wrongdoers are officials whom the authoritarian admires or if the crime involved attacking someone highs believe should be attacked the child molester the hippie the uppity demonstrator vietnamese peasants and gay activists in these

authoritarian nightmare chpt 6 and as new ideas crash into the old ones people try to make sense of what they have learned many of us integrate but high rwas do not they stick with the old truths and if a new learning contradicts an old one it makes no difference because everything is in its own place and not to be disturbed so even if you win the argument it is not likely to change their minds altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 4 they can be woefully uninformed about things they oppose but they prefer ignorance and want to make others become as ignorant as they they are also surprisingly uninformed about the things they say they believe in and deep deep deep down inside many of them have secret doubts about their core belief altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 3 and when i give feedback lectures to classes about my studies and describe right wing authoritarians it turns out the high rwas in the room almost always think i am talking about someone else marco tullio

a lot more than the low rwas did in fact they liked it they said in private afterwards it was the right thing to do and they gave their boss a high rating the less authoritarian students did not like the boss s decision and said so and they did not like the boss either dean altemeyer 2020 authoritarian nightmare chpt 7 so suppose for the sake of argument that you are a power hungry manipulative totally unethical slimeball who decides to enter politics you do stand for a few things but it is best for you that the public never finds out what exactly you need an army of gullible followers who will believe you when you are lying inside out and upside down and through your teeth turns out large clusters of chumps exist they are the authoritarian followers we have been addressing and they will lift you on high if you tell them you devoutly believe whatever they devoutly believe they will gladly ignore reasons why you might be less trustworthy which are conspicuous to most people altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 3 then once they have their ideas someone who comes along and says what authoritarian followers want to hear becomes trustworthy high rwas largely ignore the reasons why someone might have ulterior motives for saying what they want to hear it s enough for them that another person indicates they are right altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 5 in a similar vein remember those group cohesiveness items in chapter 3 such as for any group to succeed all its members have to give it their complete loyalty we saw that authoritarian followers endorse such sentiments but social dominators do not oh sure they want their followers to be super loyal to the group they lead but they themselves are not really in it so much for the group or its cause but more for themselves it s all about them not about a higher purpose if trouble arises don t be surprised if they start playing every man for himself and even sell out the group to save their own skin altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 5 persons who score highly on the social dominance scale do not usually have all the nooks and crannies contradictions and lost files in their mental life that we find in high rwas most of them do not show weak reasoning abilities highly compartmentalized thinking and certainly not a tendency to trust people who tell them what they want to hear they ve got their head together nor are most of them dogmatic or particularly zealous about any cause or philosophy so like high rwas social dominators are quite capable of hypocrisy the difference being that the rwas probably don t realize the hypocrisy because their thinking is so compartmentalized whereas the dominators do but don t care dean altemeyer 2020 authoritarian nightmare chpt 6 if their parents were anti semitic if most of the people they associate with are anti semitic they will think their own negative attitudes toward jewish people are ordinary free of any hint of prejudice just the truth if you showed them how prejudiced they are compared to most people they will say it simply could not be so conversely social dominators will say yeah you re right i hate jews so what altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 5 however when it comes to racial and ethnic minorities right wing authoritarians will still aggress overtly or sneakily physically or verbally but such attacks are less clearly supported by religious and civic authorities than they used to be so their prejudice in these cases has dropped some but not that of social dominators altemeyer 2010 the authoritarians chpt 1 an authoritarian follower submits excessively to some authorities aggresses in their name and insists on everyone following their rules if these authorities are the established authorities in society that s right wing authoritarianism if one submits to authorities who want to overthrow the establishment that s left wing authoritarianism as i define things altemeyer 1996 the authoritarian specter pp 218 219 such extremist groups while submissive to their own perceived legitimate authorities would be psychological left wingers on a societal level during their opposition to the establishment but should their movement attain power in the flash of a revolution their strong submission to the new societal authority would make them psychological right wing authoritarians on that level as they became in germany and russia i am proposing in short an underlying authoritarian personality that can be either psychologically left wing or right wing depending on who holds power and can be found at either extreme of the political spectrum jost 2021 left and right chpt 2 the available data which we summarize in chapter 4 provide consistent support for the rigidity of the right hypothesis no
