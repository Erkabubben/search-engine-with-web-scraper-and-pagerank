edit early to mid 20th century edit main article party line politics in the early to mid 20th century the phrase politically correct was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies within politics in 1934 the new york times reported that nazi germany was granting reporting permits only to pure aryans whose opinions are politically correct 91 5 93 the term political correctness first appeared in marxist leninist vocabulary following the russian revolution of 1917 at that time it was used to describe strict adherence to the policies and principles of the communist party of the soviet union that is the party line 91 25 93 later in the united states the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatism in debates between communists and socialists according to american educator herbert kohl writing about debates in new york in the late 1940s and early 1950s the term politically correct was used disparagingly to refer to someone whose loyalty to the cp line overrode compassion and led to bad politics it was used by socialists against communists and was meant to separate out socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic communists who would advocate and defend party positions regardless of their moral substance 8201 uncommon differences the lion and the unicorn 91 4 93 1970s edit main article new left in the 1970s

chauvinist too william safire records this as the first use in the typical modern sense 91 26 93 the term political correctness was believed to have been revived by the new left through familiarity in the west with mao s little red book in which mao stressed holding to the correct party line the term rapidly began to be used by the new left in an ironic or self deprecating sense 91 27 93 thereafter the term was often used as self critical satire debra l shultz said that throughout the 1970s and 1980s the new left feminists and progressives used their term politically correct ironically as a guard against their own orthodoxy in social change efforts 91 8 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 pc is used in the comic book merton of the movement by bobby london which was followed by the term ideologically sound in the comic strips of bart dickon 91 13 93 91 28 93 in her essay toward a feminist revolution 1992 ellen willis said in the early eighties when feminists used the term political correctness it was used to refer sarcastically to the anti pornography movement s efforts to define a feminist sexuality 91 15 93 stuart hall suggests one way in which the original use of the term may have developed into the modern one according to one version political correctness actually began as an in joke on the left radical students on american campuses acting out an ironic replay of the bad old days bs before the sixties when every revolutionary groupuscule had a party line about everything they would address some glaring examples of sexist or racist behaviour by their fellow students in imitation of the tone of voice of the red guards or cultural revolution commissar not very politically correct comrade 91 16 93 the term probably entered use in the modern sense in the united kingdom around

93 prof of social work at csu tony platt says the campaign against political correctness was launched by bloom s book in 1987 91 34 93 an october 1990 new york times article by richard bernstein is credited with popularizing the term 91 35 93 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 91 39 93 at this time the term was mainly being used within academia across the country the term p c as it is commonly abbreviated is being heard more and more in debates over what should be taught at the universities 91 40 93 nexis citations in arcnews curnews reveal only seventy total citations in articles to political correctness for 1990 but one year later nexis records 1 532 citations with a steady increase to more than 7 000 citations by 1994 91 38 93 91 41 93 in may 1991 the new york times had a follow up article according to which the term was increasingly being used in a wider public arena what has come to be called political correctness a term that began to gain currency at the start of the academic year last fall has spread in recent months and has become the focus of an angry national debate mainly on campuses but also in the larger arenas of american life 8201 robert d mcfadden political correctness new bias test 1991 91 42 93 the previously obscure far left term became common currency in the lexicon of the conservative social and political challenges against progressive teaching methods and curriculum changes in the secondary schools and universities of the u s 91 10 93 91 43 93 91 44 93 91 45 93 91 46 93 91 47 93 policies behavior and speech codes that the speaker or the writer regarded as being the imposition of a liberal orthodoxy were described and criticized as politically correct 91 18 93 in may 1991 at a commencement ceremony for a graduating class of the university of michigan then u s president george h w bush used the term in his speech the notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land and although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred it replaces old prejudice with new ones it declares certain topics off limits certain expression off limits even certain gestures off limits 91 48 93 91 49 93 91 50 93 after 1991 its use as a pejorative phrase became widespread amongst conservatives in the us 91 10 93 it became a key term encapsulating conservative concerns about the left in cultural and political debates extending beyond academia two articles on the topic in late 1990 in forbes and newsweek both used the term thought police in their headlines exemplifying the tone of the new usage but it was dinesh d souza s illiberal education the politics of race and sex on campus 1991 which captured the press s imagination 91 10 93 similar critical terminology was used by d souza for a range of policies in academia around victimization supporting multiculturalism through affirmative action sanctions against anti minority hate speech and revising curricula sometimes referred to as canon busting 91 10 93 91 a 93 91 failed verification 93 these trends were at least in part a response to multiculturalism and the rise of identity politics with movements such as feminism gay rights movements and ethnic minority movements that response received funding from conservative foundations and think tanks such as the john m olin foundation which funded several books such as d souza s 91 8 93 91 18 93 herbert kohl in 1992 commented that a number of neoconservatives who promoted the use of the term politically correct in the early 1990s were former communist party members and as a result familiar with the marxist use of the phrase he argued that in doing so they intended to insinuate that egalitarian democratic ideas are actually authoritarian orthodox and communist influenced when they oppose the right of people to be racist sexist and homophobic 91 4 93 during the 1990s conservative and right wing politicians think tanks and speakers adopted the phrase as a pejorative descriptor of their ideological enemies especially in the context of the culture wars about language and the content of public school curricula roger kimball in tenured radicals endorsed frederick crews s view that pc is best described as left eclecticism a term defined by kimball as any of a wide variety of anti establishment modes of thought from structuralism and poststructuralism deconstruction and lacanian analyst to feminist homosexual black and other patently political forms of criticism 91 53 93 91 32 93 liberal commentators have argued that the conservatives and reactionaries who used the term did so in an effort to divert political discussion away from the substantive matters of resolving societal discrimination 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 such as racial social class gender and legal inequality against people whom conservatives do not consider part of the social mainstream 91 8 93 91 19 93 91 57 93 jan narveson wrote that that phrase was born to live between scare quotes it suggests that the operative considerations in the area so called are merely political steamrolling the genuine reasons of principle for which we ought to be acting 91 9 93 commenting in 2001 one such british journalist 91 58 93 91 59 93 polly toynbee said the phrase is an empty right wing smear designed only to elevate its user 91 60 93 and in 2010 she wrote the phrase political correctness was born as a coded cover for all who still want to say paki spastic or queer 91 61 93 another british journalist will hutton 91 62 93 91 63 93 91 64 93 91 65 93 wrote in 2001 91 66 93 political correctness is one of the brilliant tools that the american right developed in the mid 1980s as part of its demolition of american liberalism what the sharpest thinkers on the american right saw quickly was that by declaring war on the cultural manifestations of liberalism by levelling the charge of political correctness against its exponents they could discredit the whole political project 8201 will hutton words really are important mr blunkett 2001 glenn loury wrote in 1994 that to address the subject of political correctness when power and authority within the academic community is being contested by parties on either side of that issue is to invite scrutiny of one s arguments by would be friends and enemies combatants from the left and the right will try to assess whether a writer is for them or against them 91 67 93 geoffrey hughes suggested that debate over political correctness concerns whether changing language actually solves political and social problems with critics viewing it less about solving problems than imposing censorship intellectual intimidation and demonstrating the moral purity of those who practice it hughes also argues that political correctness tends to be pushed by a minority rather than an organic form of language change 91 68 93 usage edit the modern pejorative usage of the term emerged from conservative criticism of the new left in the late 20th century this usage was popularized by a number of articles in the new york times and other media throughout the 1990s 91 35 93 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 40 93 91 42 93 91 69 93 and was widely used in the debate surrounding allan bloom s 1987 book the closing of the american mind 91 8 93 91 29 93 91 30 93 the term gained further currency in response to roger kimball s tenured radicals 1990 91 8 93 91 18 93 91 53 93 and conservative author dinesh d souza s 1991 book illiberal education 91 8 93 91 10 93 91 18 93 91 70 93 supporters of politically correct language have been pejoratively referred to as the language police 91 71 93 education edit modern debate on the term was sparked by conservative critiques of perceived liberal bias in academia and education 91 8 93 and conservatives have since used it as a major line of attack 91 10 93 similarly a common conservative criticism of higher education in the united states is that the political views of teaching staff are more liberal than those of the general population and that this contributes to an atmosphere of political correctness 91 72 93 91 non primary source needed 93 william deresiewicz defines political correctness as an attempt to silence unwelcome beliefs and ideas arguing that it is largely the result of for profit education as campus faculty and staff are wary of angering students upon whose fees they depend 91 73 93 91 non primary source needed 93 preliminary research published in 2020 indicated that students at a large u s public university generally felt instructors were open minded and encouraged free expression of diverse viewpoints nonetheless most students worried about the consequences of voicing their political opinions with a nxieties about expressing political views and self censorship more prevalent among students who identify as conservative 91 74 93 91 75 93 as a conspiracy theory edit main article cultural marxism conspiracy theory some conservative commentators in the west argue that political correctness and multiculturalism are part of a conspiracy with the ultimate goal of undermining judeo christian values this theory which holds that political correctness originates from the critical theory of the frankfurt school as part of a conspiracy that its proponents call cultural marxism 91 76 93 91 77 93 the theory originated with michael minnicino s 1992 essay new dark age frankfurt school and political correctness published in a lyndon larouche movement journal 91 78 93 in 2001 conservative commentator patrick buchanan wrote in the death of the west that political correctness is cultural marxism and that its trademark is intolerance 91 79 93 media edit see also media bias in the us the term has been widely used in books and journals but in britain the usage has been confined mainly to the popular press 91 80 93 many such authors and popular media figures particularly on the right have used the term to criticize what they see as bias in the media 91 9 93 91 18 93 william mcgowan argues that journalists get stories wrong or ignore stories worthy of coverage because of what mcgowan perceives to be their liberal ideologies and their fear of offending minority groups 91 81 93 robert novak in his essay political correctness has no place in the newsroom used the term to blame newspapers for adopting language use policies that he thinks tend to excessively avoid the appearance of bias he argued that political correctness in language not only destroys meaning but also demeans the people who are meant to be protected 91 82 93 91 83 93 91 84 93 authors david sloan and emily hoff claim that in the us journalists shrug off concerns about political correctness in the newsroom equating the political correctness criticisms with the old liberal media bias label 91 85 93 according to author john wilson left wing forces of political correctness have been blamed for unrelated censorship with time citing campaigns against violence on network television in the us as contributing to a mainstream culture that has become cautious sanitized scared of its own shadow because of the watchful eye of the p c police protests and advertiser boycotts targeting tv shows are generally organized by right wing religious groups campaigning against violence sex and depictions of homosexuality on television 91
