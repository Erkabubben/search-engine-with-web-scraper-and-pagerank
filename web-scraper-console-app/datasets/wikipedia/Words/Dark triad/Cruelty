cruelty is the pleasure in inflicting suffering or inaction towards another s suffering when a clear remedy is readily available 91 1 93 sadism can also be related to this form of action or concept cruel ways of inflicting suffering may involve violence but affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel for example if a person is drowning and begging for help and another person is able to help with no cost or risk but is merely watching with disinterest or perhaps mischievous amusement that person is being cruel rather than violent george eliot stated that cruelty like every other vice requires no motive outside itself it only requires opportunity 91 2 93 bertrand russell stated that the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell 91 2 93 gilbert k chesterton stated that cruelty is perhaps the worst kind of sin intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty 91 2 93 the word has metaphorical uses for example the cliffs remained cruel i e unclimbable when they desperately needed to be climbed in the lord of the rings contents 1 four conceptions of cruelty 2 usage in law 3 etymology 4 criticism 5 see also 6 references 7 notes 8 external links four conceptions of cruelty edit there are four distinct conceptions of cruelty the differences between these conceptions of cruelty rest on the types of agency victimization causality and values that they employ 91 3 93 the first is the agent objective conception which is exemplified by agency that goes above in degree and beyond in type the suffering allowed by applicable norms 91 3 93 under this conception the victim suffered cruelty in light of the objective character of the act or treatment she was subjected to cruelty in this sense is defined as an inclination of the mind toward the side of harshness 91 3 93 any punishment or other treatment that surpasses the scope of sufficiency and ventures into possibility is classified as excessive and therefore cruel the second conception is agent subjective in which cruelty obtains only when the agent s deviant behavior is accompanied by the fault of character consisting in deriving personal delight from causing and witnessing suffering 91 3 93 this conception is best understood under the presumption that punishment or other violence is a means to restore the offset in the cosmic order of the universe caused by wrongdoing anything that goes beyond what is necessary for this restoration then is cruel the peace and harmony is not balanced with excessive punishment or violence the scale of wrongdoing merely tips to the other side for example the eighth amendment of the u s constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment which means that we must inquire into a prison official s state of mind when determining that the agent is not taking pleasure in inflicting pain and that punishment does not exceed the crime 91 3 93 the third conception is victim subjective in which the element of cruelty rests in the victim s intense experience of suffering 91 3 93 here the pain or the sense of degradation and humiliation experienced particularly and uniquely by the victim is considered recognizing cruelty then requires reference to our compassion rather than some normative standard of reasonableness continuing with the example of punishment the state s intention is not relevant in determining whether a punishment is cruel according to the law ill treatment must attain a minimum level of severity and this minimum is determined by all the circumstances of the case such as the duration of the treatment its physical or mental effects and in some cases the sex age and state of health of the victim etc 91 3 93 the fourth and final conception is the accumulation of all the prior conceptions the victim objective and agent independent this conception refers to severe violations of the respect recognition and care that the unconditional and inherent dignity of each and every individual command 91 3 93 under this view cruelty occurs when a grave violation of human dignity that in normal circumstances would amount to cruelty is caused by individuals or by the operation of impersonal institutions structures or social processes even if the victim is unaware of his predicament 91 3 93 beyond serving as an analytical framework these four conceptions the distinctive features of each as well as their collective evolution reflect the reality that the phenomenon of cruelty is a human made problem that calls for preventive and corrective responses 91 3 93 usage in law edit the term cruelty is often used in law and criminology with regard to the treatment of animals children spouses and prisoners 91 4 93 when cruelty to animals is discussed it often refers to unnecessary suffering in criminal law it refers to punishment torture victimization draconian measures and cruel and unusual punishment 91 5 93 91 6 93 in divorce cases many jurisdictions permit a cause of action for cruel and inhumane treatment 91 7 93 in law cruelty is the infliction of physical or mental distress especially when considered a determinant in granting a divorce 91 8 93 etymology edit the term comes from middle english via the old french term crualte which is based on latin crudelitas from crudelis 91 9 93 criticism edit one criticism of the concept of cruelty points at the concept of conflating disregard for others with hurting others for its own sake arguing that the two are mutually exclusive as total disregard for what another being feels be it a human or non human would be incompatible with deriving pleasure from hurting that being for its own sake since caring about inflicting suffering would be incompatible with not caring 91 10 93 see also edit abuse
