attributes and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 it may also mean prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity 91 2 93 modern variants of racism are often based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples these views can take the form of social actions practices or beliefs or political systems in which different races are ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other based on presumed shared inheritable traits abilities or qualities 91 2 93 91 4 93 there have been attempts to legitimize racist beliefs through scientific means such as scientific racism which have been overwhelmingly shown to be unfounded in terms of political systems e g apartheid that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices or laws racist ideology may include associated social aspects such as nativism xenophobia otherness segregation hierarchical ranking and supremacism while the concepts of race and ethnicity are considered to be separate in contemporary social science the two terms have a long history of equivalence in popular usage and older social science literature ethnicity is often used in a sense close to one traditionally attributed to race the division of human groups based on qualities assumed to be essential or innate to the group e g shared ancestry or shared behavior racism and racial discrimination are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis independent of whether these differences are described as racial according to the united nations s convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination there is no distinction between the terms racial and ethnic discrimination it further concludes that superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false morally condemnable socially unjust and dangerous the convention also declared that there is no justification for racial discrimination anywhere in theory or in practice 91 5 93 racism is a relatively modern concept arising in the european age of imperialism the subsequent growth of capitalism and especially the atlantic slave trade 91 1 93 91 6 93 of which it was a major driving force 91 7 93 it was also a major force behind racial segregation in the united states in the 19th and early 20th centuries and of apartheid in south africa 19th and 20th century racism in western culture is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism 91 8 93 racism has played a role in genocides such as the holocaust the armenian genocide the rwandan genocide and the genocide of serbs in the independent state of croatia as well as colonial projects including the european colonization of the americas africa asia and the population transfer in the soviet union including deportations of indigenous minorities 91 9 93 indigenous peoples have been and are often subject to racist attitudes contents 1 etymology definition and usage 1 1 legal 1 2 social and behavioral sciences 1 3

categoryvte an early use of the word racism by richard henry pratt in 1902 association of races and classes is necessary to destroy racism and classism in the 19th century many scientists subscribed to the belief that the human population can be divided into races the term racism is a noun describing the state of being racist i e subscribing to the belief that the human population can or should be classified into races with differential abilities and dispositions which in turn may motivate a political ideology in which rights and privileges are differentially distributed based on racial categories the term racist may be an adjective or a noun the latter describing a person who holds those beliefs 91 10 93 the origin of the root word race is not clear linguists generally agree that it came to the english language from middle french but there is no such agreement on how it generally came into latin based languages a recent proposal is that it derives from the arabic ra s which means head beginning origin or the hebrew rosh which has a similar meaning 91 11 93 early race theorists generally held the view that some races were inferior to others and they consequently believed that the differential treatment of races was fully justified 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 these early theories guided pseudo scientific research assumptions the collective endeavors to adequately define and form hypotheses about racial differences are generally termed scientific racism though this term is a misnomer due to the lack of any actual science backing the claims most biologists anthropologists and sociologists reject a taxonomy of races in favor of more specific and or empirically verifiable criteria such as geography ethnicity or a history of endogamy 91 15 93 human genome research indicates that race is not a meaningful genetic classification of humans 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 an entry in the oxford english dictionary 2008 defines racialism as a n earlier term than racism but now largely superseded by it and cites the term racialism in a 1902 quote 91 20 93 the revised oxford english dictionary cites the shorter term racism in a quote from the year 1903 91 21 93 it was defined by the oxford english dictionary 2nd edition 1989 as t he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race the same dictionary termed racism a synonym of racialism belief in the superiority of a particular race by the end of world war ii racism had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with racialism racism by then implied racial discrimination racial supremacism and a harmful intent the term race hatred had also been used by sociologist frederick hertz in the late 1920s as its history indicates the popular use of the word racism is relatively recent the word came into widespread usage in the western world in the 1930s when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of nazism which treated race as a naturally given political unit 91 22 93 it is commonly agreed that racism existed before the coinage of the word but there is not a wide agreement on a single definition of what racism is and what it is not 91 12 93 today some scholars of racism prefer to use the concept in the plural racisms in order to emphasize its many different forms that do not easily fall under a single definition they also argue that different forms of racism have characterized different historical periods and geographical areas 91 23 93 garner 2009 p 160 11 summarizes different existing definitions of racism and identifies three common elements contained in those definitions of racism first a historical hierarchical power relationship between groups second a set of ideas an ideology about racial differences and third discriminatory actions practices 91 12 93 legal though many countries around the globe have passed laws related to race and discrimination the first significant international human rights instrument developed by the united nations un was the universal declaration of human rights udhr 91 24 93 which was adopted by the united nations general assembly in 1948 the udhr recognizes that if people are to be treated with dignity they require economic rights social rights including education and the rights to cultural and political participation and civil liberty it further states that everyone is entitled to these rights without distinction of any kind such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status the un does not define racism however it does define racial discrimination according to the 1965 un international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination 91 25 93 the term racial discrimination shall mean any distinction exclusion restriction or preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life in their 1978 united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco declaration on race and racial prejudice article 1 the un states all human beings belong to a single species and are descended from a common stock they are born equal in dignity and rights and all form an integral part of humanity 91 26 93 the un definition of racial discrimination does not make any distinction between discrimination based on ethnicity and race in part because the distinction between the two has been a matter of debate among academics including anthropologists 91 27 93 similarly in british law the phrase racial group means any group of people who are defined by reference to their race colour nationality including citizenship or ethnic or national origin 91 28 93 in norway the word race has been removed from national laws concerning discrimination because the use of the phrase is considered problematic and unethical 91 29 93 91 30 93 the norwegian anti discrimination act bans discrimination based on ethnicity national origin descent and skin color 91 31 93 social and behavioral sciences main article sociology of race and ethnic relations sociologists in general recognize race as a social construct this means that although the concepts of race and racism are based on observable biological characteristics any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies racism as an ideology exists in a society at both the individual and institutional level while much of the research and work on racism during the last half century or so has concentrated on white racism in the western world historical accounts of race based social practices can be found across the globe 91 32 93 thus racism can be broadly defined to encompass individual and group prejudices and acts of discrimination that result in material and cultural advantages conferred on a majority or a dominant social group 91 33 93 so called white racism focuses on societies in which white populations are the majority or the dominant social group in studies of these majority white societies the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed white privilege race and race relations are prominent areas of study in sociology and economics much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism some of the earliest sociological works on racism were penned by sociologist w e b du bois the first african american to earn a doctoral degree from harvard university du bois wrote t he problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line 91 34 93 wellman 1993 defines racism as culturally sanctioned beliefs which regardless of intentions involved defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities 91 35 93 in both sociology and economics the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the inequality in income wealth net worth and access to other cultural resources such as education between racial groups 91 36 93 in sociology and social psychology racial identity and the acquisition of that identity is often used as a variable in racism studies racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals perception of race and discrimination cazenave and maddern 1999 define racism as a highly organized system of race based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color race supremacy racial centrality the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals racial identity appears to affect the degree of discrimination african american young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination 91 37 93 sellers and shelton 2003 found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs 91 38 93 some sociologists also argue that particularly in the west where racism is often negatively sanctioned in society racism has changed from being a blatant to a more covert expression of racial prejudice the newer more hidden and less easily detectable forms of racism which can be considered embedded in social processes and structures are more difficult to explore and challenge it has been suggested that while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly taboo even among those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes an implicit or aversive racism is still maintained subconsciously 91 39 93 this process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes a component of implicit cognition implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self these evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable they come about from various influences in the individual experience 91 40 93 implicit attitudes are not consciously identified or they are inaccurately identified traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feelings thoughts or actions towards social objects 91 39 93 these feelings thoughts or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware 91 41 93 therefore subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors in thinking about crime for example social psychologist jennifer l eberhardt 2004 of stanford university holds that blackness is so associated with crime you re ready to pick out these crime objects 91 42 93 such exposures influence our minds and they can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even towards objects thus racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware 91 43 93 for example scientists and activists have warned that the use of the stereotype nigerian prince for referring to advance fee scammers is racist i e reducing nigeria to a nation of scammers and fraudulent princes as some people still do online is a stereotype that needs to be called out 91 44 93 humanities language linguistics and discourse are active areas of study in the humanities along with literature and the arts discourse analysis seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study of the ways in which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works for example van dijk 1992 examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims 91 45 93 he notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority and especially for white elites they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt the previously cited book the souls of black folk by w e b du bois represents early african american literature that describes the author s experiences with racism when he was traveling in the south as an african american much american fictional literature has focused on issues of racism and the black racial experience in the us including works written by whites such as uncle tom s cabin to kill a mockingbird and imitation of life or even the non fiction work black like me these books and others like them feed into what has been called the white savior narrative in film in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters textual analysis of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors descriptions of african americans and their experiences in us society african american writers have sometimes been portrayed in african american studies as retreating from racial issues when they write about whiteness while others identify this as an african american literary tradition called the literature of white estrangement part of a multi pronged effort to challenge and dismantle white supremacy in the us 91 46 93 popular usage according to dictionaries the word is commonly used to describe prejudice and discrimination based on race 91 47 93 91 48 93 racism can also be said to describe a condition in society in which a dominant racial group benefits from the oppression of others whether that group wants such benefits or not 91 49 93 foucauldian scholar ladelle mcwhorter in her 2009 book racism and sexual oppression in anglo america a genealogy posits modern racism similarly focusing on the notion of a dominant group usually whites vying for racial purity and progress rather than an overt or obvious ideology focused on the oppression of nonwhites 91 50 93 in popular usage as in some academic usage little distinction is made between racism and ethnocentrism often the two are listed together as racial and ethnic in describing some action or outcome that is associated with prejudice within a majority or dominant group in society furthermore the meaning of the term racism is often conflated with the terms prejudice bigotry and discrimination racism is a complex concept that can involve each of those but it cannot be equated with nor is it synonymous with these other terms 91 citation needed 93 the term is often used in relation to what is seen as prejudice within a minority or subjugated group as in the concept of reverse racism reverse racism is a concept often used to describe acts of discrimination or hostility against members of a dominant racial or ethnic group while favoring members of minority groups 91 51 93 91 52 93 this concept has been used especially in the united states in debates over color conscious policies such as affirmative action intended to remedy racial inequalities 91 53 93 however many experts and other commenters view reverse racism as a myth rather than a reality 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 91 57 93 scholars commonly define racism not only in terms of individual prejudice but also in terms of a power structure that protects the interests of the dominant culture and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities 91 51 93 91 52 93 from this perspective while members of ethnic minorities may be prejudiced against members of the dominant culture they lack the political and economic power to actively oppress them and they are therefore not practicing racism 91 1 93 91 51 93 91 58 93 aspects the examples

new section as appropriate may 2022 learn how and when to remove this template message the ideology underlying racism can manifest in many aspects of social life such aspects are described in this section although the list is not exhaustive aversive racism main article aversive racism aversive racism is a form of implicit racism in which a person s unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups as opposed to traditional overt racism which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial ethnic minorities aversive racism is characterized by more complex ambivalent expressions and attitudes 91 59 93 aversive racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism described below which is also a form of implicit unconscious or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination the term was coined by joel kovel to describe the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes 91 59 93 people who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs and will often deny their racially motivated behavior nevertheless they change their behavior when dealing with a member of another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to the motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of aversive racism aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment in legal decisions and in helping behavior 91 60 93 91 61 93 color blindness main article color blindness race in relation to racism color blindness is the disregard of racial characteristics in social interaction for example in the rejection of affirmative action as a way to address the results of past patterns of discrimination critics of this attitude argue that by refusing to attend to racial disparities racial color blindness in fact unconsciously perpetuates the patterns that produce racial inequality 91 62 93 eduardo bonilla silva argues that color blind racism arises from an abstract liberalism biologization of culture naturalization of racial matters and minimization of racism 91 63 93 color blind practices are subtle institutional and apparently nonracial 91 64 93 because race is explicitly ignored in decision making if race is disregarded in predominantly white populations for example whiteness becomes the normative standard whereas people of color are othered and the racism these individuals experience may be minimized or erased 91 65 93 91 66 93 at an individual level people with color blind prejudice reject racist ideology but also reject systemic policies intended to fix institutional racism 91 66 93 cultural see also cultural racism and xenophobia cultural racism manifests as societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture including the language and traditions of that culture are superior to those of other cultures it shares a great deal with xenophobia which is often characterized by fear of or aggression toward members of an outgroup by members of an ingroup 91 citation needed 93 in that sense it is also similar to communalism as used in south asia 91 67 93 cultural racism exists when there is a widespread acceptance of stereotypes concerning diverse ethnic or population groups 91 68 93 whereas racism can be characterised by the belief that one race is inherently superior to another cultural racism can be characterised by the belief that one culture is inherently superior to another 91 69 93 economic further information racial wage gap in the united states and racial wealth gap in the united states historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of discrimination caused by past racism and historical reasons affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generations and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population economic discrimination may lead to choices that perpetuate racism for example color photographic film was tuned for white skin 91 70 93 as are automatic soap dispensers 91 71 93 and facial recognition systems 91 72 93 in 2011 bank of america agreed to pay 335 160 million to settle a federal government claim that its mortgage division countrywide financial discriminated against black and hispanic homebuyers 91 73 93 institutional further information institutional racism state racism racial profiling and racism by country african american university student vivian malone entering the university of alabama in the u s to register for classes as one of the first african american students to attend the institution until 1963 the university was racially segregated and african american students were not allowed to attend institutional racism also known as structural racism state racism or systemic racism is racial discrimination by governments corporations religions or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals stokely carmichael is credited for coining the phrase institutional racism in the late 1960s he defined the term as the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour culture or ethnic origin 91 74 93 maulana karenga argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture language religion and human possibility and that the effects of racism were the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining african humanity to the world poisoning past present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples 91 75 93 othering main article othering othering is the term used by some to describe a system of discrimination whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm 91 76 93 othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuation of racism to objectify a culture as something different exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like normal society europe s colonial attitude towards the orientals exemplifies this as it was thought that the east was the opposite of the west feminine where the west was masculine weak where the west was strong and traditional where the west was progressive 91 77 93 by making these generalizations and othering the east europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm further entrenching the gap 91 78 93 much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference or the expectation of difference spatial difference can be enough to conclude that we are here and the others are over there 91 77 93 imagined differences serve to categorize people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer s expectations 91 79 93 racial discrimination main article racial discrimination racial discrimination refers to discrimination against someone on the basis of their race racial segregation main article racial segregation external video james a white sr the little problem i had renting a house ted talks 14 20 february 20 2015 racial segregation is the separation of humans into socially constructed racial groups in daily life it may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant drinking from a water fountain using a bathroom attending school going to the movies or in the rental or purchase of a home 91 80 93 segregation is generally outlawed but may exist through social norms even when there is no strong individual preference for it as suggested by thomas schelling s models of segregation and subsequent work supremacism main article supremacism in 1899 uncle sam a personification of the united states balances his new possessions which are depicted as savage children the figures are puerto rico hawaii cuba philippines and ladrones the mariana islands centuries of european colonialism in the americas africa and asia were often justified by white supremacist attitudes 91 81 93 during the early 20th century the phrase the white man s burden was widely used to justify an imperialist policy as a noble enterprise 91 82 93 91 83 93 a justification for the policy of conquest and subjugation of native americans emanated from the stereotyped perceptions of the indigenous people as merciless indian savages as they are described in the united states declaration of independence 91 84 93 sam wolfson of the guardian writes that the declaration s passage has often been cited as an encapsulation of the dehumanizing attitude toward indigenous americans that the us was founded on 91 85 93 in an 1890 article about colonial expansion onto native american land author l frank baum wrote the whites by law of conquest by justice of civilization are masters of the american continent and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining indians 91 86 93 in his notes on the state of virginia published in 1785 thomas jefferson wrote blacks whether originally a distinct race or made distinct by time or circumstances are inferior to the whites in the endowments of both body and mind 91 87 93 attitudes of black supremacy arab supremacy and east asian supremacy also exist symbolic modern main article symbolic racism a rally against school integration in little rock arkansas 1959 some scholars argue that in the us earlier violent and aggressive forms of racism have evolved into a more subtle form of prejudice in the late 20th century this new form of racism is sometimes referred to as modern racism and it is characterized by outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes displaying subtle prejudiced behaviors such as actions informed by attributing qualities to others based on racial stereotypes and evaluating the same behavior differently based on the race of the person being evaluated 91 88 93 this view is based on studies of prejudice and discriminatory behavior where some people will act ambivalently towards black people with positive reactions in certain more public contexts but more negative views and expressions in more private contexts this ambivalence may also be visible for example in hiring decisions where job candidates that are otherwise positively evaluated may be unconsciously disfavored by employers in the final decision because of their race 91 89 93 91 90 93 91 91 93 some scholars consider modern racism to be characterized by an explicit rejection of stereotypes combined with resistance to changing structures of discrimination for reasons that are ostensibly non racial an ideology that considers opportunity at a purely individual basis denying the relevance of race in determining individual opportunities and the exhibition of indirect forms of micro aggression toward and or avoidance of people of other races 91 92 93 subconscious biases main article implicit bias 160 racial bias recent research has shown that individuals who consciously claim to reject racism may still exhibit race based subconscious biases in their decision making processes while such subconscious racial biases do not fully fit the definition of racism their impact can be similar though typically less pronounced not being explicit conscious or deliberate 91 93 93 international law and racial discrimination in 1919 a proposal to include a racial equality provision in the covenant of the league of nations was supported by a majority but not adopted in the paris peace conference in 1919 in 1943 japan and its allies declared work for the abolition of racial discrimination to be their aim at the greater east asia conference 91 94 93 article 1 of the 1945 un charter includes promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race as un purpose in 1950 unesco suggested in the race question a statement signed by 21 scholars such as ashley montagu claude l vi strauss gunnar myrdal julian huxley etc to drop the term race altogether and instead speak of ethnic groups the statement condemned scientific racism theories that had played a role in the holocaust it aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories by popularizing modern knowledge concerning the race question and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the enlightenment and its assumption of equal rights for all along with myrdal s an american dilemma the negro problem and modern democracy 1944 the race question influenced the 1954 u s supreme court desegregation decision in brown v board of education 91 95 93 also in 1950 the european convention on human rights was adopted which was widely used on racial discrimination issues 91 96 93 the united nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination adopted in 1966 91 97 93 160 any distinction exclusion restriction or preference based on race color descent or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life part 1 of article 1 of the u n international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination in 2001 the european union explicitly banned racism along with many other forms of social discrimination in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the legal effect of which if any would necessarily be limited to institutions of the european union article 21 of the charter prohibits discrimination on any ground such as race color ethnic or social origin genetic features language religion or belief political or any other opinion membership of a national minority property disability age or sexual orientation and also discrimination on the grounds of nationality 91 98 93 ideology a pro hiester clymer racist political campaign poster from the 1866 pennsylvania gubernatorial election racism existed during the 19th century as scientific racism which attempted to provide a racial classification of humanity 91 99 93 in 1775 johann blumenbach divided the world s population into five groups according to skin color caucasians mongols etc positing the view that the non caucasians had arisen through a process of degeneration another early view in scientific racism was the polygenist view which held that the different races had been separately created polygenist christoph meiners for example split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the beautiful white race and the ugly black race in meiners book the outline of history of mankind he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness he viewed only the white race as beautiful he considered ugly races to be inferior immoral and animal like anders retzius demonstrated that neither europeans nor others are one pure race but of mixed origins while discredited derivations of blumenbach s taxonomy are still widely used for the classification of the population in the united states hans peder steensby while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time and conjectured that the purest race today would be the australian aboriginals 91 100 93 a sign on a racially segregated beach during apartheid in south africa stating that the area is for the sole use of members of the white race group scientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th century but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within academia in fields such as human genetics including paleogenetics social anthropology comparative politics history of religions history of ideas prehistory history ethics and psychiatry there is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to blumenbach s races it is more unclear to which extent and when ethnic and national stereotypes are accepted although after world war ii and the holocaust racist ideologies were discredited on ethical political and scientific grounds racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world du bois observed that it is not so much race that we think about but culture 160 a common history common laws and religion similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life 91 101 93 late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on race ethnicity and survival of the fittest to shape new nationalist doctrines ultimately race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation 91 102 93 according to this view culture is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings as such fully determined by racial characteristics culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised such as blondness racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics in the case of nordicism the denomination germanic was equivalent to superiority of race bolstered by some nationalist and ethnocentric values and achievements of choice this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure this emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism r acism does not originate from the existence of races it creates them through a process of social division into categories anybody can be racialised independently of their somatic cultural religious differences 91 103 93 this definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race which is still subject to scientific debate in the words of david c rowe a racial concept although sometimes in the guise of another name will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists as well as lay persons are fascinated by human diversity some of which is captured by race 91 104 93 racial prejudice became subject to international legislation for instance the declaration on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination adopted by the united nations general assembly on november 20 1963 addresses racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race colour or ethnic origin article i 91 105 93 ethnicity and ethnic conflicts further information ethnicity a mass grave being dug for frozen bodies from the 1890 wounded knee massacre in which the u s army killed 150 lakota people marking the end of the american indian wars debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term many use the term racism to refer to more general phenomena such as xenophobia and ethnocentrism although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an ideology or from scientific racism which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict in most cases ethno national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources in some cases ethnicity and nationalism were harnessed in order to rally combatants in wars between great religious empires for example the muslim turks and the catholic austro hungarians notions of race and racism have often played central roles in ethnic conflicts throughout history when an adversary is identified as other based on notions of race or ethnicity in particular when other is interpreted to mean inferior the means employed by the self presumed superior party to appropriate territory human chattel or material wealth often have been more ruthless more brutal and less constrained by moral or ethical considerations according to historian daniel richter pontiac s rebellion saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of the novel idea that all native people were indians that all euro americans were whites and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other 91 106 93 basil davidson states in his documentary africa different but equal that racism in fact only just recently surfaced as late as the 19th century due to the need for a justification for slavery in the americas historically racism was a major driving force behind the transatlantic slave trade 91 107 93 it was also a major force behind racial segregation especially in the united states in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and south africa under apartheid 19th and 20th century racism in the western world is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism 91 8 93 racism has played a role in genocides such as the armenian genocide and the holocaust and colonial projects like the european colonization of the americas africa and asia indigenous peoples have been and are often subject to racist attitudes practices and ideologies of racism are condemned by the united nations in the declaration of human rights 91 108 93 ethnic and racial nationalism further information ethnic nationalism racial nationalism and romantic nationalism a 1917 anti conscription propaganda leaflet imploring voters to keep australia white a horde of asians bearing a dragon flag is shown to the north after the napoleonic wars europe was confronted with the new nationalities question leading to reconfigurations of the european map on which the frontiers between the states had been delineated during the 1648 peace of westphalia nationalism had made its first appearance with the invention of the lev e en masse by the french revolutionaries thus inventing mass conscription in order to be able to defend the newly founded republic against the ancien r gime order represented by the european monarchies this led to the french revolutionary wars 1792 1802 and then to the conquests of napoleon and to the subsequent european wide debates on the concepts and realities of nations and in particular of nation states the westphalia treaty had divided europe into various empires and kingdoms such as the ottoman empire the holy roman empire the swedish empire the kingdom of france etc and for centuries wars were waged between princes kabinettskriege in german modern nation states appeared in the wake of the french revolution with the formation of patriotic sentiments for the first time in spain during the peninsula war 1808 1813 known in spain as the independence war despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 congress of vienna the nationalities question became the main problem of europe during the industrial era leading in particular to the 1848 revolutions the italian unification completed during the 1871 franco prussian war which itself culminated in the proclamation of the german empire in the hall of mirrors in the palace of versailles thus achieving the german unification meanwhile the ottoman empire the sick man of europe was confronted with endless nationalist movements which along with the dissolving of the austrian hungarian empire would lead to the creation after world war i of the various nation states of the balkans with national minorities in their borders 91 109 93 ethnic nationalism which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation states one of its main influences was the romantic nationalist movement at the turn of the 19th century represented by figures such as johann herder 1744 1803 johan fichte 1762 1814 in the addresses to the german nation 1808 friedrich hegel 1770 1831 or also in france jules michelet 1798 1874 it was opposed to liberal nationalism represented by authors such as ernest renan 1823 1892 who conceived of the nation as a community which instead of being based on the volk ethnic group and on a specific common language was founded on the subjective will to live together the nation is a daily plebiscite 1882 or also john stuart mill 1806 1873 91 110 93 ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses as well as with continental imperialist hannah arendt 1951 91 111 93 discourses for example in the pan germanism discourses which postulated the racial superiority of the german volk people folk the pan german league alldeutscher verband created in 1891 promoted german imperialism and racial hygiene and was opposed to intermarriage with jews another popular current the v lkisch movement was also an important proponent of the german ethnic nationalist discourse and it combined pan germanism with modern racial antisemitism members of the v lkisch movement in particular the thule society would participate in the founding of the german workers party dap in munich in 1918 the predecessor of the nazi party pan germanism played a decisive role in the interwar period of the 1920s 1930s 91 111 93 these currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a master race often the aryan race or the nordic race issued from the scientific racist discourse they conflated nationalities with ethnic groups called races in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a race struggle inside the nation and the state itself furthermore they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups thus justifying ethnic cleansing in order to achieve racial purity and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation state such racist discourses combined with nationalism were not however limited to pan germanism in france the transition from republican liberal nationalism to ethnic nationalism which made nationalism a characteristic of far right movements in france took place during the dreyfus affair at the end of the 19th century during several years a nationwide crisis affected french society concerning the alleged treason of alfred dreyfus a french jewish military officer the country polarized itself into two opposite camps one represented by mile zola who wrote j accuse in defense of alfred dreyfus and the other represented by the nationalist poet maurice barr s 1862 1923 one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in france 91 112 93 at the same time charles maurras 1868 1952 founder of the monarchist action fran aise movement theorized the anti france composed of the four confederate states of protestants jews freemasons and foreigners his actual word for the latter being the pejorative m t ques indeed to him the first three were all internal foreigners who threatened the ethnic unity of the french people history history of racism redirects here for racism concept in history see historical race concepts ethnocentrism and proto racism the book of genesis s biblical curse on canaan which was often misinterpreted as a curse on his father ham was used to justify slavery in 19th century america 91 113 93 aristotle bernard lewis has cited the greek philosopher aristotle who in his discussion of slavery stated that while greeks are free by nature barbarians non greeks are slaves by nature in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to a despotic government 91 114 93 though aristotle does not specify any particular races he argues that people from nations outside greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from greece 91 115 93 while aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls unfit for rule unintelligent which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies do not always go together implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul not the body 91 116 93 this proto racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist benjamin isaac such proto racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context because a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority with modern racism based on eugenics and scientific racism was not yet developed and it is unclear whether aristotle believed the natural inferiority of barbarians was caused by environment and climate like many of his contemporaries or by birth 91 117 93 historian dante a puzzo in his discussion of aristotle racism and the ancient world writes that 91 118 93 racism rests on two basic assumptions that a correlation exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks racism thus defined is a modern conception for prior to the xvith century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the west that can be described as racist to prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and ethnocentrism 160 the ancient hebrews in referring to all who were not hebrews as gentiles were indulging in ethnocentrism not in racism 160 so it was with the hellenes who denominated all non hellenes whether the wild scythians or the egyptians whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of civilization barbarians the term denoting that which was strange or foreign medieval arab writers see also medieval arab attitudes to black people bernard lewis has also cited historians and geographers of the middle east and north africa region 91 119 93 including al muqaddasi al jahiz al masudi abu rayhan biruni nasir al din al tusi and ibn qutaybah 91 119 93 though the qur an expresses no racial prejudice lewis argues that ethnocentric prejudice later developed among arabs for a variety of reasons 91 119 93 their extensive conquests and slave trade the influence of aristotelian ideas regarding slavery which some muslim philosophers directed towards zanj bantu 91 120 93 and turkic peoples 91 114 93 and the influence of judeo christian ideas regarding divisions among humankind 91 121 93 by the eighth century anti black prejudice among arabs resulted in discrimination a number of medieval arabic authors argued against this prejudice urging respect for all black people and especially ethiopians 91 122 93 by the 14th century a significant number of slaves came from sub saharan africa lewis argues that this led to the likes of egyptian historian al abshibi 1388 1446 writing that i t is said that when the black slave is sated he fornicates when he is hungry he steals 91 123 93 according to lewis the 14th century tunisian scholar ibn khaldun also wrote 91 119 93 91 124 93 beyond known peoples of black west africa to the south there is no civilization in the proper sense there are only humans who are closer to dumb animals than to rational beings they live in thickets and caves and eat herbs and unprepared grain they frequently eat each other they cannot be considered human beings therefore the negro nations are as a rule submissive to slavery because negroes have little that is essentially human and possess attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals as we have stated according to wesleyan university professor abdelmajid hannoum french orientalists projected racist and colonialist views of the 19th century into their translations of medieval arabic writings including those of ibn khaldun this resulted in the translated texts racializing arabs and berber people when no such distinction was made in the originals 91 125 93 james e lindsay argues that the concept of an arab identity itself did not exist until modern times 91 126 93 though others like robert hoyland have argued that a common sense of arab identity already existed by the 9th century 91 127 93 limpieza de sangre further information limpieza de sangre with the umayyad caliphate s conquest of hispania muslim arabs and berbers overthrew the previous visigothic rulers and created al andalus 91 128 93 which contributed to the golden age of jewish culture and lasted for six centuries 91 129 93 it was followed by the centuries long reconquista 91 130 93 during which christian iberian kingdoms contested al andalus and progressively conquered the divided muslim kingdoms culminating in the fall of the nasrid kingdom of granada in 1492 and the rise of ferdinand v and isabella i as catholic monarchs of spain the legacy catholic spaniards then formulated the limpieza de sangre cleanliness of blood doctrine it was during this time in history that the western concept of aristocratic blue blood emerged in a racialized religious and feudal context 91 131 93 so as to stem the upward social mobility of the converted new christians robert lacey explains 91 132 93 it was the spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat s blood is not red but blue the spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion occupying land as warriors on horseback they were to continue the process for more than five hundred years clawing back sections of the peninsula from its moorish occupiers and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue blooded veins beneath his pale skin proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark skinned enemy sangre azul blue blood was thus a euphemism for being a white man spain s own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism following the expulsion of the arabic moors and most of the sephardic jews from the iberian peninsula the remaining jews and muslims were forced to convert to roman catholicism becoming new christians who were sometimes discriminated against by the old christians in some cities including toledo despite condemnations by the church and the state which both welcomed the new flock 91 131 93 the inquisition was carried out by members of the dominican order in order to weed out the converts who still practiced judaism and islam in secret the system and ideology of the limpieza de sangre ostracized false christian converts from society in order to protect it against treason 91 133 93 the remnants of such legislation persevered into the 19th century in military contexts 91 134 93 in portugal the legal distinction between new and old christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the marquis of pombal in 1772 almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination the limpieza de sangre legislation was common also during the colonization of the americas where it led to the racial and feudal separation of peoples and social strata in the colonies it was however often ignored in practice as the new colonies needed skilled people 91 135 93 a 16th century illustration by flemish protestant theodor de bry for las casas s brevisima relaci n de la destrucci n de las indias depicting spanish atrocities during the conquest of cuba at the end of the renaissance the valladolid debate 1550 1551 concerning the treatment of the natives of the new world pitted the dominican friar and bishop of chiapas bartolom de las casas to another dominican and humanist philosopher juan gin s de sep lveda the latter argued that the indians practiced human sacrifice of innocents cannibalism and other such crimes against nature they were unacceptable and should be suppressed by any means possible including war 91 136 93 thus reducing them to slavery or serfdom was in accordance with catholic theology and natural law to the contrary bartolom de las casas argued that the amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others according to catholic theology it was one of the many controversies concerning racism slavery religion and european morality that would arise in the following centuries and which resulted in the legislation protecting the natives 91 137 93 the marriage between luisa de abrego a free black domestic servant from seville and miguel rodr guez a white segovian conquistador in 1565 in st augustine spanish florida is the first known and recorded christian marriage anywhere in the continental united states 91 138 93 in the spanish colonies spaniards developed a complex caste system based on race which was used for social control and which also determined a person s importance in society 91 139 93 while many latin american countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation usually at the time of their independence prejudice based on degrees of perceived racial distance from european ancestry combined with one s socioeconomic status remain an echo of the colonial caste system 91 140 93 racism as a modern phenomenon although antisemitism has a long history related to christianity and native egyptian or greek religions 91 141 93 anti judaism racism itself is sometimes described as a modern phenomenon in the view of the french philosopher and historian michel foucault the first formulation of racism emerged in the early modern period as the discourse of race struggle and a historical and political discourse which foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of sovereignty 91 142 93 on the other hand e g chinese self identification as a yellow race predated such european racial concepts 91 citation needed 93 this european analysis which first appeared in great britain was then carried on in france by such people as boulainvilliers nicolas fr ret and then during the 1789 french revolution siey s and afterwards augustin thierry and cournot boulainvilliers who created the matrix of such racist discourse in medieval france conceived of the race as being something closer to the sense of a nation that is in his time the race meant the people he conceived of france as being divided between various nations the unified nation state is an anachronism here which themselves formed different races boulainvilliers opposed the absolute monarchy which tried to bypass the aristocracy by establishing a direct relationship to the third estate thus he developed the theory that the french aristocrats were the descendants of foreign invaders whom he called the franks while according to him the third estate constituted the autochthonous vanquished gallo romans who were dominated by the frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the right of conquest early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation state the comte de montlosier in exile during the french revolution who borrowed boulainvilliers discourse on the nordic race as being the french aristocracy that invaded the plebeian gauls thus showed his contempt for the third estate calling it this new people born of slaves 160 mixture of all races and of all times 19th century advertisement for pears soap caption reads matchless for the complexion illustration of before and after use of soap by black child in the bath soap washes off his dark complexion while 19th century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism 91 143 93 leading to the ethnic nationalist discourse that identified the race with the folk leading to such movements as pan germanism pan turkism pan arabism and pan slavism medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non biological races which were thought to be the consequence of historical conquests and social conflicts michel foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval historical and political discourse of race struggle according to him it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines on one hand it was incorporated by racists biologists and eugenicists who gave it the modern sense of race and they also transformed this popular discourse into a state racism e g nazism on the other hand marxism also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real engine of history and continued to act underneath the apparent peace thus marxists transformed the essentialist notion of race into the historical notion of class struggle defined by socially structured positions capitalist or proletarian in the will to knowledge 1976 foucault analyzed another opponent of the race struggle discourse sigmund freud s psychoanalysis which opposed the concept of blood heredity prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse authors such as hannah arendt in her 1951 book the origins of totalitarianism have said that the racist ideology popular racism which developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the imperialist conquests of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them such as the herero and namaqua genocide of 1904 1907 or the armenian genocide of 1915 1917 rudyard kipling s poem the white man s burden 1899 is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the european culture over the rest of the world though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs a late 19th century illustration from ireland from one or two neglected points of view by h strickland constable shows an alleged similarity between irish iberian and negro features in contrast to the higher anglo teutonic however during the 19th century western european colonial powers were involved in the suppression of the arab slave trade in africa 91 144 93 as well as in the suppression of the slave trade in west africa 91 145 93 some europeans during the time period objected to injustices that occurred in some colonies and lobbied on behalf of aboriginal peoples thus when the hottentot venus was

of darkness 1899 a clear criticism of the congo free state which was owned by leopold ii of belgium examples of racial theories used include the creation of the hamitic ethno linguistic group during the european exploration of africa it was then restricted by karl friedrich lepsius 1810 1877 to non semitic afro asiatic languages 91 146 93 the term hamite was applied to different populations within north africa mainly comprising ethiopians eritreans somalis berbers and the ancient egyptians hamites were regarded as caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either arabia or asia on the basis of their cultural physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas 91 147 93 91 148 93 91 149 93 europeans considered hamites to be more civilized than sub saharan africans and more akin to themselves and semitic peoples 91 150 93 in the first two thirds of the 20th century the hamitic race was in fact considered one of the branches of the caucasian race along with the indo europeans semites and the mediterraneans however the hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers which was usually ascribed to interbreeding with negroes in the mid 20th century the german scholar carl meinhof 1857 1944 claimed that the bantu race was formed by a merger of hamitic and negro races the hottentots nama or khoi were formed by the merger of hamitic and bushmen san races both being termed nowadays as khoisan peoples one in a series of posters attacking radical republicans on the issue of black suffrage issued during the pennsylvania gubernatorial election of 1866 in the united states in the early 19th century the american colonization society was established as the primary vehicle for proposals to return black americans to greater freedom and equality in africa 91 151 93 the colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder henry clay stating that unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country it was desirable therefore as it respected them and the residue of the population of the country to drain them off 91 152 93 racism spread throughout

black people ranked between white people and chimpanzees in terms of intelligence the modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories the term scientific racism refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs which goes back to the early 18th century though it gained most of its influence in the mid 19th century during the new imperialism period also known as academic racism such theories first needed to overcome the church s resistance to positivist accounts of history and its support of monogenism the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors in accordance with creationist accounts of history these racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with unilineal theories of social progress which postulated the superiority of the european civilization over the rest of the world furthermore they frequently made use of the idea of survival of the fittest a term coined by herbert spencer in 1864 associated with ideas of competition which were named social darwinism in the 1940s charles darwin himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in the descent of man 1871 in which he argued that humans were all of one species sharing common descent he recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties tastes dispositions and habits while still contrasting the culture of the lowest savages with european civilization 91 238 93 91 239 93 at the end of the 19th century proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with eugenics discourses of degeneration of the race and blood heredity 91 citation needed 93 henceforth scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism unilinealism social darwinism and eugenism they found their scientific legitimacy on physical anthropology anthropometry craniometry phrenology physiognomy and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices before being disqualified in the 20th century by the american school of cultural anthropology franz boas etc the british school of social anthropology bronis aw malinowski alfred radcliffe brown etc the french school of ethnology claude l vi strauss etc as well as the discovery of the neo darwinian synthesis such sciences in particular anthropometry were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward physical appearances the neo darwinian synthesis first developed in the 1930s eventually led to a gene centered view of evolution in the 1960s according to the human genome project the most complete mapping of human dna to date indicates that there is no clear genetic basis to racial groups while some genes are more common in certain populations there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other 91 240 93 heredity and eugenics further information eugenics the first theory of eugenics was developed in 1869 by francis galton 1822 1911 who used the then popular concept of degeneration he applied statistics to study human differences and the alleged inheritance of intelligence foreshadowing future uses of intelligence testing by the anthropometry school such theories were vividly described by the writer mile zola 1840 1902 who started publishing in 1871 a twenty novel cycle les rougon macquart where he linked heredity to behavior thus zola described the high born rougons as those involved in politics son excellence eug ne rougon and medicine le docteur pascal and the low born macquarts as those fatally falling into alcoholism l assommoir prostitution nana and homicide la b te humaine during the rise of nazism in germany some scientists in western nations worked to debunk the regime s racial theories a few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races however in the fields of anthropology and biology these were minority positions until the mid 20th century 91 241 93 according to the 1950 unesco statement the race question an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid 1930s however this project had been abandoned thus in 1950 unesco declared that it had resumed up again after a lapse of fifteen years a project that the international committee on intellectual cooperation has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the appeasement policy of the pre war period the race question had become one of the pivots of nazi ideology and policy masaryk and bene took the initiative of calling for a conference to re establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race 160 nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation the third reich s racial policies its eugenics programs and the extermination of jews in the holocaust as well as the romani people in the porrajmos the romani holocaust and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war 91 citation needed 93 changes within scientific disciplines such as the rise of the boasian school of anthropology in the united states contributed to this shift these theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 unesco statement signed by internationally renowned scholars and titled the race question polygenism and racial typologies further information polygenism typology anthropology and nordicism madison grant s map from 1916 charting the present distribution of european races with the nordics in red the alpines in green and the mediterraneans in yellow works such as arthur de gobineau s an essay on the inequality of the human races 1853 1855 may be considered one of the first theorizations of this new racism founded on an essentialist notion of race which opposed the former racial discourse of boulainvilliers for example which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality which changed over time gobineau thus attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans giving it the legitimacy of biology gobineau s theories would be expanded in france by georges vacher de lapouge 1854 1936 s typology of races who published in 1899 the aryan and his social role in which he claimed that the white aryan race dolichocephalic was opposed to the brachycephalic race of whom the jew was the archetype vacher de lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races in which he identified the homo europaeus teutonic protestant etc the homo alpinus auvergnat turkish etc and finally the homo mediterraneus neapolitan andalus etc he assimilated races and social classes considering that the french upper class was a representation of the homo europaeus while the lower class represented the homo alpinus applying galton s eugenics to his theory of races vacher de lapouge s selectionism aimed first at achieving the annihilation of trade unionists considered to be a degenerate second creating types of man each destined to one end in order to prevent any contestation of labour conditions his anthroposociology thus aimed at blocking social conflict by establishing a fixed hierarchical social order 91 242 93 the same year william z ripley used identical racial classification in the races of europe 1899 which would have a great influence in the united states other scientific authors include h s chamberlain at the end of the 19th century a british citizen who naturalized himself as german because of his admiration for the aryan race and madison grant a eugenicist and author of the passing of the great race 1916 madison grant provided statistics for the immigration act of 1924 which severely restricted immigration of jews slavs and southern europeans who were subsequently hindered in seeking to escape nazi germany 91 243 93 human zoos human zoos called people shows were an important means of bolstering popular racism by connecting it to scientific racism they were both objects of public curiosity and of anthropology and anthropometry 91 244 93 91 245 93 joice heth an african american slave was displayed by p t barnum in 1836 a few years after the exhibition of saartjie baartman the hottentot venus in england such exhibitions became common in the new imperialism period and remained so until world war ii carl hagenbeck inventor of the modern zoos exhibited animals beside humans who were considered savages 91 246 93 91 247 93 congolese pygmy ota benga was displayed in 1906 by eugenicist madison grant head of the bronx zoo as an attempt to illustrate the missing link between humans and orangutans thus racism was tied to darwinism creating a social darwinist ideology that tried to ground itself in darwin s scientific discoveries the 1931 paris colonial exhibition displayed kanaks from new caledonia 91 248 93 a congolese village was on display as late as 1958 at the brussels world fair theories about the origins of racism see also ethnocentrism and tribalism sociological model of ethnic and racial conflict evolutionary psychologists john tooby and leda cosmides were puzzled by the fact that in the us race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals the others are age and sex they reasoned that natural selection would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification because for most of human history humans almost never encountered members of other races tooby and cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy rough and ready indicator for coalition membership since a better than random guess about which side another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance their colleague robert kurzban designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis using the memory confusion protocol they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences allegedly spoken by these individuals which presented two sides of a debate the errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes mis attributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the correct speaker although they also sometimes mis attributed a statement to a speaker on the same side as the correct speaker in a second run of the experiment the team also distinguished the sides in the debate by clothing of similar colors and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished being replaced by the color of their clothing in other words the first group of subjects with no clues from clothing used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue and the effect of race became very small 91 249 93 some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation political scientists ross hammond and robert axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors and then one of a variety of trading strategies be color blind favor those of your own color or favor those of other colors they found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together then grew until all the non ethnocentric individuals were wiped out 91 250 93 in the selfish gene evolutionary biologist richard dawkins writes that blood feuds and inter clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of hamilton s genetic theory dawkins writes that racial prejudice while not evolutionarily adaptive could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance 91 251 93 simulation based experiments in evolutionary game theory have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric strategy phenotypes 91 252 93 despite support for evolutionary theories relating to an innate origin of racism various studies have suggested racism is associated with lower intelligence and less diverse peer groups during childhood a neuroimaging study on amygdala activity during racial matching activities found increased activity to be associated with adolescent age as well as less racially diverse peer groups which the author conclude suggest a learned aspect of racism 91 253 93 a meta analysis of neuroimaging studies found amygdala activity correlated to increased scores on implicit measures of racial bias it was also argued amygdala activity in response to racial stimuli represents increased threat perception rather than the traditional theory of the amygdala activity represented ingroup outgroup processing 91 254 93 racism has

national party of south africa during its apartheid regime between 1948 and 1994 here a series of apartheid legislation was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white south africans to have rights which were superior to those of non white south africans non white south africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters including voting access to quality healthcare the provision of basic services including clean water electricity as well as access to adequate schooling non white south africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas from using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas non white south africans were taxed differently than white south africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times additional documentation which later became known as dom passes to certify their non white south african citizenship all of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a
