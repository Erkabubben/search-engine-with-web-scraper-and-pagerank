draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards jews once jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance without leaving behind the old christian hostility towards jews the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable even before explicitly racist doctrines appear 91 20 93 one of the first typologies which was used to classify various human races was invented by georges vacher de lapouge 1854 1936 a theoretician of eugenics who published l aryen et son r le social 1899 the aryan and his social role in 1899 in his book he divides humanity into various hierarchical races starting with the highest race which is the aryan white race dolichocephalic and ending with the lowest race which is the brachycephalic mediocre and inert race that race is best represented by southern european catholic peasants 91 21 93 between these vacher de lapouge identified the homo europaeus teutonic protestant etc the homo alpinus auvergnat turkish etc and finally the homo mediterraneus neapolitan andalus etc jews were brachycephalic just like the aryans were according to lapouge but he considered them dangerous for this exact reason they were the only group he thought which was threatening to displace the aryan aristocracy 91 22 93 vacher de lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of nazi antisemitism and nazi

political goal of creating a sovereign jewish state where jews could be the majority rather than the minority which they were in all nations of the world at that time theodor herzl the ideological father of zionism considered antisemitism to be an eternal feature of all societies in which jews lived as minorities and as a result he believed that only a separation could allow jews to escape eternal persecution let them give us sovereignty over a piece of the earth s surface just sufficient for the needs of our people then we will do the rest 91 54 93 since the 1990s 91 55 93 91 56 93

jewish people are god s chosen nation and racially superior to non jews 91 55 93 91 56 93 91 57 93 and mentor noahides because they believe that the messianic era will begin with the rebuilding of the

patriarchal beliefs assert the natural superiority of men with a right to leadership in family and public life such beliefs derive particularly from abrahamic religions patriarchal attitudes relating to sexual behaviour are mixed and inconsistent they include on one hand the idea that as part of their natural inferiority women are less in control of their sex drives and are therefore essentially lustful with a constant craving for sex this belief leads to the rape myth even when women resist sexual advances they are using it merely as a seductive device on the other hand patriarchal beliefs also dictate that women in contrast to men are naturally submissive and have little interest in sex so men have a natural right to sexual intercourse whether women want it or not peggy reeves sanday
