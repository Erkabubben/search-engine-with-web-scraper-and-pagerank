history of psychopathy from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search psychopathy from psych soul or mind and pathy suffering or disease was coined by german psychiatrists in the 19th century and originally just meant what would today be called mental disorder the study of which is still known as psychopathology by the turn of the century psychopathic inferiority referred to the type of mental disorder that might now be termed personality disorder along with a wide variety of other conditions now otherwise classified through the early 20th century this and other terms such as constitutional inborn psychopaths or psychopathic personalities were used very broadly to cover anyone who violated legal or moral expectations or was considered inherently socially undesirable in some way the term sociopathy was popularized from 1929 30 by the american psychologist george e partridge and was originally intended as an alternative term to indicate that the defining feature was a pervasive failure to adhere to societal norms in a way that could harm others the term psychopathy also gradually narrowed to the latter sense based on interpretations of the work of a scottish psychiatrist and especially checklists popularized by an american psychiatrist and later a canadian psychologist psychopathy became defined in these quarters as a constellation of personality traits allegedly associated with immorality criminality or in some cases socioeconomic success official psychiatric diagnostic manuals adopted a mixture of approaches eventually going by the term antisocial or dissocial personality disorder in the meantime concepts of psychopaths sociopaths had become notorious among the general public and as characters in fiction contents 1 early literature 2 early clinical concepts 3 first uses of term 4 early 20th century 5 mid 20th century 6 late 20th century 7 21st century 8 overall trends 9 see also 10 references early literature edit labels for personality and behavior patterns consistent with psychopathy exist in most cultures 91 1 93 in rural nigeria the term aranakan was used by the yoruba people to describe an individual who always goes his own way regardless of others who is uncooperative full of malice and bullheaded 91 2 93 similarly the word kunlangeta was used by the inuit to describe mind knows what to do but does not do it the psychiatric anthropologist jane m murphy writes that in northwest alaska the term kunlangeta might be applied to a man who repeatedly lies and cheats and steals things and does not go hunting and when the other men are out of the village takes sexual advantage of many women someone who does not pay attention to reprimands and who is always brought to the elders for punishment 91 3 93 historical descriptions of people or characters are sometimes noted in discussions of psychopathy with claims of superficial resemblance or retrospective diagnosis 8201 8201 for example a vignette by theophrastus in ancient greece concerning the unscrupulous man 91 4 93 on the other hand the ancient greek military statesman alcibiades has been described as the best example of a probable psychopath 160 due to inconsistent failures despite his potential and confident speaking 91 5 93 figures of insanity e g vagabonds libertines the mad have at least since the 18th century often represented an image of darkness and threat to society as later would the psychopath 160 a mixture of concepts of dangerousness evil and illness 91 6 93 early clinical concepts edit psychiatric concepts began to develop in the early 19th century which to some extent fed into the use of the term psychopathy from the late 19th century when that term still had a different and far broader meaning than today in 1801 french psychiatrist philippe pinel described without moral judgment patients who appeared mentally unimpaired but who nonetheless engaged in impulsive and self defeating acts he described this as insanity without confusion delusion manie sans d lire or rational insanity la folie raisonnante and his anecdotes generally described people carried away by instinctive fury instincte fureur american benjamin rush wrote in 1812 about individuals with an apparent perversion of the moral faculties which he saw as a sign of innate defective organization he also saw such people as objects of compassion whose mental alienation could be helped even if that was in prison or what he referred to as the christian system of criminal jurisprudence 91 7 93 in 1835 english psychiatrist james cowles prichard based partly on pinel s publications developed a broad category of mental disorder he called moral insanity a madness of emotional or social dispositions without significant delusions or hallucinations generally prichard referred more to eccentric behaviour than as had pinel out of control passions prichard s diagnosis came into widespread use in europe for several decades none of these concepts are comparable to current specific constructs of psychopathy or even to the broader category of personality disorders moreover moral did not necessarily refer at that time to morality but to the psychological or emotional faculties 91 8 93 in the latter half of the 19th century the pseudo scientific study of individuals thought to lack a conscience flourished notably the italian physician cesare lombroso rejected the view that criminality could occur in anyone and sought to identify particular born criminals who he thought showed certain physical signs such as proportionately long arms or a low and narrow forehead 91 9 93 91 10 93 by the beginning of the 20th century the english psychiatrist henry maudsley was writing about not just moral insanity but the moral imbecile and criminal psychosis conditions he believed were genetic in origin and impervious to punishment or correction and which he applied to the lower class of chronic offenders by comparison to the higher industrial classes 91 7 93 91 11 93 first uses of term edit initially physicians who specialised in mental disorders might be referred to as psychopaths e g the american journal of the medical sciences in 1864 and their hospitals as psychopathic institutions compare to the etymologically similar use of the term homeopathic treatments of physical conditions by psychological or spiritualist methods might be referred to as psychopathic 91 12 93 up until the 1840s the term psychopathy was also used in a way consistent with its etymology to refer to any illness of the mind german psychiatrist von feuchtersleben s 1845 the principles of medical psychology which was translated into english used it in this sense as well as the roughly equivalent new term psychosis now traced back to karl friedrich canstatt s handbuch der medicinischen klinik 1841 91 13 93 91 14 93 91 15 93 william griesinger 1868 and krafft ebing 1886 also notably employed the term in distinct ways the use of the term in a criminological context was popularised by a high profile legal case in russia between 1883 and 1885 concerning the murder of a girl who had previously lived in britain for some time sarah becker sarra bekker the owner of the pawnbroker shop in which she worked and where her body was found a retired military man mr mironovich was eventually convicted on circumstantial evidence and imprisoned in the meantime however a ms semenova had handed herself in saying she had killed becker while trying to steal jewellery with her lover bezak a married policeman though she soon recanted and changed her confession semenova was found not guilty following testimony from eminent russian psychiatrist prof ivan m balinsky who described her as a psychopath still then a very general term dictionaries to this day note this as the first use of the noun via british or american articles which had suggested a known murderer had been released and in some cases that psychopaths should be immediately hanged 91 16 93 91 17 93 in 1888 julius ludwig august koch first published on his concept of psychopathic inferiority psychopathische minderwertigkeiten which would become influential domestically and internationally he used it to refer to various kinds of dysfunction or strange conduct noted in patients in the absence of obvious mental illness or retardation koch was a christian and also influenced by the degeneration theory popular in europe at the time though he referred to both congenital and acquired types habitual criminality was only a small part of his concept but the german public soon used the shortened version inferiors to refer to anyone supposedly suffering from an inherent constitutional disposition toward crime 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 early 20th century edit some writers would still use psychopathy in the general sense of mental illness such as austrian psychiatrist sigmund freud in psychopathic characters on stage 91 21 93 by contrast influential german psychiatrist emil kraepelin who had previously included a section on moral insanity in his psychiatric classification scheme was by 1904 referring to specific psychopathic subtypes all involving antisocial criminal or dissocial behaviour including born criminals inborn delinquents liars and swindlers querulous persons and driven persons including vagabonds spendthrifts and dipsomaniacs 91 22 93 the influential adolf meyer psychiatrist spread the concept of constitutional psychopathy when he emigrated to the us though unlike koch he separated out cases of what was termed psychoneurosis after world war i german psychiatrists dropped the term inferiors defectives minderwertigkeiten and used psychopathic psychopathisch and its derivatives instead at that time a more neutral term covering a wide range of conditions emil kraepelin kurt schneider and karl birnbaum developed categorisation schemes under the heading psychopathic personality only some subtypes of which were thought to have particular links to antisocial behaviour schneider in particular advanced the term and tried to formulate it in less judgemental terms than kraepelin though infamously defining it as those abnormal personalities who suffer from their abnormality or from whose abnormality society suffers 91 19 93 91 23 93 in a similar vein birnbaum a biological psychiatrist suggested from 1909 a concept similar to sociopathy implying the social environment could determine whether dispositions became criminal or not 91 24 93 from 1917 a forerunner to later diagnostic manuals called the statistical manual for the use of institutions for the insane included a category of psychoses with constitutional psychopathic inferiority this covered abnormalities in the emotional and volitional spheres associated with episodic disturbances which did not fit into the established categories of psychosis the type of behavior disorder the social reactions the trends of interests etc which the psychopathic inferior may show give special features to many cases e g criminal traits moral deficiency tramp life sexual perversions and various temperamental peculiarities constitutional psychopathic inferiority without psychosis was listed separately as one term to apply to patients considered not insane 91 25 93 meanwhile the american prison association had its own definition in which psychopathic personalities were considered non psychotic and characterized by failure to adjust to environment lacking purpose ambition and proper feelings while often showing tendencies towards delinquency lying and various eccentricities perversions or manias including dromomania compulsion to travel or experience new lifestyles kleptomania stealing pyromania fire setting etc in the uk the mental deficiency act 1913 included the category of moral imbeciles who were not intellectually idiots but displayed from an early age an alleged mental defect coupled with alleged vicious or criminal propensities and on whom punishment has little or no deterrent effect cyril burt and others pointed out that psychopathic personality was used in a broader and somewhat different way in america than in the uk 91 26 93 in the first decades of the 20th century constitutional psychopathic inferiority had become a commonly used term in the us implying the issue was inherent to the genetics or makeup of the person an organic disease 91 27 93 as a category it was used to target any and all dysfunctional or antisocial behavior and in psychiatric categorization it labeled a broad range of alleged mental deviances including homosexuality 91 28 93 some courts began to develop psychopathic laboratories for the classification and treatment of offenders the term psychopathic was chosen to avoid the social stigma of lunacy or insanity while emphasizing variance from normality rather than simply a mental hygiene issue 91 29 93 nevertheless at least one such laboratory issued a report on eugenic sterilization initiatives 91 30 93 from the 1930s sexual psychopath laws a term going back to krafft ebing started to be implemented in many us states allowing for the indeterminate psychiatric commitment of sex offenders 91 31 93 from the late 1920s american psychologist george e partridge influentially narrowed the definition of psychopathy to antisocial personality and from 1930 suggested that a more apt name for it would be sociopathy he suggested that anyone and indeed groups of people acting together could be considered sociopathic at times but that sociopaths 160 or technically essential sociopaths were chronically and pervasively so in their motivation and behavior 91 26 93 in 1933 american psychiatrist harry stack sullivan first coined the term psychopathic child which is now thought to be the first formulation of autism spectrum disorder to describe interpersonal deficiency which starts from childhood 91 32 93 scottish psychiatrist david henderson published in 1939 a theory of psychopathic states which although he described different types and unusually suggested that psychopaths might not all be criminals included a violently antisocial type which ended up contributing to that being the popular meaning of the term 91 27 93 91 33 93 in the 1940s a diagnosis of autistic psychopathy was introduced later coming to wider notice and renamed asperger syndrome to avoid the stigma of the term psychopathy 91 34 93 mid 20th century edit the mask of sanity by american psychiatrist hervey m cleckley first published in 1941 and with revised editions for several decades is considered a seminal work which provided a vivid series of case studies of individuals described as psychopaths cleckley proposed 16 characteristics of psychopathy derived mainly from his work with male psychiatric patients in a locked institution the title refers to the mask of normal functioning that cleckley thought concealed the disorganization amorality and disorder of the psychopathic personality 91 35 93 this marked the start in america of the current clinical and popularist conception of psychopathy as a particular type of antisocial emotionless and criminal character 91 36 93 cleckley would produce five editions of the book over subsequent decades including a substantial revision in 1950 expanding his case studies and theories to more non prisoners and non criminals 91 37 93 in nazi germany especially during world war ii psychiatrists and others in programmes such as action t4 and action 14f13 systematically deported sterilised interned and euthanised patients and prisoners who could be classed as mentally ill feebleminded psychopathic criminally insane or just asocial 91 19 93 in the aftermath of the war therefore concepts of antisocial psychopathic personalities fell out of favour in europe to some extent 91 38 93 at the same time however in america and other countries the concept became increasingly prominent used to categorise allied soldiers as fit or unfit for duty or on return to society or conversely in the more specific sinister sense of the term as a way to explain the actions of nazis the first version of the american psychiatric association s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm in 1952 did not use the term psychopathy as a diagnosis but sociopathic personality disturbance 91 39 93 individuals to be placed in this category were said to be ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing milieu and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals there were four subtypes called reactions after adolf meyer antisocial dyssocial sexual and addiction the antisocial reaction was said to include individuals who are chronically in trouble and do not seem to change as a result of experience or punishment with no loyalties to anyone as well as being frequently callous and lacking responsibility with an ability to rationalize their behaviour the dyssocial reaction was for individuals who disregard societal rules although they are capable of strong loyalties to others or groups although the sociopathy category was very broad by today s definitions the dsm i itself pointed out that it was more specific and limited than the then current notions of constitutional psychopathic state or psychopathic personality meanwhile other subtypes of psychopathy were sometimes proposed notably by psychoanalyst benjamin karpman from the 1940s he described psychopathy due to psychological problems e g psychotic hysterical or neurotic conditions and idiopathic psychopathy where there was no obvious psychological cause concluding that the former could not be attributed to a psychopathic personality and that the latter appeared so absent of any redeeming features that it couldn t be seen as a personality issue either but must be a constitutional anethopathy amorality or antipathy 91 40 93 91 41 93 various theories of distinctions between primary and secondary psychopathy remain to this day cleckley s concept of psychopathy as expanded on in new editions of his book particularly the sense of a conscience less man beneath a mask of normality caught the public imagination around this time it also became increasingly influential in psychiatric circles it later fell out of favor for some time however such that when he died in 1984 he was better remembered for a vivid case study of a female patient published in 1956 turned into a movie the three faces of eve in 1957 which had re popularized in america another controversial diagnosis multiple personality disorder 91 42 93 a sociologist reviewing the field in 1958 wrote that without exception on every point regarding psychopathic personality psychiatrists present varying or contradictory views 91 43 93 nevertheless criminologist sociologists william and joan mccord 91 44 93 were influential in narrowing the definition of psychopathy in some quarters to mean an antisocial lack of guilt accompanied by reactive aggression 91 45 93 91 46 93 from another direction sociologist lee robins was also an influential figure in sociopathy research stemming largely from her research based 1966 book deviant children grown up a sociological and psychiatric study of sociopathic personality based on operational criteria provided by eli robins which would shape the later diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder 91 47 93 in the mental health act in england a new category of psychopathic personality was added in 1959 renamed psychopathic disorder in 1983 then in 2007 removed entirely this was a legal subcategory in addition to mental illness which did not equate to any one psychiatric diagnosis but covered anyone with a persistent disorder or disability of mind which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct 91 48 93 on the other hand various analysts began to identify successful psychopaths in society some even suggesting it was but an adaption to the social or economic mores of the age others noting they could be hard to spot either because they were so good at hiding their lack of conscience or because many people showed the traits to some degree 91 49 93 late 20th century edit in 1968 the second edition of the dsm in place of the antisocial subtype of sociopathic personality disturbance listed antisocial personality as one of ten personality disorders this was still described in similar terms as the dsm i s category for individuals who are basically unsocialized in repeated conflicts with society incapable of significant loyalty selfish irresponsible unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences and tend to blame others and rationalise it warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis and that a group delinquent reaction of childhood or adolescence or social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder should be ruled out first the dyssocial type from the dsm i was relegated though would resurface as the main diagnosis in the icd manual of the world health organization in 1974 and republished in 1984 clinical psychologist bobby e wright wrote about the psychopathic racial personality in which he suggested that negative aspects of the overall behavior of white peoples towards non white peoples could be understood by seeing the former as displaying psychopathic traits 160 involving predatory behavior and senseless destruction combined with ability to persuade 91 50 93 91 51 93 91 52 93 there remained no international clinical agreement on the diagnosis of psychopathy a 1977 study found little relationship with the characteristics commonly attributed to psychopaths and concluded that the concept was being used too widely and loosely 91 53 93 robert d hare had published a book in 1970 summarizing research on psychopathy and was subsequently at the forefront of psychopathy research frustrated by a lack of agreed definitions or rating systems for psychopathy including at a ten day international north atlantic treaty organization nato conference in 1975 hare began developing a psychopathy checklist produced for initial circulation in 1980 it was based largely on the list of traits advanced by cleckley and partly on the theories of other authors and on his own experiences with clients in prisons meanwhile a dsm iii task force instead developed the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder based on 1972 feighner criteria for research and published in the dsm in 1980 91 54 93 this was based on some of the criteria put forward by cleckley but operationalized in behavioral rather than personality terms more specifically related to conduct apa was most concerned to demonstrate inter rater reliability rather than necessarily validity nevertheless one author referred to the concept of psychopathy in 1987 as an infinitely elastic catch all category 91 55 93 in 1988 psychologist blackburn wrote in the british journal of psychiatry that as commonly used in psychiatry it is little more than a moral judgment masquerading as a clinical diagnosis and should be scrapped 91 56 93 ellard argued similarly in the same year in the australian and new zealand journal of psychiatry describing the concept as a reflection of the customs and prejudices of a particular social group most psychiatrists are from that group and therefore fail to see the incongruity 91 57 93 by the 1970s and 80s the sexual psychopath laws were falling out of favor in many states the group for the advancement of psychiatry called them a failure based on a confusing label mixing law and psychiatry 91 58 93 hare redrafted his checklist in 1985 cleckley had died in 1984 renaming it the hare psychopathy checklist revised and finalising it as a first edition in 1991 updated with extra data in a 2nd edition in 2003 hare s list differed from cleckley s not just in rewordings and introducing quantitative scores for each point cleckley had required an absence of delusions and an absence of nervousness which was central to how he defined psychopathy whereas neither were mentioned in hare s list hare also left out mention of suicidality being rarely completed and behavior with alcohol moreover while cleckley only listed inadequately motivated antisocial behavior hare turned this into an array of specific antisocial behaviors covering a person s whole life including juvenile delinquency parasitic lifestyle poor behavioural controls and criminal versatility 91 59 93 blackburn has noted that overall hare s checklist is closer to the criminological concept of the mccords than that of cleckley 91 60 93 hare himself while noting his promotion of cleckley s work for four decades would subsequently distance himself from it to some extent 91 61 93 meanwhile following some criticism over the lack of psychological criteria in the dsm further studies were conducted leading up the dsm iv in 1994 and some personality criteria were included as associated features which were outlined in the text 91 62 93 the world health organization s icd incorporated a similar diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder both state that psychopathy or sociopathy may be considered synonyms of their diagnosis hare wrote two bestsellers on psychopathy without conscience in 1993 and snakes in suits when psychopaths go to work in 2006 cleckley had described psychopathic patients as carr ying disaster lightly in each hand and not deeply vicious but hare presented a more malevolent picture the mask of sanity had acquired a more sinister meaning 91 63 93 21st century edit in 2002 an academic dispute arose around claims and counterclaims of racism in the use of the concept of psychopathy british psychologist richard lynn claimed that some races were inherently more psychopathic than others while other psychologists criticized his data and interpretations 91 64 93 the federal bureau of investigation s monthly outreach and communication bulletin focused on psychopathy in june 2012 featuring articles introduced and co authored by the main contemporary proponent of the construct robert d hare 91 65 93 the dsm 5 published in 2013 had criteria for an overall diagnosis of antisocial dissocial personality disorder similar to dsm iv still noting that it has also been known as psychopathy or sociopathy in an alternative model suggested at the end of the manual there is an optional specifier for psychopathic features where there is a lack of anxiety fear accompanied by a bold and efficacious interpersonal style 91 66 93 overall trends edit one exhaustive analysis by a canadian psychologist describes the various lines of work as a psychopathy project attempting to establish psychopathy as an object of science overall this was found to have suffered from a number of serious logical confusions and deliberate mischaracterizations of its scientific merits including its early basis in degeneration theory tautological definitions and associated neuroscience findings routinely unclarified assumptions and shifting levels of explanation about the core concept and exaggerated statistical claims such as based on hare s use of factor analysis it was noted however that some of the limited research findings may prove useful in a better explanatory framework i e not necessarily under the umbrella of psychopathy 91 67 93 swedish sociologist roland paulsen has further placed the more recent resurgence in popular coverage of psychopathy in the context of the enlightenment project to use rationality and technology to deal with problems in human life and society 91 68 93 a scottish sociologist of biomedical ethics has suggested that the dsm s attempt to develop different standards for antisocial personality disorder have been limited and modified by path dependence on the concept of psychopathy sociopathy due to the latter being embedded in diverse sociotechnological networks and thereby demanded by various users 91 47 93 see also edit history of mental disorders
