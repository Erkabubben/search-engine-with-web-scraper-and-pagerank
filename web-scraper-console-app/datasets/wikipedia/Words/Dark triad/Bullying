narcissistic 91 34 93 they can also use bullying as a tool to conceal shame or anxiety or to boost self esteem by demeaning others the abuser feels empowered 91 35 93 bullies may bully out of jealousy or because they themselves are bullied 91 36 93 psychologist roy baumeister asserts that people who are prone to abusive behavior tend to have inflated but fragile egos because they think too highly of themselves they are frequently offended by the criticisms and lack of deference of other people and react to this disrespect with violence and insults 91 37 93 91 full citation needed 93 researchers have identified other risk factors such as depression 91 38 93 and personality disorders 91 39 93 as well as quickness to anger and use of force addiction to aggressive behaviors mistaking others actions as hostile concern with preserving self image and engaging in obsessive or rigid actions 91 40 93 a combination of these factors may also be causes of this behavior 91 41 93 in one study of youth a combination of antisocial traits and depression was found to be the best predictor of youth violence whereas video game violence and television violence exposure were not predictive of these behaviors 91 42 93 bullying may also result from a genetic predisposition or a brain abnormality in the bully 91 43 93 while parents can help a toddler develop emotional regulation and control to restrict aggressive behavior some children fail to develop these skills due to insecure attachment with their families ineffective discipline and environmental factors such as a stressful home life and hostile siblings 91 24 93 moreover according to some researchers bullies may be inclined toward negativity and perform poorly academically dr cook says a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically he or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others feels negatively toward himself herself comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers 91 44 93 contrarily some researchers have suggested that some bullies are psychologically strongest and have high social standing among their peers while their targets are emotionally distressed and socially marginalized 91 45 93 peer groups often promote the bully s actions and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors such as mocking excluding punching and insulting one another as a source of entertainment 91 24 93 other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies those who are not in turn bullied enjoy going to school and are least likely to take days off sick 91 46 93 research indicates that adults who bully have authoritarian personalities combined with a strong need to control or dominate 91 47 93 it has also been suggested that a prejudicial view of subordinates can be a particularly strong risk factor 91 48 93 in a recent study bullies showed lower school performance related self esteem than non involved students they also showed higher social self esteem than victims of traditional bullying 91 49 93 brain studies have shown that the section of the brain associated with reward becomes active when bullies are shown a video of someone inflicting pain on another 91 50 93 bystanders often bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders in many cases it is the bully s ability to create the illusion they have the support of the majority present that instills the fear of speaking out in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group unless the bully mentality is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages it often becomes an accepted or supported norm within the group 91 51 93 91 52 93 unless action is taken a culture of bullying is often perpetuated within a group for months years or longer 91 53 93 bystanders who have been able to establish their own friendship group or support group have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not 91 54 93 91 55 93 in addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self efficacy there is growing research to suggest interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong 91 56 93 among adults being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression 91 57 93 victims dr cook says a typical victim is likely to be aggressive lack social skills think negative thoughts experience difficulties in solving social problems come from a negative family school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers 91 44 93 victims often have characteristics such as being physically and mentally weak as well as being easily distraught emotionally they may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly 91 58 93 low levels of self esteem has been identified as a frequent antecedent of bullying victimization victims of traditional bullying tend to have lower global social body related and emotional self esteem compared to uninvolved students 91 49 93 91 59 93 91 60 93 91 61 93 91 62 93 victims of cyberbullying on the other hand may not have lower self esteem scores than uninvolved students but might have higher body related self esteem than both victims of traditional bullying and bullies 91 49 93 it has also been shown that victims are more likely to employ self defeating or self deprecating humor intended to entertain others at the expense of themselves and their own feelings 91 63 93 the results of a meta analysis conducted by cook and published by the american psychological association in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied and also for becoming bullies are the lack of social problem solving skills 91 44 93 children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs such as being afraid to attend school complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite a lack of interest in school activities spending

questioned and interventions should be implemented 91 72 93 the danish study showed that kids who are bullied talked to their parents and teachers about it and some reported a decrease in bullying or a stop in the bullying after a teacher or parent intervened the study emphasizes the importance of implementing program collaborations in schools to have programs and anti bullying interventions in
