gain for himself the greatest share of that which deserved social praise 91 4 93 seneca proposed a cultivation of the self within a wider community a care for the self which he opposed to mere selfishness in a theme that would later be taken up by foucault 91 5 93 medieval renaissance edit selfishness was viewed in the western christian tradition as a central vice as standing at the roots of the seven deadly sins in the form of pride 91 6 93 francis bacon carried forward this tradition when he characterised wisdom for a man s self a s the wisdom of rats 91 7 93 modernity and

91 14 93 roman catholic philosopher jacques maritain opposed the latter view by way of the aristotelian argument that framing the fundamental question of politics as a choice between altruism and selfishness is a basic and harmful mistake of modern states rather cooperation ought to be the norm human beings are by nature social animals and so individual persons can only find their full good in and through pursuing the good of the community 91 15 93 psychology edit lack of empathy has been seen as one of the roots of selfishness extending as far as the cold manipulation of the psychopath 91
