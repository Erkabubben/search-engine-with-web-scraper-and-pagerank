job interviews narcissists typically perform well at job interviews they receive more favorable hiring ratings from interviewers than individuals who are not narcissists typically because they can make favorable first impressions though that may not translate to better job performance once hired 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 91 4 93 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 impact on workplace satisfaction edit main articles occupational stress absenteeism and turnover employment impact on stress absenteeism and staff turnover edit there tends to be a higher level of stress with people who work with or interact with a narcissist while there are a variety of reasons for this to be the case an important one is the relationship between narcissism and aggression aggression is believed to moderate the relationship between narcissism and counterproductive work behaviors 91 10 93 penney and spector found narcissism to be positively related to counterproductive workplace behaviors such as interpersonal aggression sabotaging the work of others finding excuses to waste other peoples time and resources and spreading rumors 91 11 93 these aggressive acts can raise the stress of other employees 91 12 93 which in turn increases absenteeism and staff turnover 91 13 93 no correlation was found between employees under the directions of a narcissist leader and absenteeism however employees under the direction of a non narcissist leader show a decline on absenteeism over time 91 14 93 workplace bullying edit main article workplace bullying in 2007 researchers catherine mattice and brian spitzberg at san diego state university usa found that narcissism revealed a positive relationship with bullying narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics such as withholding information that affects others performance ignoring others spreading gossip constantly reminding others of mistakes ordering others to do work below their competence level and excessively monitoring others work rather than direct tactics such as making threats shouting persistently criticizing or making false allegations 91 15 93 this is significant in the workplace because narcissists are likely to be more emotionally volatile and aggressive than other employees which could become a risk for all employees 91 15 93 the research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully and that to some extent they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs 91 16 93 despite the fact that many narcissist will avoid work they can be eager to steal the work of others in line with other dark triad traits many narcissists will manipulate others and their environment so that they can claim responsibility for company accomplishments that they had little or nothing to do with 91 17 93 a study was done in 2017 that looked at dark traits within those who hold leadership positions and that effect on employee depression the research done supported the idea that employees mental health and stability was negatively affected by bullying some narcissistic behavior in the workplace 91 18 93 organizational design preferences edit narcissists like hierarchical organizations because they think they will rise to high ranks and reap status and power they take special interest in acquiring leadership positions and may be better at procuring them 91 19 93 narcissists are less interested in hierarchies where there is little opportunity for upward mobility 91 20 93 the prototypical narcissist is more concerned with getting praised and how they are perceived than doing what benefits all of the stakeholders 91 21 93 some narcissistic attributes may confer benefits but the negative and positive outcomes of narcissistic leadership are not yet fully understood in terms of the internal functioning of organizations narcissists can be especially damaging or ill fit to jobs that require judicious self assessment heavily rely on teams and or use 360 degree feedback 91 5 93 corporate narcissism edit see also organizational culture according to alan downs corporate narcissism occurs when a narcissist becomes the chief executive officer ceo or another leadership role within the senior management team and gathers an adequate mix of codependents around him or her to support the narcissistic behavior narcissists profess company loyalty but are only really committed to their own agendas thus organizational decisions are founded on the narcissist s own interests rather than the interests of the organization as a whole the various stakeholders or the society in which the organization operates 91 22 93 as a result a certain kind of charismatic leader can run a financially successful company on thoroughly unhealthy principles at least for a time 91 23 93 neville symington has suggested that one of the ways of differentiating a good enough organisation from one that is pathological is through its ability to exclude narcissistic characters from key posts 91 24 93 narcissistic supply edit main article narcissistic supply the narcissistic manager will have two main sources of narcissistic supply inanimate status symbols like cars gadgets or office views and animate flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates 91 25 93 teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries 91 26 93 the narcissistic manager s need to protect such supply networks will prevent objective decision making 91 27 93 such a manager will evaluate long term strategies according to their potential for gaining personal attention instead of to benefit the organization 91 28 93 productive narcissists edit crompton has distinguished what he calls productive narcissists from unproductive narcissists 91 29 93 maccoby acknowledged that productive narcissists still tend to be over sensitive to criticism over competitive isolated and grandiose but considered that what draws them out is that they have a sense of freedom to do whatever they want rather than feeling constantly constrained by circumstances and that through their charisma they are able to draw people into their vision and produce a cohort of disciples who will pursue the dream for all it s worth 91 30 93 91 31 93 studies show that narcissists tend to be more proactive in their work in an attempt to achieve a higher more prestigious status 91 32 93 others have questioned the concept considering that the dramatic collapse of wall street and the financial system in 2009 must give us pause is the collapse due to business leaders who have developed narcissistic styles even if ostensibly productive 91 33 93 certainly one may conclude that at best there can be quite a fine line between narcissists who perform badly in the workplace because of their traits and those who achieve outrageous success because of them 91 34 93 see also edit abusive power
