history of narcissism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search review of the topic for other uses see narcissism disambiguation the concept of excessive selfishness has been recognized throughout history the term narcissism is derived from the greek mythology of narcissus but was only coined at the close of the nineteenth century since then narcissism has become a household word in analytic literature given the great preoccupation with the subject the term is used more than almost any other 91 1 93 the meaning of narcissism has changed over time today narcissism refers to an interest in or concern with the self along a broad continuum from healthy to pathological including such concepts as self esteem self system and self representation and true or false self 91 2 93 contents 1 before freud 2 sigmund freud 2 1 primary narcissism 2 2 secondary narcissism 2 3 narcissism relationships and self worth 3 karen horney 4 heinz kohut 5 otto kernberg 6

rejected the desperate advances of the nymph echo as punishment he was doomed to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water unable to consummate his love narcissus lay gazing enraptured into the pool hour after hour 91 3 93 and finally pined away changing into a flower that bears his name the narcissus the story was retold in latin by ovid in his metamorphoses in which form it would have great influence on medieval and renaissance culture ovid s tale of echo and narcissus weaves in and out of most of the english examples of the ovidian narrative poem 91 4 93 and allusions to the story of narcissus play a large part in the poetics of the sonnets 91 5 93 of shakespeare here the term used was self love feed st thy light s flame with self substantial fuel 91 6 93 francis bacon used the same term it is the nature of extreme self lovers as they will set a house on fire and it were but to roast their eggs those that as cicero says of pompey are sui amantes sine rivali lovers of themselves without rivals 91 7 93 byron at the start of the nineteenth century used the same term describing how self love for ever creeps out like a snake to sting anything which happens to stumble on it 91 8 93 while baudelaire wrote of as vigorous a growth in the heart of natural man as self love as well as of those who like narcissuses of fat headedness are contemplating the crowd as though it were a river offering them their own image 91 9 93 by mid century however egotism was perhaps an equally common expression for self absorption egotists made acutely conscious of a self by the torture in which it dwells 91 10 93 though still with curious suggestions of the narcissus legend 91 11 93 in the background at the century s close the term as we now know it finally emerged with havelock ellis the english sexologist writing a short paper in 1927 on its coining in which he argued that the priority should in fact be divided between himself and paul n cke explaining that the term narcissus like had been used by him in 1898 as a description of a psychological attitude and that n cke in 1899 had introduced the term narcismus to describe a sexual perversion 91 12 93 the twentieth century has largely defined the concept in psychological terms with otto rank publishing in 1911 the first psychoanalytical paper specifically concerned with narcissism linking it to vanity and self admiration 91 13 93 sigmund freud edit main article sigmund freud sigmund freud by max halberstadt 1914 ernest jones tells us that at a meeting of the vienna psycho analytical society on 10 november 1909 freud had declared that narcissism was a necessary intermediate stage between auto erotism and object love 91 14 93 the following year in his leonardo he described publicly for the first time how the growing youngster finds his love objects on the path of narcissism since greek myths call a youth narcissus whom nothing pleased so much as his own mirror image 91 15 93 although freud only published a single paper exclusively devoted to narcissism called on narcissism an introduction 91 16 93 in 1914 narcissism was soon to take a central place in his thinking 91 17 93 primary narcissism edit freud suggested that exclusive self love might not be as abnormal as previously thought and might even be a common component in the human psyche he argued that narcissism is the libidinal complement to the egoism of the instinct of self preservation or more simply the desire and energy that drives one s instinct to survive he referred to this as primary narcissism 91 16 93 according to freud people are born without a sense of themselves as individuals or ego the ego develops during infancy and the early part of childhood only when the outside world usually in the form of parental controls and expectations intrudes upon primary narcissism teaching the individual about the nature and standards of his social environment from which he can form the ideal ego an image of the perfect self towards which the ego should aspire as it evolved the ego distanced itself from primary narcissism formed an ego ideal and proceeded to cathect objects 91 18 93 freud regarded all libidinous drives as fundamentally sexual and suggested that ego libido libido directed inwards to the self cannot always be clearly distinguished from object libido libido directed to persons or objects outside oneself an aspect frequently associated with primary narcissism appears in an earlier essay totem and taboo 91 19 93 in which freud describes his observations of children and primitive people what he observed was called magical thinking such as the belief that a person can impact reality by wishing or willpower it demonstrates a belief in the self as powerful and able to change external realities which freud believed was part of normal human development secondary narcissism edit according to freud secondary narcissism occurs when the libido withdraws from objects outside the self above all the mother producing a relationship to social reality that includes the potential for megalomania this megalomania has no doubt come into being at the expense of object libido this leads us to look upon the narcissism which arises through the drawing on of object cathexes as a secondary one superimposed upon a primary narcissism 91 20 93 for freud while both primary and secondary narcissism emerge in normal human development problems in the transition from one to the other can lead to pathological narcissistic disorders in adulthood this state of secondary narcissism constituted object relations of the narcissistic type according to freud something he went on to explore further in mourning and melancholia considered one of freud s most profound contributions to object relations theory and constituting the overall principles of object relations and narcissism as concepts 91 21 93 narcissism relationships and self worth edit according to freud to care for someone is to convert ego libido into object libido by giving some self love to another person which leaves less ego libido available for primary narcissism and protecting and nurturing the self when that affection is returned so is the libido thus restoring primary narcissism and self worth any failure to achieve or disruption of this balance causes psychological disturbances in such a case primary narcissism can be restored only by withdrawing object libido also called object love to replenish ego libido according to freud as a child grows and his ego develops he is constantly giving of his self love to people and objects the first of which is usually his mother this diminished self love should be replenished by the affection and caring returned to him karen horney edit main article karen horney karen horneykaren horney saw narcissism quite differently from freud kohut and other mainstream psychoanalytic theorists in that she did not posit a primary narcissism but saw the narcissistic personality as the product of a certain kind of early environment acting on a certain kind of temperament for her narcissistic needs and tendencies are not inherent in human nature narcissism is different from horney s other major defensive strategies or solutions in that it is not compensatory self idealization is compensatory in her theory but it differs from narcissism all the defensive strategies involve self idealization but in the narcissistic solution it tends to be the product of indulgence rather than of deprivation the narcissist s self esteem is not strong however because it is not based on genuine accomplishments 91 22 93 heinz kohut edit main article heinz kohut heinz kohut explored further the implications of freud s perception of narcissism he maintained that a child will tend to fantasize about having a grandiose self and ideal parents he claimed that deep down all people retain a belief in their own perfection and the perfection of anything they are part of as a person matures grandiosity gives way to self esteem and the idealization of the parent becomes the framework for core values it is when psychological trauma disrupts this process that the most primitive and narcissistic version of the self remains unchanged kohut called such conditions narcissistic personality disorder in which the merging with and detaching from an archaic self object play the central role narcissistic union with the idealized self object 91 23 93 kohut suggested narcissism as part of a stage in normal development in which caregivers provide a strong and protective presence with which the child can identify that reinforces the child s growing sense of self by mirroring his good qualities if the caregivers fail to provide adequately for their child the child grows up with a brittle and flawed sense of self 91 24 93 kohut s innovative pronouncement became a veritable manifesto in the united states the age of normal narcissism had arrived 91 25 93 kohut also saw beyond the negative and pathological aspects of narcissism believing it is a component in the development of resilience ideals and ambition once it has been transformed by life experiences or analysis 91 26 93 though critics objected that his theory of how we become attached to ideals and values instead of to our own archaic selves fits the individual who escapes from bad inner negativity into idealized objects outside 91 27 93 otto kernberg edit main article otto kernberg otto f kernberg otto kernberg uses the term narcissism to refer to the role of self in the regulation of self esteem he believed normal infantile narcissism depends on the affirmation of others and the acquisition of desirable and appealing objects which should later develop into healthy mature self esteem this healthy narcissism depends upon an integrated sense of self that incorporates images of the internalized affirmation of those close to the person and is regulated by the super ego and ego ideal internal mental structures that assure the person of his worth and that he deserves his own respect the failure of infantile narcissism to develop in this healthy adult form becomes a pathology 91 28 93 object relations theory edit main article object relations theory melanie klein s descriptions of infantile omnipotence and megalomania provided important insights for the clinical understanding of narcissistic states in 1963 writing on the psychopathology of narcissism herbert rosenfeld was especially concerned to arrive at a better definition of object relationships and their attendant defense mechanisms in narcissism 91 29 93 d w winnicott s brilliant observations of the mother child couple also throw considerable light on primary narcissism which in the young child can be viewed as the extension of the mother s narcissism 91 29 93 french connections edit lacan building on freud s dictum that all narcissistic impulses operate from the ego and have their permanent seat in the ego 91 30 93 used his own concept of the mirror stage to explore the narcissistic ego in terms of the essential structure it derives from its reference to the specular image narcissism 91 31 93 in his battle against ego psychology b la grunberger drew attention to a double orientation of narcissism as both a need for self affirmation and a tendency to restore permanent dependency the active presence of narcissism throughout life led grunberger to suggest treating it as an autonomous factor 1971 91 29 93 under the evocative title life narcissism death narcissism 1983 andr green clarified the conflict surrounding the object of narcissism whether a fantasy object or a real object in its relationship to the ego for green it was because narcissism affords the ego a certain degree of independence that a lethal kind of narcissism must be considered for the object is destroyed at the beginning of this process while in a further analysis green evokes physical narcissism intellectual narcissism and moral narcissism 91 29 93 a set of divisions sometimes simplified into that between somatic narcissists who are obsessed with the body amp cerebral narcissists people who build up their sense of magnificence out of an innate feeling of intellectual superiority 91 32 93 modern diagnosis edit narcissistic personality disorder is a condition defined in dsm 5 made by the american psychiatric association 91 33 93 the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems 10th edition icd 10 of the world health organization who lists narcissistic personality disorder npd under the category of other specific personality disorders 91 34 93 the icd 11 due to be adopted on 1 january 2022 will merge all personality disorders into one which can be coded as mild moderate or severe 91 35 93 online usage edit the success of the term narcissism has led to something of an inflation of meanings some in fact exploited it as a handy term of abuse for modern culture or as a loose synonym for bloated self esteem 91 36 93 see also edit malignant narcissism narcissism of small differences narcissistic parents
