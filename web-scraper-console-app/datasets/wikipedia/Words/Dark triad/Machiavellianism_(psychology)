machiavellianism psychology from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search psychological trait medical conditionmachiavellianismmachiavellianism is one of the traits in the dark triad model along with psychopathy and narcissism specialtypersonality psychologycausesgenetic and environmental 91 1 93 91 2 93 in the field of personality psychology machiavellianism is a personality trait centered on manipulativeness callousness and indifference to morality 91 3 93 91 4 93 91 5 93 though it has nothing to do with the historical figure or his political thought 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 the trait is named after the political theorist niccol machiavelli as psychologists richard christie and florence geis used edited and truncated statements inspired by his works to study variations in human behaviors 91 9 93 91 10 93 91 11 93 their mach iv test a 20 question likert scale personality survey became the standard self assessment tool and scale of the machiavellianism construct those who score high on the scale high machs are more likely to have a high level of deceitfulness and a cynical unempathetic temperament 91 12 93 91 13 93 it is one of the dark triad traits along with the subclinical versions of narcissism and psychopathy 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 contents 1 core features 1 1 five factor model 2 origin of the construct 2 1 genetics and

construct studying manipulators christie theorized that they would possess the following characteristics 91 17 93 1 a relative lack of affect in interpersonal relationships manipulators do not empathize with their victims the more empathy one has christie says the less likely one will manipulate a person to do their bidding 2 a lack of concern for conventional morality the manipulator is not concerned with the morality of behaviors such as lying and cheating 3 a lack of psychopathology mental illness manipulators usually have an instrumentalist view of the world which shows a lack of psychosis or other mental impairments 4 low ideological commitment five factor model edit under the recently devised five factor model of machiavellianism three characteristics underlie the construct 91 18 93 antagonism manipulativeness cynicism selfishness callousness and arrogance planfulness deliberation and orderliness agency achievement striving assertiveness self confidence emotional invulnerability activity and competence origin of the construct edit in the 1960s richard christie and florence l geis wanted to study the thought processes and actions of those who manipulated others and developed a test using a selection of statements including a few truncated and edited sentences from machiavelli s works as test items naming the construct machiavellianism after him 91 19 93 91 4 93 they wanted to assess whether or not those who were in agreement with the statements would behave differently than others who disagreed specifically in regards to manipulative actions their mach iv test a 20 question likert scale personality survey became the standard self assessment tool of the machiavellianism construct 91 9 93 using their scale christie and geis conducted multiple experimental tests that showed that the interpersonal strategies and behavior of high machs and low machs differ 91 20 93 people scoring high on the scale high machs tend to endorse manipulative statements and behave accordingly contrary to those who score lowly low machs 91 21 93 their basic results have been widely replicated 91 22 93 measured on the mach iv scale males score on average slightly higher on machiavellianism than females 91 20 93 91 23 93 the mach iv test influenced the creation of assessment scaled like the dirty dozen which contains 12 items and the short dark triad composed of 27 items 91 24 93 more recently in response to criticisms of mach iv researchers developed the five factor machiavellianism inventory ffmi which attempts to include concepts like being calculated and planful that are not adequately captured by mach iv 91 18 93 genetics and environment edit several behavioral genetics studies on the dark triad have shown that machiavellianism has both significantly genetic and environmental influences 91 25 93 91 26 93 91 27 93 one of the studies noted that while machiavellianism is heritable to a substantial degree it can also influenced by the shared environment i e sibling groups slightly more than narcissism and psychopathy 91 28 93 other traits associated with machiavellianism are influenced by genetics as well as one study notes that the co occurrence of alexithymia and machiavellianism was most heavily influenced by genetic factors and to a lesser but significant extent by non shared environmental factors 91 29 93 machiavellianism is also heavily correlated with primary psychopathy which is itself strongly heritable 91 30 93 a study on the core of dark triad traits also emphasized that both of the residuals of machiavellianism had significant genetic components 91 2 93 research on children edit there has also been extensive research on machiavellianism in young children and adolescents via a measure dubbed the kiddie mach test 91 31 93 91 32 93 peer reports suggest that children higher in machiavellianism exhibit behaviors such as using both prosocial and coercive strategies based on how much is to be gained in a situation and they tend to manipulate indirectly 91 33 93 children who high on the machiavellianism scale tend to be more successful in manipulation do it more frequently and judged as better at manipulation than those who score lower 91 34 93 parental levels of machiavellianism seem to have a slight but not great effect on the child s own level this indicates that children develop machiavellian traits on their own as time progresses 91 35 93 machiavellianism is also correlated with childhood aggression especially concerning the control of social hierarchies 91 36 93 studies have found a clear trend upwards with respect to machiavellianism from late childhood to adolescence when levels of machiavellianism are thought to peak from adolescence throughout adulthood there is a significant and steady downward trend with regard to levels of machiavellianism until the age of 65 where an overall lifetime minimum is reached 91 37 93 peer ratings of machiavellian children are inconsistent with some researchers reporting that machiavellian children are popular 91 38 93 and some reporting that they are less well liked by peers 91 39 93 91 40 93 motivation edit a 1992 review described the motivation of those high on the machiavellianism scale as related to cold selfishness and pure instrumentality and those high on the trait were assumed to pursue their motives e g sex achievement sociality in duplicitous ways more recent research on the motivations of high machs compared to low machs found that they gave high priority to money power and competition and relatively low priority to community building self love and family commitment high machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated achievement and winning at any cost 91 41 93 91 42 93 91 43 93 the research on behaviors which high machs engage in suggest that they are willing to achieve their goals by bending and breaking rules cheating and stealing 91 44 93 people high in machiavellianism are able to easily switch between working with others to taking advantage of others to achieve their goals and they are more willing to do things others see as terrible or immoral 91 45 93 91 46 93 mental abilities edit due to their skill at interpersonal manipulation there has often been an assumption that high machs possess superior intelligence or ability to understand other people in social situations recent research provides some support for this assumption 91 47 93 however other research has established that machiavellianism is unrelated to iq 91 48 93 furthermore studies on emotional intelligence have found that high machiavellianism is usually associated with low emotional intelligence as assessed by both performance and questionnaire measures 91 49 93 both emotional empathy and emotion recognition have been shown to have negative correlations with machiavellianism 91 50 93 91 51 93 additionally research has shown that machiavellianism is unrelated to a more advanced theory of mind that is the ability to anticipate what others are thinking in social situations 91 52 93 however some studies have suggested the contrary viewpoint that high machiavellianism is associated with excellent theory of mind skills 91 53 93 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 when it comes to manipulation individuals high in machiavellianism may according to bereczkei have certain cognitive and social skills that enable them to properly adapt to the challenges of environmental circumstances 91 57 93 they also are incredibly perceptive to the presence of others and feign altruism to enhance their reputation 91 58 93 dark triad edit main article dark triad in 1998 john mchoskey william worzel and christopher szyarto proposed that narcissism machiavellianism and psychopathy are more or less interchangeable in normal samples 91 59 93 91 60 93 delroy l paulhus and mchoskey debated these perspectives at an american psychological association conference inspiring a body of research that continues to grow in the published literature delroy paulhus and kevin williams found enough differences between the traits to suggest that they were distinct despite their similarities thus the concept of a triad of offensive personality traits was conceptualized 91 61 93 there has been research on machiavellianism using various dark triad measures including the short dark triad sd3 and the dark triad dirty dozen test 91 62 93 91 63 93 psychopathy edit many psychologists consider machiavellianism to be essentially indistinguishable from psychopathy as they both share manipulative tendencies and cold callousness as their primary attributes 91 64 93 91 65 93 91 66 93 according to john mchoskey the mach iv test is merely a global measure of psychopathy in noninstitutionalized populations 91 67 93 both psychopaths and machiavellians score low on conscientiousness and agreeableness and they often are dismissive of social norms and ethics 91 68 93 many other psychologists state that while machiavellianism and psychopathy overlap heavily there is much evidence to suggest that they are distinct personality constructs 91 41 93 91 69 93 91 70 93 psychologists who stress the differences between machiavellianism and psychopathy state that psychopaths differ from individuals high in machiavellianism in that they are impulsive tend to be reckless and they lack long term planning skills 91 71 93 91 72 93 91 73 93 delroy paulhus and others have stated that this difference between the two traits is often underappreciated 91 74 93 high machs have been described as master manipulators and far better at manipulation than psychopaths and narcissists 91 75 93 91 76 93 91 77 93 91 78 93 narcissism edit individuals high in machiavellianism and narcissism both manipulate to improve their reputations and how they appear to others 91 79 93 91 80 93 individuals high in the two traits do this as a form of self aggrandizement to help their chances of success in a given situation 91 81 93 machiavellianism scores were positively associated with aspects of narcissism such as entitlement and exploitativeness and inversely associated with adaptive narcissistic tendencies like self sufficiency 91 82 93 studies have also shown that machiavellians are more realistic about their character while narcissists are less realistic about theirs 91 83 93 compared to high machs narcissists are less malevolent and show a more socially positive personality they also have higher levels of self rated happiness 91 84 93 white collar crime edit research has shown that individuals high in machiavellianism may be more willing to engage in white collar crimes 91 85 93 91 86 93 delroy paulhus has stated that machiavellianism is the main trait for con artists and not psychopathy stating that although direct research on this topic is difficult it seems clear that malevolent stockbrokers such as bernie madoff do not qualify as psychopaths they are corporate machiavellians who use deliberate strategic procedures for exploiting others a genuine psychopath even at the subclinical level lacks the self control to orchestrate the schemes of a shrewd stockbroker 91 87 93 relations with other personality traits edit big five edit mach iv scores are negatively correlated with agreeableness r 0 47 and conscientiousness r 0 34 two dimensions of the big five personality model neo pi r 91 72 93 the ffmi corrects for this by including aspects of high conscientiousness in the scale e g order deliberation 91 18 93 additionally machiavellianism correlates more highly with the honesty humility dimension of the six factor hexaco model than with any of the big five dimensions 91 41 93 machiavellianism has also been located within the interpersonal circumplex which consists of the two independent dimensions of agency and communion agency refers to the motivation to succeed and to individuate the self whereas communion refers to the motivation to merge with others and to support group interests machiavellianism lies in the quadrant of the circumplex defined by high agency and low communion 91 41 93 machiavellianism has been found to lie diagonally opposite from a circumplex construct called self construal a tendency to prefer communion over agency this suggests that people high in machiavellianism do not simply wish to achieve they wish to do so at the expense of or at least without regard to others 91 41 93 91 88 93 hot and cold empathy edit there are two distinct types of empathy which people use to relate to each other which are referred to as hot and cold empathy cold empathy refers to the understanding of how others might react to one s actions or a certain event hot empathy refers to the emotional reaction others might have to an event people high in machiavellianism tend to have a better understanding of cold empathy and do not feel hot empathy which explains why they seem cold and uncaring 91 45 93 some studies have suggested that machiavellians are deficient only at the level of affective empathy sharing of emotions whereas their cognitive empathy is intact even high 91 56 93 91 89 93 91 90 93 91 91 93 another study suggested that high machs are deficient at both kinds of empathy 91 92 93 studies also assert that high machs don t feel guilt over the consequences of their manipulations 91 93 93 alexithymia edit alexithymia is considered a key trait correlated heavily with machiavellianism 91 94 93 91 56 93 91 95 93 it is the lack of awareness of one s own emotions as well as the emotions of others 91 96 93 when tested healthy alexithymic individuals have been found to obtain high machiavellianism scores 91 97 93 91 56 93 this was not surprising to researchers seeing as one of the core traits of machiavellianism is unemotionality similar to what alexithymics experience 91 98 93 in the workplace edit main article machiavellianism in the workplace machiavellianism is also studied by organizational psychologists especially those who study manipulative behaviors in workplace settings 91 99 93 91 100 93 91 101 93 workplace behaviors associated with this concept include flattery deceit coercion and the abuse of others through one s position of leadership 91 102 93 91 103 93 91 104 93 these behaviors in the workplace are ultimately done to advance personal interests 91 105 93 91 106 93 91 80 93 research has shown that one s level of machiavellianism can be a major factor in situations where workplace manipulation is involved because this trait can have an effect on the ability for an individual to fit into a highly political work environment 91 107 93 research has found individuals with dark triad traits are drawn to entrepreneurship certain qualities found in the dark triad are similar to traits needed for effective entrepreneurship such as confidence charisma and risk taking 91 108 93 dimensions of the mach scale edit although there have been myriad proposed factor structures two dimensions emerge most consistently within factor analytic research differentiating machiavellian views from behaviors 91 109 93 although many posit that the mach iv scale is unable to reliably capture the two dimensions a 10 item subset of the scale known as the two dimensional mach iv tdm v reproduces the views and tactics dimensions across countries genders sample types and scale category length 91 110 93 91 111 93 the views dimension appears to capture the neurotic narcissistic pessimistic and distrustful aspects of machiavellianism while the tactics component captures the more unconscientious self serving and deceitful behavioral aspects game theory edit in 2002 the machiavellianism scale of christie and geis was applied by behavioral game theorists anna gunnthorsdottir kevin mccabe and vernon l smith in their search for explanations for the spread of observed behavior in experimental games in particular individual choices which do not correspond to assumptions of material self interest captured by the standard nash equilibrium prediction 91 23 93 it was found that in a trust game those with high mach iv scores tended to follow homo economicus equilibrium strategies while those with low mach iv scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium and instead made choices that reflected widely accepted moral standards and social preferences see
