reasonable self esteem or confidence and satisfaction in oneself 91 1 93 a healthy amount of pride is good however pride sometimes is used interchangeably with conceit or arrogance among other words which are negative 91 2 93 91 3 93 oxford defines it as the quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one s own importance 91 4 93 this may be related to one s own abilities or achievements positive characteristics of friends or family or one s country richard taylor defined pride as the justified love of oneself 91 5 93 as opposed to false pride or narcissism similarly st augustine defined it as the love of one s own excellence 91 6 93 and meher baba called it the specific feeling through which egoism manifests 91 7 93 philosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions e g that pride is distinct from happiness and joy through language based interaction with others 91 8 93 some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional automatically perceived signal of high social status 91 9 93 pride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a vice sometimes as proper or as a virtue with a positive connotation pride refers to a content sense of attachment toward one s own or another s choices and actions or toward a whole group of people and is a product of praise independent self reflection and a fulfilled feeling of belonging with a negative connotation pride refers to a foolishly 91 10 93 and irrationally corrupt sense of one s personal value status or accomplishments 91 11 93 used synonymously with hubris while some philosophers such as aristotle and george bernard shaw consider pride but not hubris a profound virtue some world religions consider pride s fraudulent form a sin such as is expressed in proverbs 11 2 of the hebrew bible in judaism pride is called the root of all evil when viewed as a virtue pride in one s abilities is known as virtuous pride the greatness of soul or magnanimity but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self idolatry sadistic contempt vanity or vainglory other possible objects of pride are one s ethnicity and one s sexual identity especially lgbt pride 91 citation needed 93 contents 1 etymology 2 ancient

became preux in french from late latin term prodis useful which is compared with the latin prodesse be of use 91 12 93 the sense of having a high opinion of oneself not in french may reflect the anglo saxons opinion of the norman knights who called themselves proud 91 13 93 ancient greek philosophy edit aristotle identified pride megalopsuchia variously translated as proper pride the greatness of soul and magnanimity 91 14 93 as the crown of the virtues distinguishing it from vanity temperance and humility thus now the man is thought to be proud who thinks himself worthy of great things being worthy of them for he who does so beyond his deserts is a fool but no virtuous man is foolish or silly the proud man then is the man we have described for he who is worthy of little and thinks himself worthy of little is temperate but not proud for pride implies greatness as beauty implies a goodsized body and little people may be neat and well proportioned but cannot be beautiful 91 15 93 he concludes then that pride then seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues for it makes them more powerful and it is not found without them therefore it is hard to be truly proud for it is impossible without nobility and goodness of character 91 16 93 91 17 93 by contrast aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows to cause shame to the victim not in order that anything may happen to you nor because anything has happened to you but merely for your own gratification hubris is not the requital of past injuries this is revenge as for the pleasure in hubris its cause is this naive men think that by ill treating others they make their own superiority the greater 91 18 93 thus although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing for aristotle and many philosophers hubris is altogether an entirely different thing from pride psychology edit since pride is classified as an emotion or passion it is pride both cognitive and evaluative and that its object that which it cognizes and evaluates is the self and its properties or something the proud individual identifies with 91 11 93 like guilt and shame it is specifically described in the field as a self conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of the self and one s behavior according to internal and external standards 91 19 93 this is further explained by the way pride results from satisfying or conforming to a standard while guilt or shame is an offshoot of defying it an observation cites the lack of research that addresses pride because it is despised as well as valued in the individualist west where it is experienced as pleasurable 91 20 93 emotion edit in psychological terms positive pride is a pleasant sometimes exhilarating emotion that results from a positive self evaluation 91 21 93 it was added by tracy et al to the university of california davis set of emotion expressions ucdsee in 2009 as one of three self conscious emotions known to have recognizable expressions along with embarrassment and shame 91 22 93 the term fiero was coined by italian psychologist isabella poggi to describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a personal triumph over adversity 91 23 93 91 24 93 facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin smiles or arms on hips to demonstrate victory individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so indeed some studies show that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person s high social status in a group 91 9 93 behaviorally pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body this postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others 91 25 93 positive outcomes edit a common understanding of pride is that it results from self directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals for example weiner et al have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone moreover oveis et al conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others as well as differentiation from weak others seen in this light pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy enhancing emotion as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict 91 26 93 pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment it is related to more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud weiner 1985 pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion along with hope it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events it may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended fredrickson 2001 according to bagozzi et al pride can have positive benefits of enhancing creativity productivity and altruism for instance it has been found that in terms of school achievement pride is associated with a higher gpa in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods pride is associated with a lower gpa 91 27 93 economics edit in the field of economic psychology pride is conceptualized in a spectrum ranging from proper pride associated with genuine achievements and false pride which can be maladaptive or even pathological lea et al have examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them 91 28 93 understood in this way pride is an emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial decisions that are in their long term interests even when in the short term they would appear irrational sin and self acceptance edit see also self esteem 160 contingent vs non contingent pride from the seven deadly sins by jacob matham c 1592 inordinate self esteem is called pride 91 29 93 classical christian theology views pride as being the result of high self esteem and thus high self esteem was viewed as the primary human problem but beginning in the 20th century humanistic psychology diagnosed the primary human problem as low self esteem stemming from a lack of belief in one s true worth carl rogers observed that most people regard themselves as worthless and unlovable thus they lack self esteem 91 30 93 in the king james bible people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the term haughty pride comes before a fall 1611 king james version of the bible book of proverbs 16 18 terry cooper conceptualized in 2003 excessive pride along with low self esteem as an important paradigm in describing the human condition he examines and compares the augustinian niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women the humanistic psychology position that pride does not adequately account for anyone s experience and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self 91 31 93 he considers that the work of certain neo freudian psychoanalysts namely karen horney offers promise in dealing with what he calls a deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self cooper 112 3 cooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self contempt and low self esteem the idealized self the tyranny of the should the pride system and the nature of self hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self contempt understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self contempt and low self esteem cooper 112 3 thus hubris which is an exaggerated form of self esteem is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self esteem the committer of pride feels deep down hubris and group narcissism edit main article hubrissee also group narcissism hubris itself is associated with more intra individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility tangney 1999 as one might expect hubris is not necessarily associated with high self esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self esteem excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions rhodwalt et al 91 citation needed 93 several studies by uc davis psychologist cynthia picket about group pride have shown that groups that boast gloat or denigrate others tend to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups 91 32 93 suggesting that hubristic pompous displays of group pride might be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of strength she states that those that express pride by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes research from the university of sydney have found that hubristic pride was positively correlated with arrogance and self aggrandizement and promotes prejudice and discrimination but authentic pride was associated with self confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals 91 33 93 ethnic edit the

91 37 93 though like earlier discussions on pride when pride tips into hubris people have been known to commit atrocities 91 38 93 types of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety the difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the us and china 91 39 93 in the us individual pride tends and seems to be held more often in thought the people in china seem to hold greater views for the nation as a whole 91 40 93 the value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to be a running theme and debate among cultures 91 41 93 this debate shadows the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride shouldn t be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad but about which form of it is the most useful 91 41 93 german edit the father and mother by boardman robinson depicting war as the offspring of greed and pride main article german nationalism in germany national pride nationalstolz is often associated with the former nazism strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many germans there is an ongoing public debate about the issue of german patriotism the world cup in 2006 held in germany saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows as the team progressed through the tournament so too did the level of support across the nation 91 42 93 asian edit main article asian pride asian pride in modern slang refers mostly to those of east asian descent though it can include anyone of asian descent asian pride was originally fragmented as asian nations have had long conflicts with each other examples are the old japanese and chinese religious beliefs of their superiority asian pride emerged prominently during european colonialism 91 43 93 at one time europeans controlled 85 of the world s land through colonialism resulting in anti western feelings among asian nations 91 43 93 today some asians still look upon european involvement in their affairs with suspicion 91 43 93 in contrast asian empires are prominent and are proudly remembered by adherents to asian pride there is an emerging discourse of chinese pride that unfolds complex histories and maps of privileges and empowerments in a deeper sense it is a strategic positioning aligned with approaches such as asia as method 91 44 93 to invite more diverse resistances in language culture and practices in challenging colonial imperial dominations and being critical of eurocentric epistemologies 91 45 93 in more specific cases it examines the sinophone circulations of power relations connecting the transnational to the local for example a particular set of chinese canadian relations between china s increasing industrial materiality and output in which pride becomes an expansionist reach and mobilization of capital canada s active interests in tapping into asian and chinese labours markets and industrial productions and the intersected cultural politics of chinese ness in an east pacific british columbia city where chinese has been tagged as a majority minority 91 45 93 black edit main article black pride black pride is a slogan used primarily in the united states to raise awareness for a black racial identity the slogan has been used by african

and gender identity that sexual diversity is a gift and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent and cannot be intentionally altered 91 52 93 the word pride is used in this case as an antonym for shame it is an affirmation of self and community the modern gay pride movement began after the stonewall riots of the late 1960s in june 1970 the first pride parade in the united states commemorated the one year anniversary of the stonewall riots the nearly week long uprising between new york city youth and police officers following a raid of stonewall inn 91 53 93 vanity edit main article vanity detail of pride in the seven deadly sins and the four last things by hieronymus bosch in conventional parlance vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one s appearance attractiveness and dress and is thus not the same as pride however it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one s abilities or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may in so far be compared to pride the term vanity originates from the latin word vanitas meaning emptiness untruthfulness futility foolishness and empty pride 91 54 93 here empty pride means a fake pride in the sense of vainglory unjustified by one s own achievements and actions but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics the fallen angel 1847 by alexandre cabanel depicting lucifer jacques callot pride vanity probably after 1621 in many religions vanity is considered a form of self idolatry in which one rejects god for the sake of one s own image and thereby becomes divorced from the graces of god the stories of lucifer and narcissus who gave us the term narcissism and others attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity in western art vanity was often symbolized by a peacock and in biblical terms by the whore of babylon during the renaissance vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman sometimes seated or reclining on a couch she attends to her hair with a comb and mirror the mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto other symbols of vanity include jewels gold coins a purse and often by the figure of death himself all is vanity by c allan gilbert evoking the inevitable decay of life and beauty toward deathoften we find an inscription on a scroll that reads omnia vanitas all is vanity a quote from the latin translation of the book of ecclesiastes 91 55 93 although that phrase itself depicted in a type of still life vanitas originally referred not to an obsession with one s appearance but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man s efforts in this world the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture the artist invites us to pay lip service to condemning her writes edwin mullins while offering us full permission to drool over her she admires herself in the glass while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass a window through which we peer and secretly desire her 91 56 93 the theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non allegorical one of a reclining venus in his table of the seven deadly sins hieronymus bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil behind her is an open jewelry box a painting attributed to nicolas tournier which hangs in the ashmolean museum is an allegory of justice and vanity a young woman holds a balance symbolizing justice she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her vermeer s famous painting girl with a pearl earring is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes 91 57 93 all is vanity by charles allan gilbert 1873 1929 carries on this theme an optical illusion the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull upon closer examination it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death see also edit philosophy
