91 1 93 and introversion are a central dimension in some human personality theories the terms introversion and extraversion were introduced into psychology by carl jung 91 2 93 although both the popular understanding and current psychological usage vary extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing talkative energetic behavior whereas introversion is manifested in more reflective and reserved behavior 91 3 93 jung defined introversion as an attitude type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents and extraversion as an attitude type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object 91 4 93 extraversion and introversion are typically viewed as a single continuum so to be higher in one necessitates being lower in the other jung provides a different perspective and suggests that everyone has both an extraverted side and an introverted side with one being more dominant than the other virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms examples include the big five model jung s analytical psychology hans eysenck s three factor model raymond cattell s 16 personality factors the

and reached this conclusion the introverts are those in whom reflective thought inhibits and postpones action and expression the extroverts are those in whom the energies liberated upon the stirring of any propensity flow out freely in outward action and expression 91 5 93 extraversion edit extraversion is the state of primarily obtaining gratification from outside oneself 91 6 93 extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic talkative assertive and gregarious extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people they take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings such as parties community activities public demonstrations and business or political groups they also tend to work well in groups 91 7 93 an extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone they tend to be energized when around other people and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves introversion edit introversion is a personality trait distinct from shyness and social anxiety disorder 91 8 93 introversion is the state of being predominantly interested in one s own mental self 91 6 93 introverts are typically perceived as more reserved or reflective 91 7 93 some popular psychologists have characterized introverts as people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction this is similar to jung s view although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy few modern conceptions make this distinction introverts often take pleasure in solitary activities such as reading writing or meditating an introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet more minimally stimulating external environment 91 9 93 they prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate especially observed in developing children and adolescents 91 10 93 they are more analytical before speaking 91 11 93 quiet the power of introverts author susan cain defines introversion and extraversion in terms of preferences for different levels of stimulation distinguishing it from shyness fear of social judgment and humiliation 91 12 93 mistaking introversion for shyness is a common error introversion is a preference while shyness stems from distress introverts prefer solitary to social activities but do not necessarily fear social encounters like shy people do 91 13 93 susan cain author of the book quiet the power of introverts in a world that can t stop talking argues that modern western culture misjudges the capabilities of introverted people leading to a waste of talent energy and happiness 91 14 93 cain describes how society is biased against introverts and that with people being taught from childhood that to be sociable is to be happy introversion is now considered somewhere between a disappointment and pathology 91 15 93 in contrast cain says that introversion is not a second class trait but that both introverts and extraverts enrich society with examples including the introverts j k rowling 91 16 93 isaac newton albert einstein mahatma gandhi dr seuss w b yeats steven spielberg and larry page 91 15 93 ambiversion edit most contemporary trait theories measure levels of extraversion introversion as part of a single continuous dimension of personality with some scores near one end and others near the halfway mark 91 17 93 ambiversion is falling more or less in the middle 91 6 93 91 18 93 relative prevalence edit cain further reports that studies indicate that 33 to 50 of the american population are introverts 91 19 93 particular demographics have higher prevalence with a 6 000 subject mbti based survey indicating that 60 of attorneys and 90 of intellectual property attorneys are introverts 91 20 93 measurement edit the extent of extraversion and introversion is most commonly assessed through self report measures although peer reports and third party observation can also be used self report measures are either lexical 91 3 93 or based on statements 91 21 93 the type of measure is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken lexical self reporting edit lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect extravert and introvert traits such as outgoing talkative reserved and quiet words representing introversion are reverse coded to create composite measures of extraversion introversion running on a continuum goldberg 1992 91 22 93 developed a 20 word measure as part of his 100 word big five markers saucier 1994 91 23 93 developed a briefer 8 word measure as part of his 40 word mini markers however the psychometric properties of saucier s original mini markers have been found to be suboptimal with samples outside of north america 91 3 93 as a result a systematically revised measure was developed to have better psychometric properties the international english mini markers 91 3 93 the international english mini markers has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing extraversion introversion and other five factor personality dimensions both within and especially without american populations internal consistency reliability of the extraversion measure for native english speakers is reported as a cronbach s alpha of 0 92 that for non native english speakers is of 0 85 statement self reporting edit statement measures tend to contain more words and hence consume more research instrument space than lexical measures respondents are asked the extent to which they for example talk to a lot of different people at parties or often feel uncomfortable around others 91 21 93 while some statement based measures of extraversion introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in north american populations to lexical measures their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations 91 24 93 for example statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties as americans are assumed to do moreover the sometimes colloquial north american language of statements makes them less suited for use outside america for instance statements like keep in the background and know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non native english speakers to understand except in a literal sense eysenck s theory edit hans eysenck described extraversion introversion as the degree to which a person is outgoing and interactive with other people these behavioral differences are presumed to be the result of underlying differences in brain physiology 91 25 93 eysenck associated cortical inhibition and excitation with the ascending reticular activation system aras a pathway located in the brainstem 91 26 93 extraverts seek excitement and social activity in an effort to raise their naturally low arousal level whereas introverts tend to avoid social situations in an effort to avoid raising their naturally high arousal level too far eysenck designated extraversion as one of three major traits in his p e n model of personality which also includes psychoticism and neuroticism eysenck originally suggested that extraversion was a combination of two major tendencies impulsiveness and sociability he later added several other more specific traits namely liveliness activity level and excitability these traits are further linked in his personality hierarchy to even more specific habitual responses such as partying on the weekend eysenck compared this trait to the four temperaments of ancient medicine with choleric and sanguine temperaments equating to extraversion and melancholic and phlegmatic temperaments equating to introversion 91 27 93 twin studies indicate that extraversion introversion has a genetic component biological factors edit the relative importance of nature versus environment in determining the level of extraversion is controversial and the focus of many studies twin studies have found a genetic component of 39 to 58 in terms of the environmental component the shared family environment appears to be far less important than individual environmental factors that are not shared between siblings 91 28 93 eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused by variability in cortical arousal he hypothesized that introverts are characterized by higher levels of activity than extraverts and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts that extraverts require more external stimulation than introverts has been interpreted as evidence for this hypothesis other evidence of the stimulation hypothesis is that introverts salivate more than extraverts in response to a drop of lemon juice this is due to increased activity in their aras which responds to stimuli like food or social contact 91 29 93 91 30 93 extraversion has been linked to higher sensitivity of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli 91 31 93 this in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward one consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement since the reward itself is experienced as greater one study found that introverts have more blood flow in the frontal lobes of their brain and the anterior or frontal thalamus which are areas dealing with internal processing such as planning and problem solving extraverts have more blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus temporal lobes and posterior thalamus which are involved in sensory and emotional experience 91 32 93 this study and other research indicate that introversion extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function a study on regional brain volume found a positive correlation between introversion and grey matter volume in the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction as well as a positive correlation between introversion and total white matter volume 91 33 93 task related functional neuroimaging has shown that extraversion is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus prefrontal cortex middle temporal gyrus and the amygdala 91 34 93 extraversion has also been linked to physiological factors such as respiration through its association with surgency 91 35 93 behaviour edit various differences in behavioural characteristics are attributed to extraverts and introverts according to one study extraverts tend to wear more decorative clothing whereas introverts prefer practical comfortable clothes 91 36 93 extraverts are more likely to prefer more upbeat conventional and energetic music than introverts 91 37 93 personality also influences how people arrange their work areas in general extraverts decorate their offices more keep their doors open keep extra chairs nearby and are more likely to put dishes of candy on their desks these are attempts to invite co workers and encourage interaction introverts in contrast decorate less and tend to arrange their workspace to discourage social interaction 91 38 93 despite these differences a meta analysis of 15 experience sampling studies has suggested that there is a great deal of overlap in the way that extraverts and introverts behave 91 39 93 in these studies participants used mobile devices to report how extraverted e g bold talkative assertive outgoing they were acting at multiple times during their daily lives fleeson and gallagher 2009 found that extraverts regularly behave in an introverted way and introverts regularly behave in an extraverted way indeed there was more within person variability than between person variability in extraverted behaviours the key feature that distinguishes extraverts and introverts was that extraverts tend to act moderately extraverted about 5 10 more often than introverts from this perspective extraverts and introverts are not fundamentally different rather an extravert is just someone who acts more extraverted more often suggesting that extraversion is more about what one does than what one has additionally a study by lippa 1978 found evidence for the extent to which individuals present themselves in a different way this is called expressive behaviour and it is dependent upon the individuals motivation and ability to control that behaviour lippa 1978 examined 68 students who were asked to role play by pretending to teach a math class the students level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external expressive behaviours such as stride length graphic expansiveness the percentage of time they spent talking the amount of time they spent making eye contact and the total time of each teaching session this study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self monitoring 91 40 93 this means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted and rather socially desirable version of themselves thus individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations humans are complex and unique and because introversion extraversion varies along a continuum individuals may have a mixture of both orientations a person who acts introverted in one situation may act extraverted in another and people can learn to act in counter dispositional ways in certain situations for example brian little s free trait theory 91 41 93 91 42 93 suggests that people can take on free traits behaving in ways that may not be their first nature but can strategically advance projects that are important to them together this presents an optimistic view of what extraversion is rather than being fixed and stable individuals vary in their extraverted behaviours across different moments and can choose to act extraverted to advance important personal projects or even increase their happiness as mentioned above implications edit acknowledging that introversion and extraversion are normal variants of behavior can help in self acceptance and understanding of others for example an extravert can accept their introverted partner s need for solitude while an introvert can acknowledge their extraverted partner s need for social interaction researchers have found a correlation between extraversion and self reported happiness that is more extraverted people tend to report higher levels of happiness than introverts 91 43 93 91 44 93 other research has shown that being instructed to act in an extraverted manner leads to increases in positive affect even for people who are trait level introverts 91 45 93 this does not mean that introverts are unhappy extraverts simply report experiencing more positive emotions whereas introverts tend to be closer to neutral this may be because extraversion is socially preferable in contemporary western culture and thus introversion feels less desirable in addition to the research on happiness other studies have found that extraverts tend to report higher levels of self esteem than introverts 91 46 93 91 47 93 others suggest that such results reflect socio cultural bias in the survey itself 91 11 93 dr david meyers has claimed that happiness is a matter of possessing three traits self esteem optimism and extraversion meyers bases his conclusions on studies that report extraverts to be happier these findings have been questioned in light of the fact that the happiness prompts given to the studies subjects such as i like to be with others and i m fun to be with only measure happiness among extraverts 91 11 93 also according to carl jung introverts acknowledge more readily their psychological needs and problems whereas extraverts tend to be oblivious to them because they focus more on the outer world 91 2 93 although extraversion is perceived as socially desirable in western culture it is not always an advantage for example extraverted youths are more likely to engage in antisocial or delinquent behavior 91 48 93 91 49 93 in line with this certain evidence suggest that the trait of extraversion may also be related to that of psychopathy 91 50 93 91 51 93 conversely while introversion is perceived as less socially desirable it is strongly associated with positive traits such as intelligence 91 52 93 and giftedness 91 53 93 91 54 93 for many years researchers have found that introverts tend to be more successful in academic environments which extraverts may find boring 91 55 93 research shows that behavioral immune system the psychological processes that infer infection risk from perceptual cues and respond to these perceptual cues through the activation of aversive emotions may influence gregariousness although extraversion is associated with many positive outcomes like higher levels of happiness those extraverted people are also more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases such as airborne infections as they tend to have more contact with people when individuals are more vulnerable to infection the cost of being social will be relatively greater therefore people tend to be less extraversive when they feel vulnerable and vice versa 91 56 93 although neither introversion nor extraversion is pathological psychotherapists can take temperament into account when treating clients clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion extraversion spectrum teachers can also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils for example acknowledging that introverted children need more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study 91 citation needed 93 regional variation edit some claim that americans live in an extraverted society 91 57 93 that rewards extravert behavior and rejects introversion 91 58 93 this is because the u s is a culture of external personality whereas in some other cultures people are valued for their inner selves and their moral rectitude 91 59 93 other cultures such as those in japan china and regions where orthodox christianity buddhism sufism etc prevail prize introversion 91 11 93 these cultural differences predict individuals happiness in that people who score higher in extraversion are happier on average in particularly extraverted cultures and vice versa 91 60 93 researchers have found that people who live on islands tend to be less extraverted more introverted than those living on the mainland and that people whose ancestors had inhabited the island for twenty generations tend to be less extraverted than more recent arrivals furthermore people who emigrate from islands to the mainland tend to be more extraverted than people that stay on islands and those that immigrate to islands 91 60 93 in the united states researchers have found that people living in the midwestern states of north dakota south dakota nebraska minnesota wisconsin and illinois score higher than the u s average on extraversion utah and the southeastern states of florida and georgia also score high on this personality trait the most introverted states in the u s are maryland new hampshire alaska washington oregon and vermont people who live in the northwestern states of idaho montana and wyoming are also relatively introverted 91 61 93 relation to happiness edit as earlier stated extraverts are often found to have higher levels of positive affect than introverts 91 44 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 however this relationship has only been found between extraversion and activated forms of positive affect 91 64 93 91 65 93 there is no relationship between extraversion and deactivated calm forms of positive affect such as contentment or serenity although one study found a negative relationship between extraversion and deactivated positive affect i e a positive relationship between introversion and calm positive affect 91 64 93 moreover the relationship between extraversion and activated positive affect is only significant for agentic extraversion i e there is no significant relationship between affiliative extraversion and activated positive affect especially when controlling for neuroticism 91 64 93 91 66 93 an influential review article concluded that personality specifically extraversion and emotional stability was the best predictor of subjective well being 91 67 93 as examples argyle and lu 1990 91 68 93 found that the trait of extraversion as measured by extraversion scale of the eysenck personality questionnaire epq was positively and significantly correlated with positive affect as measured by the oxford happiness inventory using the same positive affect and extraversion scales hills and argyle 2001 91 69 93 found that positive affect was again significantly correlated with extraversion also the study by emmons and diener 1986 91 70 93 showed that extraversion correlates positively and significantly with positive affect but not with negative affect similar results were found in a large longitudinal study by diener sandvik pavot and fujita 1992 91 71 93 which assessed 14 407 participants from 100 areas of continental united states using the abbreviated general well being schedule which tapped positive and negative affects and costa and mccrae s 1986 91 72 93 short version of the neo s extraversion scale the authors reported that extraverts experienced greater well being at two points in time during which data were collected first between 1971 and 1975 and later between 1981 and 1984 however the latter study did not control for neuroticism an important covariate when investigating relationships between extraversion and positive affect or wellbeing 91 73 93 studies that controlled for neuroticism have found no significant relationship between extraversion and subjective well being 91 73 93 larsen and ketelaar 1991 91 74 93 showed that extraverts respond more to positive affect than to negative affect since they exhibit more positive affect reactivity to the positive affect induction yet they do not react more negatively to the negative affect induction 91 75 93 instrumental view edit the instrumental view proposes that personality traits give rise to conditions and actions which have affective consequences and thus generate individual differences in emotionality 91 75 93 91 76 93 personality trait as a cause of higher sociability edit according to the instrumental view one explanation for greater subjective well being among extraverts could be that extraversion helps in the creation of life circumstances which promote high levels of positive affect specifically the personality trait of extraversion is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions 91 62 93 91 75 93 91 77 93 since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal 91 78 93 social activity hypothesis edit according to the social activity hypothesis more frequent participation in social situations creates more frequent and higher levels of positive affect therefore it is believed that since extraverts are characterized as more sociable than introverts they also possess higher levels of positive affect brought on by social interactions 91 79 93 91 80 93 91 81 93 specifically the results of furnham and brewin s study 1990 91 63 93 suggest that extraverts enjoy and participate more in social activities than introverts and as a result extraverts report a higher level of happiness also in the study of argyle and lu 1990 91 68 93 extraverts were found to be less likely to avoid participation in noisy social activities and to be more likely to participate in social activities such as party games jokes or going to the cinema similar results were reported by diener larsen and emmons 1984 91 82 93 who found that extraverts seek social situations more often than introverts especially when engaging in recreational activities however a variety of findings contradict the claims of the social activity hypothesis firstly it was found that extraverts were happier than introverts even when alone specifically extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others or whether they live in a vibrant city or quiet rural environment 91 44 93 similarly a study by diener sandvik pavot and fujita 1992 91 71 93 showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently 51 than nonsocial jobs compared to introverts 38 they were happier than introverts regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character secondly it was found that extraverts only sometimes reported greater amounts of social activity than introverts 91 82 93 but in general extraverts and introverts do not differ in the quantity of their socialization 91 44 93 similar finding was reported by srivastava angelo and vallereux 2008 91 83 93 who found that extraverts and introverts both enjoy participating in social interactions but extraverts participate socially more thirdly studies have shown that both extraverts and introverts participate in social relations but that the quality of this participation differs the more frequent social participation among extraverts could be explained by the fact that extraverts know more people but those people are not necessarily their close friends whereas introverts when participating in social interactions are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships 91 69 93 social attention theory edit yet another explanation of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by ashton lee and paunonen 2002 91 84 93 they suggested that the core element of extraversion is a tendency to behave in ways that attract hold and enjoy social attention and not reward sensitivity they claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding therefore if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm energy and excitement that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others attention this favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior 91 84 93 ashton lee and paunonen s 2002 91 84 93 study showed that their measure of social attention the social attention scale was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity temperamental view edit temperamental view is based on the notion that there is a direct link between people s personality traits and their sensitivity to positive and negative affects 91 62 93 91 74 93 91 75 93 affective reactivity model edit the affective reactivity model states that the strength of a person s reactions to affect relevant events are caused by people s differences in affect 91 74 93 91 85 93 this model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by jeffrey alan gray which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system bas are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system bis are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and introversion 91 86 93 therefore extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects 91 31 93 91 74 93 91 85 93 91 87 93 91 88 93 for example gable reis and elliot 2000 91 89 93 found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive bis reported higher levels of average negative affect while people with more sensitive bas reported higher levels of positive affect also zelenski and larsen 1999 91 75 93 found that people with more sensitive bas reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction while people with more sensitive bis reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction 91 citation needed 93 social reactivity theory edit the social reactivity theory alleges that all humans whether they like it or not are required to participate in social situations since extraverts prefer engaging in social interactions more than introverts they also derive more positive affect from such situations than introverts do 91 44 93 91 68 93 91 82 93 the support for this theory comes from work of brian r little who popularized concept of restorative niches little claimed that life often requires people to participate in social situations and since acting social is out of character for introverts it was shown to harm their well being therefore one way to preserve introverts well being is for them to recharge as often as possible in places where they can return to their true selves places little calls restorative niches 91 90 93 however it was also found that extraverts did not respond stronger to social situations than introverts nor did they report bigger boosts of positive affect during such interactions 91 77 93 91 83 93 affective regulation edit another possible explanation for more happiness among extraverts comes from the fact that extraverts are able to better regulate their affective states this means that in ambiguous situations situations where positive and negative moods are introduced and mixed in similar proportions extraverts show a slower decrease of positive affect and as a result they maintained a more positive affect balance than introverts 91 91 93 extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness e g recalling pleasant vs unpleasant memories more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks 91 92 93 the set point model aka affect level model edit according to the set point model levels of positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual hence after a positive or negative event people s moods tend to go back to the pre set level according to the set point model extraverts experience more happiness because their pre set level of positive affect is set higher than the pre set point of positive affect in introverts therefore extraverts require less positive reinforcement in order to feel happy 91 88 93 pleasure arousal relation edit a study by peter kuppens 2008 91 93 93 showed that extraverts and introverts engage in different behaviors when feeling pleasant which may explain underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts specifically kuppens 2008 91 93 93 found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts which means that pleasant feelings are more likely to be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts on the other hand arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant in other words if everything is going well in an extravert s life which is a source of pleasant feelings extraverts see such a situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit which brings about an active aroused pleasant state when everything is going well for introverts they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard resulting in them feeling relaxed and content 91 93 93 complications to the extraversion happiness correlation edit though extraversion has consistently been shown to have a strong correlation with happiness and well being these findings are complicated by the presence of other personality traits that act as strong indicators of happiness neuroticism and extraversion edit in multiple studies neuroticism has been shown to have an equal if not larger impact on happiness and subjective well being than extraversion one study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability neuroticism 91 94 93 the results showed no significant difference between the happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts in this study neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well being likewise in later studies researchers used assessment scales to test for categories such as self esteem and life goal orientation which they had positively correlated with happiness participants responses to these scales suggested that neuroticism actually had a larger impact than extraversion in measures of well being 91 95 93 91 96 93 other big 5 factors and extraversion edit though extraversion and neuroticism seem to have the largest effect on personal happiness other big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well being for example one study showed that conscientiousness and agreeableness correlated about 0 20 with subjective well being 91 97 93 while the effect of these traits was not as strong as extraversion or neuroticism it is clear that they still have some impact on happiness outcomes similarly interactions between extraversion neuroticism and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective well being in one study researchers used three scales to assess subjective well being they found that extraversion only served as a predictor for one assessment in conjunction with neuroticism while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism 91 98 93 in addition to the importance of including other factors in happiness assessments this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor other contributing personality factors edit there is also evidence that other non trait elements of personality may correlate with happiness for instance one study demonstrated that various features of one s goals such as progress towards important goals or conflicts between them can affect both emotional and cognitive well being 91 99 93 several other researchers have also suggested that at least in more individualistic cultures having a coherent sense of one s personality and acting in a way that conforms to that self concept is positively related to well being 91 100 93 91 101 93 91 102 93 thus focusing solely on extraversion or even extraversion and neuroticism is likely to provide an incomplete picture of the relationship between happiness and personality culture edit in addition one s culture may also influence happiness and overall subjective well being the overall level of happiness fluctuates from culture to culture as does preferred expression of happiness comparing various international surveys across countries reveals that different nations and different ethnic groups within nations exhibit differences in average life satisfaction for example one researcher found that between 1958 and 1987 japanese life satisfaction fluctuated around 6 on a 10 point scale while denmark s fluctuated around 8 91 103 93 comparing ethnic groups within the united states another study found that european americans reported being significantly happier with their lives than asian americans 91 104 93 researchers have hypothesized a number of factors that could be responsible for these differences between countries including national differences in overall income levels self serving biases and self enhancement and
