article to reflect recent events or newly available information november 2021 flaming or roasting is the act of posting insults often including profanity or other offensive language on the internet 91 1 93 this term should not be confused with the term trolling which is the act of someone going online or in person and causing discord flaming emerged from the anonymity that internet forums provide cover for users to act more aggressively 91 2 93 anonymity can lead to disinhibition which results in the swearing offensive and hostile language characteristic of flaming lack of social cues less accountability of face to face communications textual mediation and deindividualization are also likely factors 91 3 93 deliberate flaming is carried out by individuals known as flamers which are specifically motivated to incite flaming these users specialize in flaming and target specific aspects of a controversial conversation while these behaviors may be typical or expected in certain types of forums they can have dramatic adverse effects in others flame wars can have a lasting impact on some internet communities where even once a flame war has concluded a division or even dissolution may occur 91 3 93 the pleasant commentaries within a chat room or message board can be limited by a war of words fight or flaming with the intent to seek out a negative reaction from the reader humphreys defines flaming as the use of hostile language online including swearing insults and otherwise offensive language etc 91 3 93 flaming by perpetrators within the online community is commonly received by messaging through text and rarely by face to face or video communication by basing their conversations on text and not taking full accountability as the flamer they have a reduced self awareness of others feelings emotions and reactions based on the comments that they provide within the virtual community the reader now has the perception that this flamer is difficult rude and possibly a bully the flamer may have limited social cues emotional intelligence to adapt to others reactions and lack of awareness of how they are being perceived their personal social norms may be considered disrespectful to the reader that has different social norms education and experience with what is and is not appropriate within virtual communities the individuals that create an environment of flaming and hostility lead the readers to disengage with the offender and may potentially leave the message board and chat room the continual use of flaming within the online community can create a disruptive and negative experience for those involved and can lead to limited involvement and engagement within the original chat room and program 91 4 93 contents 1 purpose 2 factors 3

links purpose edit social researchers have investigated flaming coming up with several different theories about the phenomenon 91 5 93 these include deindividuation and reduced awareness of other people s feelings online disinhibition effect 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 conformance to perceived norms 91 9 93 91 10 93 miscommunication caused by the lack of social cues available in face to face communication 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 and anti normative behavior 91 2 93 jacob borders in discussing participants internal modeling of a discussion says mental models are fuzzy incomplete and imprecisely stated furthermore within a single individual mental models change with time even during the flow of a single conversation the human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the context of a discussion as debate shifts so do the mental models even when only a single topic is being discussed each participant in a conversation employs a different mental model to interpret the subject fundamental assumptions differ but are never brought into the open goals are different but left unstated it is little wonder that compromise takes so long and even when consensus is reached the underlying assumptions may be fallacies that lead to laws and programs that fail the human mind is not adapted to understanding correctly the consequences implied by a mental model a mental model may be correct in structure and assumptions but even so the human mind either individually or as a group consensus is apt to draw the wrong implications for the future 91 14 93 thus online conversations often involve a variety of assumptions and motives unique to each individual user without social context users are often helpless to know the intentions of their counterparts in addition to the problems of conflicting mental models often present in online discussions the inherent lack of face to face communication online can encourage hostility professor norman johnson commenting on the propensity of internet posters to flame one another states the literature suggests that compared to face to face the increased incidence of flaming when using computer mediated communication is due to reductions in the transfer of social cues which decrease individuals concern for social evaluation and fear of social sanctions or reprisals when social identity and ingroup status are salient computer mediation can decrease flaming because individuals focus their attention on the social context and associated norms rather than themselves 91 15 93 a lack of social context creates an element of anonymity which allows users to feel insulated from the forms of punishment they might receive in a more conventional setting johnson identifies several precursors to flaming between users whom he refers to as negotiation partners since internet communication typically involves back and forth interactions similar to a negotiation flaming incidents usually arise in response to a perception of one or more negotiation partners being unfair perceived unfairness can include a lack of consideration for an individual s vested interests unfavorable treatment especially when the flamer has been considerate of other users and misunderstandings aggravated by the inability to convey subtle indicators like non verbal cues and facial expressions 91 15 93 factors edit there are multiple factors that play into why people would get involved with flaming for instance there is the anonymity factor and that people can use different means to have their identity hidden 91 16 93 through the hiding of one s identity people can build a new persona and act in a way that they normally would not when they have their identity known another factor in flaming is proactive aggression which is initiated without perceived threat or provocation and those who are recipients of flaming may counter with flaming of their own and utilize reactive aggression 91 16 93 another factor that goes into flaming are the different communication variables for instance offline communications networks can impact the way people act online and can lead them to engage in flaming 91 16 93 finally there is the factor of verbal aggression and how people who engage in verbal aggression will use those tactics when they engage in flaming online 91 16 93 flaming can range from subtle to extremely aggressive in online behaviors such as derogatory images certain emojis used in combination and even the use of capital letters these things can show a pattern of behavior used to convey certain emotions online victims should do their best to avoid fighting back in an attempt to prevent a war of words flaming extends past social media interactions flaming can also take place through emails and it may not matter so much whether someone calls an email a flame is based on whether she or he considers an email to be hostile aggressive insulting or offensive what matters is how the person receives the interaction so much is lost in translation when communicating online versus in person that it is hard to distinguish someone s intent 91 17 93 history edit evidence of debates which resulted in insults being exchanged quickly back and forth between two parties can be found throughout history arguments over the ratification of the united states constitution were often socially and emotionally heated and intense with many attacking one another through local newspapers such interactions have always been part of literary criticism for example ralph waldo emerson s contempt for jane austen s works often extended to the author herself with emerson describing her as without genius wit or knowledge of the world in turn thomas carlyle called emerson a hoary headed toothless baboon 91 18 93 in the modern era flaming was used at east coast engineering schools in the united states as a present participle in a crude expression to describe an irascible individual and by extension to such individuals on the earliest internet chat rooms and message boards internet flaming was mostly observed in usenet newsgroups although it was known to occur in the wwivnet and fidonet computer networks as well it was subsequently used in other parts of speech with much the same meaning the term flaming was seen on usenet newsgroups in the eighties where the start of a flame was sometimes indicated by typing flame on then flame off when the flame section of the post was complete this is a reference to both the human torch of the fantastic four who used those words when activating his flame abilities and to the way text processing programs of the time worked by placing commands before and after text to indicate how it should appear when printed the term flaming is documented in the hacker s dictionary 91 19 93 which in 1983 defined it as to speak rabidly or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with a patently ridiculous attitude the meaning of the word has diverged from this definition since then jerry pournelle in 1986 explained why he wanted a kill file for bix 91 20 93 whereas an open computer conference begins with a small number of well informed and highly interested participants it soon attracts others that s all right it s supposed to attract others where else would you get new ideas but soon it attracts too many far too many and some of them are not only ignorant but aggressively misinformed dilution takes place arguments replace discussions tempers are frayed the result is that while computer conferencing began by saving time it starts to eat up all the time it saved and more communications come from dozens of sources much of it is redundant some of it is stupid the user spends more and more time dealing with irrelevancies one day the user wakes up decides the initial euphoria was spurious and logs off never to return this is known as burnout and it s apparently quite common he added i noticed something most of the irritation came from a handful of people sometimes only one or two if i could only ignore them the computer conferences were still valuable alas it s not always easy to do 91 20 93 computer mediated communication cmc research has spent a significant amount of time and effort describing and predicting engagement in uncivil aggressive online communication specifically the literature has described aggressive insulting behavior as flaming which has been defined as hostile verbal behaviors 91 21 93 the uninhibited expression of hostility insults and ridicule and hostile comments directed towards a person or organization within the context of cmc 91 21 93 types edit flame trolling edit flame trolling is the posting of a provocative or offensive message known as flamebait 91 22 93 to a public internet discussion group such as a forum newsgroup or mailing list with the intent of provoking an angry response a flame or argument flamebait can provide the poster with a controlled trigger and response setting in which to anonymously engage in conflicts and indulge in aggressive behavior without facing the consequences that such behavior might bring in a face to face encounter 91 citation needed 93 in other instances flamebait may be used to reduce a forum s use by angering the forum users in 2012 it was announced that the us state department would start flame trolling jihadists as part of operation viral peace 91 23 93 among the characteristics of inflammatory behavior the use of entirely capitalized messages or the multiple repetition of exclamation marks along with profanity have been identified as typical 91 24 93 flame war edit a flame war results when multiple users engage in provocative responses to an original post which is sometimes flamebait flame wars often draw in many users including those trying to defuse the flame war and can quickly turn into a mass flame war that overshadows regular forum discussion resolving a flame war can be difficult as it is often hard to determine who is really responsible for the degradation of a reasonable discussion into a flame war someone who posts a contrary opinion in a strongly focused discussion forum may be easily labeled a baiter flamer or troll flame wars can become intense and can include death threats ad hominem invective and textual amplifiers but to some sociologists flame wars can actually bring people together what is being said in a flame war should not be taken too seriously since the harsh words are a part of flaming 91 25 93 an approach to resolving a flame war or responding to flaming is to communicate openly with the offending users acknowledging mistakes offering to help resolve the disagreement making clear reasoned arguments and even self deprecation have all been noted as worthwhile strategies to end such disputes however others prefer to simply ignore flaming noting that in many cases if the flamebait receives no attention it will quickly be forgotten as forum discussions carry on 91 18 93 unfortunately this can motivate trolls to intensify their activities creating additional distractions taking the bait or feeding the troll refers to someone who responds to the original message regardless of whether they are aware the original message was intended to provoke a response often when someone takes the bait others will point this out to them with the acronym yhbt which is short for you have been trolled or reply with don t feed the trolls forum users will usually not give the troll acknowledgement that just feeds the troll in sociology history or any kind of online ethnographic academic study flame wars as a corpus in a sts approach of controversies may be used to understand what is at stake in a community the idea is that the flame war drives the actors into abandoning a polite stance and forces them to engage into debate and to unveil otherwise concealed arguments in this respect the most interesting parts of an online corpus are the flame wars as outbursts of heated short and dense debates in an ocean of evenly distributed polite messages 91 26 93 mass flamewar edit a mass flamewar is a flamewar that grows out of a single post or comment into multiple other comments or posts quickly in the same area where the original post was in the mass flamewar usually lasts for multiple weeks or months after the first post was posted and died out political flaming edit political flaming typically occur when people have their views challenged and they seek to have their anger known through the covering of one s identity people may be more likely to engage in political flaming 91 16 93 in a 2015 study conducted by hutchens cicchirillo and hmielowski they found that those who were more experienced with political discussions either online or offline were more likely to indicate they would respond with a flame and they also found that verbal aggression also played a role in a person engaging in political flaming 91 16 93 corporate flaming edit corporate flaming is when a large number of critical comments usually aggressive or insulting are directed at a company s employees products or brands common causes include inappropriate behavior of company employees negative customer experiences inadequate care of customers and influencers violation of ethical principles along with apparent injustices and inappropriate reactions flame wars can result in reputational damage decreased consumer confidence drops in stock prices and company assets increased liabilities increased lawsuits and a decrease in customers influencers and sponsors based on an assessment of the damage companies can take years to recover from a flame war that may detract from their core purpose kayser notes that companies should prepare for possible flame wars by creating alerts for a predefined blacklist of words and monitoring fast growing topics about their company alternatively kayser points out that a flame war can lead to a positive experience for the company based on the content it could be shared across multiple platforms and increase company recognition social media fans followers brand presence purchases and brand loyalty therefore the type of marketing that results from a flame war can lead to higher profits and brand recognition on a broader scale nevertheless it is encouraged that when a company utilizes social media they should be aware that their content could be used in a flame war and should be treated as an emergency 91 27 93 examples edit any subject of a polarizing nature can feasibly cause flaming as one would expect in the medium of the internet technology is a common topic the perennial debates between users of competing operating systems such as windows classic mac os and macos operating system or operating systems based on the linux kernel and ios or android operating system users of intel and amd processors and users of the nintendo switch wii u playstation 4 and xbox one video game systems often escalate into seemingly unending flame wars also called software wars as each successive technology is released it develops its own outspoken fan base allowing arguments to begin anew popular culture continues to generate large amounts of flaming and countless flame wars across the internet such as the constant debates between fans of star trek and star wars ongoing discussion of current celebrities and television personalities within popular culture also frequently sparks debate in 2005 author anne rice became involved in a flame war of sorts on the review boards of online retailer amazon com after several reviewers posted scathing comments about her latest novel rice responded to the comments with her own lengthy response which was quickly met with more feedback from users 91 18 93 in 2007 tech expert kathy sierra was a victim of flaming as an image of her depicted as a mutilated body was spread around online forums in addition to the doctored photo being spread virally her social security number and home address were made public as well consequently sierra effectively gave up her technology career in response to the ensuing harassment and threats that she received as a result of the flaming 91 28 93 91 25 93 in november 2007 the popular audio visual discussion site avs forum temporarily closed its hd dvd and blu ray discussion forums because of as the site reported physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action between advocates of the rival formats 91 29 93 the 2016 presidential election saw a flame war take place between republican candidate donald trump and the democratic candidate hillary clinton the barbs exchanged between the two was highly publicized and is an example of political flaming and a flame war 91 30 93 legal implications edit flaming varies in severity and as such so too does the reaction of states in imposing any sort of sanction 91 31 93 laws vary from country to country but in most cases constant flaming can be considered cyber harassment 91 32 93 which can result in internet service provider action to prevent access to the site being flamed however as social networks become more and more closely connected to people and their real life the more harsh words may be considered defamation of the person 91 33 93 for instance a south korean identity verification law was created to help control flaming and to stop malicious use of the internet but opponents to the law argue that the law infringes on the right to free speech 91 2 93 see also edit cyberbullying dogpiling eristic forumwarz godwin s law it s okay to be white
