neuroticism from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search personality trait involving anxiety anger jealousy guilt or depression not to be confused with neurosis in the study of psychology neuroticism has been considered a fundamental personality trait for example in the big five approach to personality trait theory individuals with high scores for neuroticism are more likely than average to be moody and to experience such feelings as anxiety worry fear anger frustration envy jealousy guilt depressed mood and loneliness 91 1 93 such people are thought to respond worse to stressors and are more likely to interpret ordinary situations such as minor frustrations as appearing hopelessly difficult people with high scores on the neuroticism index are thought to be at risk of developing common mental disorders mood disorders anxiety disorders and substance use disorders have been studied 91 2 93 91 3 93 and the sorts of symptoms traditionally referred to as neuroses 91 4 93 contents 1 definition 2 measurement 3 mental disorder correlations 3 1 mood disorders 3 2 personality disorders 4 theories of causation 4 1 mental noise hypothesis 4 2 evolutionary psychology 4 3 terror management theory 4 4 genetic and environmental factors 5 age gender and geographic patterns 6 see also 7 references definition edit neuroticism is a trait in many models within personality theory but there is significant disagreement on its definition it is sometimes defined as a tendency for quick arousal when stimulated and slow relaxation from arousal especially with regard to negative emotional arousal another definition focuses on emotional instability and negativity or maladjustment in contrast to emotional stability and positivity or good adjustment it has also been defined in terms of lack of self control poor ability to manage psychological stress and a tendency to complain 91 5 93 various personality tests produce numerical scores and these scores are mapped onto the concept of neuroticism in various ways which has created some confusion in the scientific literature especially with regard to sub traits or facets 91 5 93 individuals who score low in neuroticism tend to be more emotionally stable and less reactive to stress they tend to be calm even tempered and less likely to feel tense or rattled although they are low in negative emotion they are not necessarily high in positive emotion being high in scores of positive emotion is generally an element of the independent trait of extraversion neurotic extraverts for example would experience high levels of both positive and negative emotional states a kind of emotional roller coaster 91 6 93 91 7 93 measurement edit like other personality traits neuroticism is typically viewed as a continuous dimension rather than a discrete state the extent of neuroticism is generally assessed using self report measures although peer reports and third party observation can also be used self report measures are either lexical 91 1 93 or based on statements 91 8 93 deciding which measure of either type to use in research is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties and the time and space constraints of the study being undertaken lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect neurotic traits such as anxiety envy jealousy and moodiness and are very space and time efficient for research purposes lewis goldberg 1992 91 9 93 developed a 20 word measure as part of his 100 word big five markers saucier 1994 91 10 93 developed a briefer 8 word measure as part of his 40 word mini markers thompson 2008 91 1 93 systematically revised these measures to develop the international english mini markers which has superior validity and reliability in populations both within and outside north america internal consistency reliability of the international english mini markers for the neuroticism emotional stability measure for native english speakers is reported as 0 84 and that for non native english speakers is 0 77 91 1 93 statement measures tend to comprise more words and hence consume more research instrument space than lexical measures respondents are asked the extent to which they for example remain calm under pressure or have frequent mood swings 91 8 93 while some statement based measures of neuroticism have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in north american populations to lexical measures their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations 91 11 93 for instance statements in colloquial north american english like feeling blue or being down in the dumps are sometimes hard for non native english speakers to understand neuroticism has also been studied from the perspective of gray s biopsychological theory of personality using a scale that measures personality along two dimensions the behavioural inhibition system bis and the behavioural activation system bas 91 12 93 91 13 93 the bis is thought to be related to sensitivity to punishment as well as avoidance motivation while the bas is thought to be related to sensitivity to reward as well as approach motivation neuroticism has been found to be positively correlated with the bis scale and negatively correlated with the bas scale 91 14 93 91 15 93 neuroticism has been included as one of the four dimensions that comprise core self evaluations one s fundamental appraisal of oneself along with locus of control self efficacy and self esteem 91 16 93 the concept of core self evaluations was first examined by judge locke and durham 1997 91 16 93 and since then evidence has been found to suggest these have the ability to predict several work outcomes specifically job satisfaction and job performance 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 there is a risk of selection bias in surveys of neuroticism a 2012 review of n scores said that many studies used samples drawn from privileged and educated populations 91 5 93 neuroticism is highly correlated with the startle reflex in response to fearful conditions and inversely correlated with it in response to disgusting or repulsive stimuli this suggests that neuroticism may increase vigilance where evasive action is possible but promote emotional blunting when escape is not an option 91 21 93 a measure of the startle reflex can be used to predict the trait neuroticism with good accuracy a fact that is thought by some to underlie the neurological basis of the trait the startle reflex is a reflex in response to a loud noise that one typically has no control over though anticipation can reduce the effect the strength of the reflex as well as the time until the reflex ceases can be used to predict neuroticism 91 citation needed 93 mental disorder correlations edit questions used in many neuroticism scales overlap with instruments used to assess mental disorders like anxiety disorders especially social anxiety disorder and mood disorders especially major depressive disorder which can sometimes confound efforts to interpret n scores and makes it difficult to determine whether each of neuroticism and the overlapping mental disorders might cause the other or if both might stem from other cause correlations can be identified 91 5 93 a 2013 meta analysis found that a wide range of clinical mental disorders are associated with elevated levels of neuroticism compared to levels in the general population 91 22 93 91 23 93 it found that high neuroticism is predictive for the development of anxiety disorders major depressive disorder psychosis and schizophrenia and is predictive but less so for substance use and non specific mental distress 91 2 93 these associations are smaller after adjustment for elevated baseline symptoms of the mental illnesses and psychiatric history 91 2 93 neuroticism has also been found to be associated with older age in 2007 mroczek amp spiro found that among older men upward trends in neuroticism over life as well as increased neuroticism overall both contributed to higher mortality rates 91 24 93 mood disorders edit disorders associated with elevated neuroticism include mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder anxiety disorders eating disorders schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder dissociative identity disorder and hypochondriasis mood disorders tend to have a much larger association with neuroticism than most other disorders 91 2 93 91 22 93 the five big studies have described children and adolescents with high neuroticism as anxious vulnerable tense easily frightened falling apart under stress guilt prone moody low in frustration tolerance and insecure in relationships with others which includes both traits concerning the prevalence of negative emotions as well as the response to these negative emotions 91 25 93 neuroticism in adults similarly was found to be associated with the frequency of self reported problems 91 25 93 these associations can vary with culture for example adams found that among upper middle class american teenaged girls neuroticism was associated with eating disorders and self harm but among ghanaian teenaged girls higher neuroticism was associated with magical thinking and extreme fear of enemies 91 24 93 personality disorders edit a 2004 meta analysis attempted to analyze personality disorders in light of the five factor personality theory and failed to find meaningful discriminations it did find that elevated neuroticism is correlated with many personality disorders 91 26 93 theories of causation edit mental noise hypothesis edit studies have found that the mean reaction times will not differ between individuals high in neuroticism and those low in neuroticism but that with individuals high in neuroticism there is considerably more trial to trial variability in performance reflected in reaction time standard deviations in other words on some trials neurotic individuals are faster than average and on others they are slower than average it has been suggested that this variability reflects noise in the individual s information processing systems or instability of basic cognitive operations such as regulation processes and further that this noise originates from two sources mental preoccupations and reactivity processes 91 27 93 flehmig et al 2007 studied mental noise in terms of everyday behaviours using the cognitive failures questionnaire which is a self report measure of the frequency of slips and lapses of attention a slip is an error by commission and a lapse is an error by omission this scale was correlated with two well known measures of neuroticism the bis bas scale and the eysenck personality questionnaire results indicated that the cfq ua cognitive failures questionnaire unintended activation subscale was most strongly correlated with neuroticism r 40 91 clarification needed 93 and explained the most variance 16 compared to overall cfq scores which only explained 7 the authors interpret these findings as suggesting that mental noise is highly specific in nature as it is related most strongly to attention slips triggered endogenously by associative memory in other words this may suggest that mental noise is mostly task irrelevant cognitions such as worries and preoccupations 91 28 93 evolutionary psychology edit see also evolutionary psychology the theory of evolution may also explain differences in personality 91 29 93 for example one of the evolutionary approaches to depression focuses on neuroticism and finds that heightened reactivity to negative outcomes may have had a survival benefit and that furthermore a positive relationship has been found between neuroticism level and success in university with the precondition that the negative effects of neuroticism are also successfully coped with 91 30 93 likewise a heightened reactivity to positive events may have had reproductive advantages selecting for heightened reactivity generally 91 22 93 nettle contends that evolution selected for higher levels of neuroticism until the negative effects of neuroticism outweighed its benefits resulting in selection for a certain optimal level of neuroticism this type of selection will result in a normal distribution of neuroticism so the extremities of the distribution will be individuals with excessive neuroticism or too low neuroticism for what is optimal and the ones with excessive neuroticism would therefore be more vulnerable to the negative effects of depression and nettle gives this as the explanation for the existence of depression rather than hypothesizing as others have that depression itself has any evolutionary benefit 91 30 93 some research has found that neuroticism in modern societies is positively correlated with reproductive success in females but not in males a possible explanation may be that neuroticism in females comes at the expense of formal education which is correlated with lower fertility and correlates with unplanned and adolescent pregnancies 91 31 93 terror management theory edit according to terror management theory tmt neuroticism is primarily caused by insufficient anxiety buffers against unconscious death anxiety 91 32 93 these buffers consist of cultural worldviews that impart life with a sense of enduring meaning such as social continuity beyond one s death future legacy and afterlife beliefs a sense of personal value or the self esteem in the cultural worldview context an enduring sense of meaning while tmt agrees with standard evolutionary psychology accounts that the roots of neuroticism in homo sapiens or its ancestors are likely in adaptive sensitivities to negative outcomes it posits that once homo sapiens achieved a higher level of self awareness neuroticism increased enormously becoming largely a spandrel a non adaptive byproduct of our adaptive intelligence which resulted in a crippling awareness of death that threatened to undermine other adaptive functions this overblown anxiety thus needed to be buffered via intelligently creative but largely fictitious and arbitrary notions of cultural meaning and personal value since highly religious or supernatural conceptions of the world provide cosmic personal significance and literal immortality they are deemed to offer the most efficient buffers against death anxiety and neuroticism thus historically the shift to more materialistic and secular cultures starting in the neolithic and culminating in the industrial revolution is deemed to have increased neuroticism 91 32 93 genetic and environmental factors edit a 2013 review found that neuroticism is the product of the interplay between genetic and environmental influences heritability estimates typically range from 40 to 60 91 3 93 the effect size of these genetic differences remain largely the same throughout development but the hunt for any specific genes that control neuroticism levels has turned out to be difficult and hardly successful so far 91 3 93 on the other hand with regards to environmental influences adversities during development such as emotional neglect and sexual abuse were found to be positively associated with neuroticism 91 3 93 however sustained change in neuroticism and mental health are rather rare or have only small effects 91 3 93 in the july 1951 article the inheritance of neuroticism by hans j eysenck and donald prell it was reported that some 80 per cent of individual differences in neuroticism are due to heredity and only 20 percent are due to environment the factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole neurotic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined 91 33 93 in children and adolescents psychologists speak of temperamental negative affectivity that during adolescence develops into the neuroticism personality domain 91 24 93 mean neuroticism levels change throughout the lifespan as a function of personality maturation and social roles 91 34 93 91 35 93 but also the expression of new genes 91 36 93 neuroticism in particular was found to decrease as a result of maturity by decreasing through age 40 and then leveling off 91 24 93 generally speaking the influence of environments on neuroticism increases over the lifespan 91 36 93 although people probably select and evoke experiences based on their neuroticism levels 91 25 93 the emergent field of imaging genetics which investigates the role of genetic variation in the structure and function of the brain has studied certain genes suggested to be related to neuroticism and the one studied so far concerning this topic has been the serotonin transporter linked promoter region gene known as 5 httlpr which is transcribed into a serotonin transporter that removes serotonin 91 22 93 it has been found that compared to the long l variant of 5 httlpr the short s variant has reduced promoter activity and the first study on this subject has shown that the presence of the s variant 5 httlpr has been found to result in higher amygdala activity from seeing angry or fearful faces while doing a non emotional task with further studies confirming that the s variant 5 httlpr result greater amygdala activity in response to negative stimuli but there have also been null findings 91 22 93 a meta analysis of 14 studies has shown that this gene has a moderate effect size and accounts for 10 of the phenotypic difference however the relationship between brain activity and genetics may not be completely straightforward due to other factors with suggestions made that cognitive control and stress may moderate the effect of the gene there are two models that have been proposed to explain the type of association between the 5 httlpr gene and amygdala activity the phasic activation model proposes that the gene controls amygdala activity levels in response to stress whereas the tonic activation model on the other hand proposes that the gene controls baseline amygdala activity another gene that has been suggested for further study to be related to neuroticism is the catechol o methyltransferase comt gene 91 22 93 the anxiety and maladaptive stress responses that are aspects of neuroticism have been the subject of intensive study dysregulation of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and glucocorticoid system and influence of different versions of the serotonin transporter and 5 ht1a receptor genes may influence the development of neuroticism in combination with environmental effects like the quality of upbringing 91 22 93 91 26 93 neuroimaging studies with fmri have had mixed results with some finding that increased activity in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex brain regions associated with arousal is correlated with high neuroticism scores as is activation of the associations have also been found with the medial prefrontal cortex insular cortex and hippocampus while other studies have found no correlations 91 22 93 91 37 93 further studies have been conducted trying to tighten experimental design by using genetics to add additional differentiation among participants as well as twin study models 91 22 93 a related trait behavioral inhibition or inhibition to the unfamiliar has received attention as the trait concerning withdrawal or fear from unfamiliar situations which is generally measured through observation of child behavior in response to for example encountering unfamiliar individuals this trait in particular has been hypothesized to be related to amygdala function but the evidence so far has been mixed 91 25 93 age gender and geographic patterns edit a 2013 review found that groups associated with higher levels of neuroticism are young adults who are at high risk for mood disorders research in large samples has shown that levels of neuroticism are higher in women than men 91 22 93 neuroticism is found to decrease slightly with age 91 38 93 the same study noted that no functional mri studies have yet been performed to investigate these differences calling for more research 91 22 93 a 2010 review found personality differences between genders to be between small and moderate the largest of those differences being in the traits of agreeableness and neuroticism 91 39 93 many personality traits were found to have had larger personality differences between men and women in developed countries compared to less developed countries and differences in three traits extraversion neuroticism and people versus thing orientation showed differences that remained consistent across different levels of economic development which is also consistent with the possible influence of biologic factors 91 39 93 three cross cultural studies have revealed higher levels of female neuroticism across almost all nations 91 39 93 geographically a 2016 review said that in the us neuroticism is highest in the mid atlantic states and southwards and declines westward while openness to experience is highest in ethnically diverse regions of the mid atlantic new england the west coast and cities likewise in the uk neuroticism is lowest in urban areas generally geographical studies find correlations between low neuroticism and entrepreneurship and economic vitality and correlations between high neuroticism and poor health outcomes the review found that the causal relationship between regional cultural and economic conditions and psychological health is unclear 91 40 93 neuroticism was defined as one of the possible factors for internet addiction disorder development 91 41 93 investigation of the instagram users showed the preference of cosmetic products and intolerance of weapons among highly neurotic users 91 42 93 there is a strong correlation between bruxism and neuroticism more severe bruxism is associated with a higher degree of neuroticism 91 43 93
