considered synonymous with sociopathy is characterized by persistent antisocial behavior impaired empathy and remorse and bold disinhibited and egotistical traits 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 different conceptions of psychopathy have been used throughout history that are only partly overlapping and may sometimes be contradictory 91 4 93 hervey m cleckley an american psychiatrist influenced the initial diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality reaction disturbance in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm as did american psychologist george e partridge 91 5 93 the dsm and international classification of diseases icd subsequently introduced the diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder aspd and dissocial personality disorder dpd respectively stating that these diagnoses have been referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy the creation of aspd and dpd was driven by the fact that many of the classic traits of psychopathy were impossible to measure objectively 91 4 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 canadian psychologist robert d hare later repopularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology with his psychopathy checklist 91 4 93 91 7 93 91 10 93 91 11 93 although no psychiatric or psychological organization has sanctioned a diagnosis titled psychopathy assessments of psychopathic characteristics are widely used in criminal justice settings in some nations and may have important consequences for individuals 91 specify 93 the study of psychopathy is an active field of research the term is also used by the general public popular press and in fictional portrayals 91 11 93 91 12 93 while the term is often employed in common usage along with crazy insane and mentally ill there is a categorical difference

bibliography 14 external links history edit main article history of psychopathy etymology edit the word psychopathy is a joining of the greek words psyche soul and pathos suffering feeling 91 14 93 the first documented use is from 1847 in germany as psychopatisch 91 15 93 and the noun psychopath has been traced to 1885 91 16 93 in medicine patho has a more specific meaning of disease thus pathology has meant the study of disease since 1610 and psychopathology has meant the study of mental disorder in general since 1847 a sense of a subject of pathology morbid excessive is attested from 1845 91 17 93 including the phrase pathological liar from 1891 in the medical literature the term psychopathy initially had a very general meaning referring to all sorts of mental disorders and social aberrations popularised from 1891 in germany by koch s concept of psychopathic inferiority psychopathische minderwertigkeiten some medical dictionaries still define psychopathy in both a narrow and broad sense such as medlineplus from the u s national library of medicine 91 18 93 on the other hand stedman s medical dictionary defines psychopath only as a former designation for a person with an antisocial type of personality disorder 91 19 93 the term psychosis was also used in germany from 1841 originally in a very general sense the suffix osis meant in this case abnormal condition this term or its adjective psychotic would come to refer to the more severe mental disturbances and then specifically to mental states or disorders characterized by hallucinations delusions or in some other sense markedly out of touch with reality 91 20 93 the slang term psycho has been traced to a shortening of the adjective psychopathic from 1936 and from 1942 as a shortening of the noun psychopath 91 21 93 but it is also used as shorthand for psychotic or crazed 91 22 93 the media usually uses the term psychopath to designate any criminal whose offenses are particularly abhorrent and unnatural but that is not its original or general psychiatric meaning 91 23 93 sociopathy edit the word element socio has been commonly used in compound words since around 1880 91 24 93 91 25 93 the term sociopathy may have been first introduced in 1909 in germany by biological psychiatrist karl birnbaum and in 1930 in the us by educational psychologist george e partridge as an alternative to the concept of psychopathy 91 24 93 it was used to indicate that the defining feature is violation of social norms or antisocial behavior and may be social or biological in origin 91 26 93 91 27 93 91 28 93 91 29 93 the term is used in various different ways in contemporary usage robert hare stated in the popular science book snakes in suits that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably but in some cases the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis whereas in other cases the two terms may be used with different meanings that reflect the user s views on its origins and determinants hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological biological and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors 91 2 93 hare also provides his own definitions he describes psychopathy as lacking a sense of empathy or morality but sociopathy as only differing from the average person in the sense of right and wrong 91 30 93 91 31 93 precursors edit ancient writings that have been connected to psychopathic traits include deuteronomy 21 18 21 which was written around 700 bce and a description of an unscrupulous man by the greek philosopher theophrastus around 300 bce 91 32 93 the concept of psychopathy has been indirectly connected to the early 19th century work of pinel 1801 mania without delirium and pritchard 1835 moral insanity although historians have largely discredited the idea of a direct equivalence 91 33 93 psychopathy originally described any illness of the mind but found its application to a narrow subset of mental conditions when it was used toward the end of the 19th century by the german psychiatrist julius koch 1891 to describe various behavioral and moral dysfunction in the absence of an obvious mental illness or intellectual disability he applied the term psychopathic inferiority psychopathischen minderwertigkeiten to various chronic conditions and character disorders and his work would influence the later conception of the personality disorder 91 4 93 91 34 93 the term psychopathic came to be used to describe a diverse range of dysfunctional or antisocial behavior and mental and sexual deviances including at the time homosexuality it was often used to imply an underlying constitutional or genetic origin disparate early descriptions likely set the stage for modern controversies about the definition of psychopathy 91 4 93 20th century edit psychoanalyst walter c langer described adolf hitler as a neurotic psychopath an influential figure in shaping modern american conceptualizations of psychopathy was american psychiatrist hervey cleckley in his classic monograph the mask of sanity 1941 cleckley drew on a small series of vivid case studies of psychiatric patients at a veterans administration hospital in georgia to provide a description for psychopathy cleckley used the metaphor of the mask to refer to the tendency of psychopaths to appear confident personable and well adjusted compared to most psychiatric patients while revealing underlying pathology through their actions over time cleckley formulated sixteen criteria for psychopathy 91 4 93 the scottish psychiatrist david henderson had also been influential in europe from 1939 in narrowing the diagnosis 91 35 93 the diagnostic category of sociopathic personality in early editions of the diagnostic and statistical manual dsm 91 36 93 had some key similarities to cleckley s ideas though in 1980 when renamed antisocial personality disorder some of the underlying personality assumptions were removed 91 7 93 in 1980 canadian psychologist robert d hare introduced an alternative measure the psychopathy checklist pcl based largely on cleckley s criteria which was revised in 1991 pcl r 91 37 93 91 38 93 and is the most widely used measure of psychopathy 91 39 93 there are also several self report tests with the psychopathic personality inventory ppi used more often among these in contemporary adult research 91 4 93 famous individuals have sometimes been diagnosed albeit at a distance as psychopaths as one example out of many possible from history in a 1972 version of a secret report originally prepared for the office of strategic services in 1943 and which may have been intended to be used as propaganda 91 40 93 91 41 93 non medical psychoanalyst walter c langer suggested adolf hitler was probably a psychopath 91 42 93 however others have not drawn this conclusion clinical forensic psychologist glenn walters argues that hitler s actions do not warrant a diagnosis of psychopathy as although he showed several characteristics of criminality he was not always egocentric callously disregarding of feelings or lacking impulse control and there is no proof he could not learn from mistakes 91 43 93 definition edit concepts edit psychopaths are social predators who charm manipulate and ruthlessly plow their way through life leaving a broad trail ofbroken hearts shattered expectations and empty wallets completely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others they selfishly take what they want and do as they please violating social norms and expectations without theslightest sense of guilt or regret robert d hare 1993 p xi 91 44 93 there are multiple conceptualizations of psychopathy 91 4 93 including cleckleyan psychopathy hervey cleckley s conception entailing bold disinhibited behavior and feckless disregard and criminal psychopathy a meaner more aggressive and disinhibited conception explicitly entailing persistent and sometimes serious criminal behavior the latter conceptualization is typically used as the modern clinical concept and assessed by the psychopathy checklist 91 4 93 the label psychopath may have implications and stigma related to decisions about punishment severity for criminal acts medical treatment civil commitments etc efforts have therefore been made to clarify the meaning of the term 91 4 93 the triarchic model 91 1 93 suggests that different conceptions of psychopathy emphasize three observable characteristics to various degrees analyses have been made with respect to the applicability of measurement tools such as the psychopathy checklist pcl pcl r and psychopathic personality inventory ppi to this model 91 1 93 91 4 93 boldness low fear including stress tolerance toleration of unfamiliarity and danger and high self confidence and social assertiveness the pcl r measures this relatively poorly and mainly through facet 1 of factor 1 similar to ppi fearless dominance may correspond to differences in the amygdala and other neurological systems associated with fear 91 1 93 91 4 93 disinhibition poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight lacking affect and urge control demand for immediate gratification and poor behavioral restraints similar to pcl r factor 2 and ppi impulsive antisociality may correspond to impairments in frontal lobe systems that are involved in such control 91 1 93 91 4 93 meanness lacking empathy and close attachments with others disdain of close attachments use of cruelty to gain empowerment exploitative tendencies defiance of authority and destructive excitement seeking the pcl r in general is related to this but in particular some elements in factor 1 similar to ppi but also includes elements of subscales in impulsive antisociality 91 1 93 91 4 93 measurement edit an early and influential analysis from harris and colleagues indicated that a discrete category or taxon may underlie pcl r psychopathy allowing it to be measured and analyzed however this was only found for the behavioral factor 2 items they identified child problem behaviors adult criminal behavior did not support the existence of a taxon 91 45 93 marcus john and edens more recently performed a series of statistical analyses on ppi scores and concluded that psychopathy may best be conceptualized as having a dimensional latent structure like depression 91 46 93 marcus et al repeated the study on a larger sample of prisoners using the pcl r and seeking to rule out other experimental or statistical issues that may have produced the previously different findings 91 47 93 they again found that the psychopathy measurements do not appear to be identifying a discrete type a taxon they suggest that while for legal or other practical purposes an arbitrary cut off point on trait scores might be used there is actually no clear scientific evidence for an objective point of difference by which to label some people psychopaths in other words a psychopath may be more accurately described as someone who is relatively psychopathic 91 4 93 the pcl r was developed for research not clinical forensic diagnosis and even for research purposes to improve understanding of the underlying issues it is necessary to examine dimensions of personality in general rather than only a constellation of traits 91 4 93 91 48 93 personality dimensions edit studies have linked psychopathy to alternative dimensions such as antagonism high conscientiousness low and anxiousness low 91 49 93 psychopathy has also been linked to high psychoticism a theorized dimension referring to tough aggressive or hostile tendencies aspects of this that appear associated with psychopathy are lack of socialization and responsibility impulsivity sensation seeking in some cases and aggression 91 50 93 91 51 93 91 52 93 otto kernberg from a particular psychoanalytic perspective believed psychopathy should be considered as part of a spectrum of pathological narcissism that would range from narcissistic personality on the low end malignant narcissism in the middle and psychopathy at the high end 91 52 93 psychopathy narcissism and machiavellianism three personality traits that are together referred to as the dark triad share certain characteristics such as a callous manipulative interpersonal style 91 53 93 the dark tetrad refers to these traits with the addition of sadism 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 91 57 93 91 58 93 91 59 93 criticism of current conceptions edit the current conceptions of psychopathy have been criticized for being poorly conceptualized highly subjective and encompassing a wide variety of underlying disorders dorothy otnow lewis has written the concept and subsequent reification of the diagnosis psychopathy has to this author s mind hampered the understanding of criminality and violence according to hare in many cases one need not even meet the patient just rummage through his records to determine what items seemed to fit nonsense to this writer s mind psychopathy and its synonyms e g sociopathy and antisocial personality are lazy diagnoses over the years the authors team has seen scores of offenders who prior to evaluation by the authors were dismissed as psychopaths or the like detailed comprehensive psychiatric neurological and neuropsychological evaluations have uncovered a multitude of signs symptoms and behaviors indicative of such disorders as bipolar mood disorder schizophrenia spectrum disorders complex partial seizures dissociative identity disorder parasomnia and of course brain damage dysfunction 91 60 93 half of the hare psychopathy checklist consists of symptoms of mania hypomania and frontal lobe dysfunction which frequently results in underlying disorders being dismissed 91 61 93 hare s conception of psychopathy has also been criticized for being reductionist dismissive tautological and ignorant of context as well as the dynamic nature of human behavior 91 62 93 some have called for rejection of the concept altogether due to its vague subjective and judgmental nature that makes it prone to misuse 91 63 93 psychopathic individuals do not show regret or remorse this was thought to be due to an inability to generate this emotion in response to negative outcomes however in 2016 people with antisocial personality disorder and dissocial personality disorder were found to experience regret but did not use the regret to guide their choice in behavior there was no lack of regret but a problem to think through a range of potential actions and estimating the outcome values 91 64 93 in an experiment published in march 2007 at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio r damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these brain damaged patients coldly came up with end justifies the means answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with typically functioning brains according to adrian raine a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this study s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability 91 citation needed 93 signs and symptoms edit socially psychopathy typically involves extensive callous and manipulative self serving behaviors with no regard for others and often is associated with repeated delinquency crime and violence mentally impairments in processes related to affect and cognition particularly socially related mental processes have also been found developmentally symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder and suggests at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development 91 65 93 primary features edit disagreement exists over which features should be considered as part of psychopathy with researchers identifying around 40 traits supposedly indicative of the construct 91 66 93 91 67 93 though the following characteristics are almost universally considered central core traits edit cooke and michie 2001 91 68 93 proposed a three factor model of the psychopathy checklist revised which has seen widespread application in other measures e g youth psychopathic traits inventory 91 69 93 antisocial process screening device 91 70 93 arrogant and deceitful interpersonal style impression management or superficial charm inflated and grandiose sense of self worth pathological lying deceit and manipulation for personal gain deficient affective experience lack of remorse or guilt shallow affect coldness and unemotionality callousness and lack of empathy and failure to accept responsibility for own actions impulsive and irresponsible lifestyle impulsivity sensation seeking and risk taking irresponsible and unreliable behavior financially parasitic lifestyle and lack of realistic long term goals low anxiety and fearlessness edit cleckley s 1941 original description of psychopathy included the absence of nervousness and neurotic disorders and later theorists referred to psychopaths as fearless or thick skinned 91 71 93 while it is often claimed that the pcl r does not include low anxiety or fearlessness such features do contribute to the scoring of the facet 1 interpersonal items mainly through self assurance unrealistic optimism brazenness and imperturbability 91 72 93 indeed while self report studies have been inconsistent using the two factor model of the pcl r studies which separate factor 1 into interpersonal and affective facets more regularly show modest associations between facet 1 and low anxiety boldness and fearless dominance especially items assessing glibness charm and grandiosity 91 73 93 91 74 93 91 14 93 when both psychopathy and low anxiety boldness are measured using interviews both interpersonal and affective facets are both associated with fearlessness and lack of internalizing disorders 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 the importance of low anxiety fearlessness to psychopathy has historically been underscored through behavioral and physiological studies showing diminished responses to threatening stimuli interpersonal and affective facets both contributing 91 19 93 however it is not known whether this is reflected in reduced experience of state fear or where it reflects impaired detection and response to threat related stimuli 91 27 93 moreover such deficits in threat responding are known to be reduced or even abolished when attention is focused on the threatening stimuli 91 22 93 offending edit criminality edit psychopathy is strongly correlated with crime violence and antisocial behavior in terms of simple correlations the pcl r manual states an average score of 22 1 has been found in north american prisoner samples and that 20 5 scored 30 or higher an analysis of prisoner samples from outside north america found a somewhat lower average value of 17 5 studies have found that psychopathy scores correlated with repeated imprisonment detention in higher security disciplinary infractions and substance misuse 91 75 93 91 76 93 psychopathy as measured with the pcl r in institutional settings shows in meta analyses small to moderate effect sizes with institutional misbehavior postrelease crime or postrelease violent crime with similar effects for the three outcomes individual studies give similar results for adult offenders forensic psychiatric samples community samples and youth the pcl r is poorer at predicting sexual re offending this small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history which are well established but very general risk factors the aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves for example factor 1 of the pcl r and fearless dominance of the ppi r have smaller or no relationship to crime including violent crime in contrast factor 2 and impulsive antisociality of the ppi r are associated more strongly with criminality factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the pcl r as a whole the antisocial facet of the pcl r is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which together with results regarding the ppi r which by design does not include past criminal behavior suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor thus the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime 91 4 93 91 77 93 violence edit studies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and violence and the pcl r emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior researchers however have noted that psychopathy is dissociable from and not synonymous with violence 91 4 93 91 78 93 it has been suggested that psychopathy is associated with instrumental aggression also known as predatory proactive or cold blooded aggression a form of aggression characterized by reduced emotion and conducted with a goal differing from but facilitated by the commission of harm 91 79 93 91 80 93 one conclusion in this regard was made by a 2002 study of homicide offenders which reported that the homicides committed by homicidal offenders with psychopathy were almost always 93 3 primarily instrumental significantly more than the proportion 48 4 of those committed by non psychopathic homicidal offenders with the instrumentality of the homicide also correlated with the total pcl r score of the offender as well as their scores on the factor 1 interpersonal affective dimension however contrary to the equating of this to mean exclusively in cold blood more than a third of the homicides committed by psychopathic offenders involved some component of emotional reactivity as well 91 81 93 in any case fbi profilers indicate that serious victim injury is generally an emotional offense and some research supports this at least with regard to sexual offending one study has found more serious offending by non psychopathic offenders on average than by offenders with psychopathy e g more homicides versus more armed robbery and property offenses and another that the affective facet of the pcl r predicted reduced offense seriousness 91 4 93 studies on perpetrators of domestic violence find that abusers have high rates of psychopathy with the prevalence estimated to be at around 15 30 furthermore the commission of domestic violence is correlated with factor 1 of the pcl r which describes the emotional deficits and the callous and exploitative interpersonal style found in psychopathy the prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy such as callousness remorselessness and a lack of close interpersonal bonds predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated i e instrumentally aggressive rather than a case of emotional aggression and therefore may not be amenable to the types of psychosocial interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators 91 80 93 91 82 93 some clinicians suggest that assessment of the construct of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence risk assessment a large systematic review and meta regression found that the pcl performed the poorest out of nine tools for predicting violence in addition studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures including the pcl show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators there are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the pcl r and some of these are considerably easier quicker and less expensive to administer this may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age gender number of previous convictions and age of first conviction some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals identify quick changes that may help short term management identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores nonetheless the pcl r may continue to be popular for risk assessment because of its pioneering role and the large amount of research done using it 91 4 93 91 83 93 91 84 93 91 85 93 91 86 93 91 87 93 91 88 93 the federal bureau of investigation reports that psychopathic behavior is consistent with traits common to some serial killers including sensation seeking a lack of remorse or guilt impulsivity the need for control and predatory behavior 91 89 93 it has also been found that the homicide victims of psychopathic offenders were disproportionately female in comparison to the more equitable gender distribution of victims of non psychopathic offenders 91 81 93 sexual offending edit psychopathy has been associated with commission of sexual crime with some researchers arguing that it is correlated with a preference for violent sexual behavior a 2011 study of conditional releases for canadian male federal offenders found that psychopathy was related to more violent and non violent offences but not more sexual offences 91 citation needed 93 for child molesters psychopathy was associated with more offences 91 90 93 a study on the relationship between psychopathy scores and types of aggression in a sample of sexual murderers in which 84 2 of the sample had pcl r scores above 20 and 47 4 above 30 found that 82 4 of those with scores above 30 had engaged in sadistic violence defined as enjoyment indicated by self report or evidence compared to 52 6 of those with scores below 30 and total pcl r and factor 1 scores correlated significantly with sadistic violence 91 91 93 91 92 93 despite this it is reported that offenders with psychopathy both sexual and non sexual offenders are about 2 5 times more likely to be granted conditional release compared to non psychopathic offenders 91 90 93 hildebrand and colleagues 2004 have uncovered an interaction between psychopathy and deviant sexual interests wherein those high in psychopathy who also endorsed deviant sexual interests were more likely to recidivate sexually 91 93 93 a subsequent meta analysis has consolidated such a result 91 94 93 in considering the issue of possible reunification of some sex offenders into homes with a non offending parent and children it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be assessed on the pcl r and if they score 18 or higher then they should be excluded from any consideration of being placed in a home with children under any circumstances 91 95 93 there is however increasing concern that pcl scores are too inconsistent between different examiners including in its use to evaluate sex offenders 91 96 93 other offending edit see also 160 in the workplace the possibility of psychopathy has been associated with organized crime economic crime and war crimes terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others a lack of remorse or guilt and blame externalization 91 citation needed 93 however john horgan author of the psychology of terrorism argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely for example to soldiers in wars coordinated terrorist activity requires organization loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause traits such as a self centered disposition unreliability poor behavioral controls and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism 91 97 93 91 98 93 it may be that a significant portion of people with psychopathy are socially successful and tend to express their antisocial behavior through more covert avenues such as social manipulation or white collar crime such individuals are sometimes referred to as successful psychopaths and may not necessarily always have extensive histories of traditional antisocial behavior as characteristic of traditional psychopathy 91 99 93 childhood and adolescent precursors edit the pcl yv is an adaptation of the pcl r for individuals aged 13 18 years it is like the pcl r done by a trained rater based on an interview and an examination of criminal and other records the antisocial process screening device apsd is also an adaptation of the pcl r it can be administered by parents or teachers for individuals aged 6 13 years high psychopathy scores for both juveniles as measured with these instruments and adults as measured with the pcl r and other measurement tools have similar associations with other variables including similar ability in predicting violence and criminality 91 4 93 91 100 93 91 101 93 juvenile psychopathy may also be associated with more negative emotionality such as anger hostility anxiety and depression 91 4 93 91 102 93 psychopathic traits in youth typically comprise three factors callous unemotional narcissism and impulsivity irresponsibility 91 103 93 91 104 93 there is positive correlation between early negative life events of the ages 0 4 and the emotion based aspects of psychopathy 91 105 93 there are moderate to high correlations between psychopathy rankings from late childhood to early adolescence the correlations are considerably lower from early or mid adolescence to adulthood in one study most of the similarities were on the impulsive and antisocial behavior scales of those adolescents who scored in the top 5 highest psychopathy scores at age 13 less than one third 29 were classified as psychopathic at age 24 some recent studies have also found poorer ability at predicting long term adult offending 91 4 93 91 106 93 conduct disorder edit main article conduct disorder conduct disorder is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behavior in childhood and or adolescence and may be seen as a precursor to aspd some researchers have speculated that there are two subtypes of conduct disorder which mark dual developmental pathways to adult psychopathy 91 4 93 91 107 93 91 108 93 the dsm allows differentiating between childhood onset before age 10 and adolescent onset at age 10 and later childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment for many but not all childhood onset is associated with what is in terrie moffitt s developmental theory of crime referred to as life course persistent antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short term antisocial behavior 91 4 93 it has been suggested that the combination of early onset conduct disorder and adhd may be associated with life course persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy there is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone however it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have adhd some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition similar to that of adults with psychopathy they may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with psychopathy proponents of different types dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model 91 4 93 the dsm 5 includes a specifier for those with conduct disorder who also display a callous unemotional interpersonal style across multiple settings and relationships 91 105 93 the specifier is based on research which suggests that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for the specifier tend to have a more severe form of the disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment proponents of different types dimensions of psychopathy have seen this as possibly corresponding to adult primary psychopathy and increased boldness and or meanness in the triarchic model 91 4 93 91 109 93 mental traits edit cognition edit dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala regions of the brain have been associated with specific learning impairments in psychopathy since the 1980s scientists have linked traumatic brain injury including damage to these regions with violent and psychopathic behavior patients with damage in such areas resembled psychopathic individuals whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning while those with adult acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also impair stimulus reinforced learning in psychopaths whether punishment based or reward based people scoring 25 or higher in the pcl r with an associated history of violent behavior appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their uncinate fasciculus white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex there is evidence from dt mri of breakdowns in the white matter connections between these two important areas 91 110 93 91 111 93 91 112 93 although some studies have suggested inverse relationships between psychopathy and intelligence including with regards to verbal iq hare and neumann state that a large literature demonstrates at most only a weak association between psychopathy and iq noting that the early pioneer cleckley included good intelligence in his checklist due to selection bias since many of his patients were well educated and from middle class or upper class backgrounds and that there is no obvious theoretical reason why the disorder described by cleckley or other clinicians should be related to intelligence some psychopaths are bright others less so studies also indicate that different aspects of the definition of psychopathy e g interpersonal affective emotion behavioral and lifestyle components can show different links to intelligence and the result can depend on the type of intelligence assessment e g verbal creative practical analytical 91 12 93 91 78 93 91 113 93 91 114 93 emotion recognition and empathy edit a large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues from other people more precisely an impaired emotional empathy in the recognition of and response to facial expressions body gestures and vocal tones of fear sadness pain and happiness 91 115 93 91 65 93 this impaired recognition and reduced autonomic responsiveness might be partly accounted for by a decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions 91 65 93 the underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths although less responsive than those of controls the neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear the overall pattern of results across studies indicates that people diagnosed with psychopathy demonstrate reduced mri fmri amri pet and spect activity in areas of the brain 91 116 93 research has also shown that an approximate 18 smaller amygdala size contributes to a significantly lower emotional sensation in regards to fear sadness amongst other negative emotions which may likely be the reason as to why psychopathic individuals have lower empathy 91 117 93 some recent fmri studies have reported that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions positives and negatives 91 118 93 91 119 93 91 120 93 91 121 93 91 122 93 studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations 91 122 93 91 123 93 91 124 93 91 125 93 91 126 93 91 127 93 meta analyses have also found evidence of impairments in both vocal and facial emotional recognition for several emotions i e not only fear and sadness in both adults and children adolescents 91 127 93 moral judgment edit psychopathy has been associated with amorality an absence of indifference towards or disregard for moral beliefs there are few firm data on patterns of moral judgment studies of developmental level sophistication of moral reasoning found all possible results lower higher or the same as non psychopaths studies that compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of breaking conventional rules or laws found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe whereas non psychopaths rated the rule breaking as less severe 91 128 93 a study comparing judgments of whether personal or impersonal harm would be endorsed in order to achieve the rationally maximum utilitarian amount of welfare found no significant differences between subjects high and low in psychopathy however a further study using the same tests found that prisoners scoring high on the pcl were more likely to endorse impersonal harm or rule violations than non psychopathic controls were the psychopathic offenders who scored low in anxiety were also more willing to endorse personal harm on average 91 128 93 assessing accidents where one person harmed another unintentionally psychopaths judged such actions to be more morally permissible this result has been considered a reflection of psychopaths failure to appreciate the emotional aspect of the victim s harmful experience 91 129 93 cause edit behavioral genetic studies have identified potential genetic and non genetic contributors to psychopathy including influences on brain function proponents of the triarchic model believe that psychopathy results from the interaction of genetic predispositions and an adverse environment what is adverse may differ depending on the underlying predisposition for example it is hypothesized that persons having high boldness may respond poorly to punishment but may respond better to rewards and secure attachments 91 1 93 91 4 93 genetic edit genetically informed studies of the personality characteristics typical of individuals with psychopathy have found moderate genetic as well as non genetic influences on the ppi fearless dominance and impulsive antisociality were similarly influenced by genetic factors and uncorrelated with each other genetic factors may generally influence the development of psychopathy while environmental factors affect the specific expression of the traits that predominate a study on a large group of children found more than 60 heritability for callous unemotional traits and that conduct problems among children with these traits had a higher heritability than among children without these traits 91 4 93 91 113 93 91 130 93 environment edit from accidents such as the one of phineas gage it is known that the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in moral behavior a study by farrington of a sample of london males followed between age 8 and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the pcl sv at age 48 the strongest factors included having a convicted parent being physically neglected low involvement of the father with the boy low family income and coming from a disrupted family other significant factors included poor supervision abuse harsh discipline large family size delinquent sibling young mother depressed mother low social class and poor housing 91 131 93 there has also been association between psychopathy and detrimental treatment by peers 91 2 93 however it is difficult to determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy because of evidence of its strong heritability 91 132 93 brain injury edit researchers have linked head injuries with psychopathy and violence since the 1980s scientists have associated traumatic brain injury such as damage to the prefrontal cortex including the orbitofrontal cortex with psychopathic behavior and a deficient ability to make morally and socially acceptable decisions a condition that has been termed acquired sociopathy or pseudopsychopathy 91 119 93 individuals with damage to the area of the prefrontal cortex known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex show remarkable similarities to diagnosed psychopathic individuals displaying reduced autonomic response to emotional stimuli deficits in aversive conditioning similar preferences in moral and economic decision making and diminished empathy and social emotions like guilt or shame 91 133 93 these emotional and moral impairments may be especially severe when the brain injury occurs at a young age children with early damage in the prefrontal cortex may never fully develop social or moral reasoning and become psychopathic individuals 160 characterized by high levels of aggression and antisocial behavior performed without guilt or empathy for their victims additionally damage to the amygdala may impair the ability of the prefrontal cortex to interpret feedback from the limbic system which could result in uninhibited signals that manifest in violent and aggressive behavior 91 110 93 91 121 93 other theories edit evolutionary explanations edit see also evolutionary psychiatry psychopathy is associated with several adverse life outcomes as well as increased risk of disability and death due to factors such as violence accidents homicides and suicides this in combination with the evidence for genetic influences is evolutionarily puzzling and may suggest that there are compensating evolutionary advantages and researchers within evolutionary psychology have proposed several evolutionary explanations according to one hypothesis some traits associated with psychopathy may be socially adaptive and psychopathy may be a frequency dependent socially parasitic strategy which may work as long as there is a large population of altruistic and trusting individuals relative to the population of psychopathic individuals to be exploited 91 130 93 91 134 93 it is also suggested that some traits associated with psychopathy such as early promiscuous adulterous and coercive sexuality may increase reproductive success 91 130 93 91 134 93 91 135 93 robert hare has stated that many psychopathic males have a pattern of mating with and quickly abandoning women and thereby have a high fertility rate resulting in children that may inherit a predisposition to psychopathy 91 4 93 91 2 93 91 136 93 criticism includes that it may be better to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability furthermore if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of a very large number of adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small effect that it escapes natural selection 91 4 93 91 130 93 the personality is thought to be influenced by a very large number of genes and may be disrupted by random mutations and psychopathy may instead be a product of a high mutation load 91 130 93 psychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel a byproduct or side effect of the evolution of adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself 91 134 93 91 137 93 mechanisms edit psychological edit see also 160 mental characteristics some laboratory research demonstrates correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive stimuli including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment as well as low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs while it has been argued that the reward system functions normally some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli according to the response modulation hypothesis psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so 91 138 93 this may explain the difficulty responding to punishment although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning there may be methodological issues regarding the research 91 4 93 while establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy 91 139 93 neurological edit dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex among other areas is implicated in the mechanism of psychopathy thanks to advancing mri studies experts are able to visualize specific brain differences and abnormalities of individuals with psychopathy in areas that control emotions social interactions ethics morality regret impulsivity and conscience within the brain blair a researcher who pioneered research into psychopathic tendencies stated with regard to psychopathy we have clear indications regarding why the pathology gives rise to the emotional and behavioral disturbance and important insights into the neural systems implicated in this pathology 91 121 93 dadds et al remarks that despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy little is known about the developmental underpinnings of the psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy 91 140 93 a 2008 review by weber et al suggested that psychopathy is sometimes associated with brain abnormalities in prefrontal temporo limbic regions that are involved in emotional and learning processes among others 91 141 93 neuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences between those scoring high and low on the pcl r in a 2011 review by skeem et al stating that they are most notably in the amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyri anterior and posterior cingulate cortex striatum insula and frontal and temporal cortex 91 4 93 91 142 93 the amygdala and frontal areas have been suggested as particularly important 91 111 93 people scoring 25 or higher in the pcl r with an associated history of violent behavior appear on average to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity between the white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex such as the uncinate fasciculus the evidence suggested that the degree of abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors 91 112 93 furthermore changes in the amygdala have been associated with callous unemotional traits in children however the amygdala has also been associated with positive emotions and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas which may be due to methodological issues 91 4 93 some of these findings are consistent with other research and theories for example in a neuroimaging study of how individuals with psychopathy respond to emotional words widespread differences in activation patterns have been shown across the temporal lobe when psychopathic criminals were compared to normal volunteers which is consistent with views in clinical psychology additionally the notion of psychopathy being characterized by low fear is consistent with findings of abnormalities in the amygdala since deficits in aversive conditioning and instrumental learning are thought to result from amygdala dysfunction potentially compounded by orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction although the specific reasons are unknown 91 121 93 91 143 93 considerable research has documented the presence of the two subtypes of primary and secondary psychopathy 91 144 93 91 145 93 proponents of the primary secondary psychopathy distinction and triarchic model argue that there are neurological differences between these subgroups of psychopathy which support their views 91 146 93 for instance the boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued to be associated with reduced activity in the amygdala during fearful or aversive stimuli and reduced startle response while the disinhibition factor is argued to be associated with impairment of frontal lobe tasks there is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable 91 4 93 biochemical edit high levels of testosterone combined with low levels of cortisol and or serotonin have been theorized as contributing factors testosterone is associated with approach related behavior reward sensitivity and fear reduction and injecting testosterone shift s the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity decreases fearfulness and increases responding to angry faces some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance seeking it is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels but a few studies have found that disruption of serotonin neurotransmission disrupts cortisol reactivity to a stress inducing speech task thus dysregulation of serotonin in the brain may contribute to the low cortisol levels observed in psychopathy cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior high testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with impulsive and highly negative reactions and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes frustrated 91 147 93 several animal studies note the role of serotonergic functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior 91 148 93 91 149 93 91 150 93 91 151 93 however some studies on animal and human subjects have suggested that the emotional interpersonal traits and predatory aggression of psychopathy in contrast to impulsive and reactive aggression is related to increased serotoninergic functioning 91 152 93 91 153 93 91 154 93 91 155 93 a study by dolan and anderson regarding the relationship between serotonin and psychopathic traits in a sample of personality disordered offenders found that serotonin functioning as measured by prolactin response while inversely associated with impulsive and antisocial traits were positively correlated with arrogant and deceitful traits and to a lesser extent callous and remorseless traits 91 156 93 bari yildirim theorizes that the 5 httlpr long allele which is generally regarded as protective against internalizing disorders may interact with other serotoninergic genes to create a hyper regulation and dampening of affective processes that results in psychopathy s emotional impairments 91 157 93 furthermore the combination of the 5 httlpr long allele and high testosterone levels has been found to result in a reduced response to threat as measured by cortisol reactivity which mirrors the fear deficits found in those with psychopathy 91 158 93 studies have suggested other correlations psychopathy was associated in two studies with an increased ratio of hva a dopamine metabolite to 5 hiaa a serotonin metabolite 91 147 93 studies have found that individuals with the traits meeting criteria for psychopathy show a greater dopamine response to potential rewards such as monetary promises or taking drugs such as amphetamines this has been theoretically linked to increased impulsivity 91 159 93 a 2010 british study found that a large 2d 4d digit ratio an indication of high prenatal estrogen exposure was a positive correlate of psychopathy in females and a positive correlate of callous affect psychopathy sub scale in males 91 160 93 findings have also shown monoamine oxidase a to affect the predictive ability of the pcl r 91 161 93 monoamine oxidases maos are enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and are therefore capable of influencing feelings mood and behavior in individuals 91 162 93 findings suggest that further research is needed in this area 91 163 93 91 164 93 diagnosis edit tools edit psychopathy checklist edit main article psychopathy checklist psychopathy is most commonly assessed with the psychopathy checklist revised pcl r created by robert d hare based on cleckley s criteria from the 1940s criminological concepts such as those of william and joan mccord and his own research on criminals and incarcerated offenders in canada 91 113 93 91 165 93 91 166 93 the pcl r is widely used and is referred to by some as the gold standard for assessing psychopathy 91 167 93 there are nonetheless numerous criticisms of the pcl r as a theoretical tool and in real world usage 91 168 93 91 169 93 91 170 93 91 171 93 91 self published source 93 91 172 93 psychopathic personality inventory edit main article psychopathic personality inventory unlike the pcl the psychopathic personality inventory ppi was developed to comprehensively index personality traits without explicitly referring to antisocial or criminal behaviors themselves it is a self report scale that was developed originally for non clinical samples e g university students rather than prisoners though may be used with the latter it was revised in 2005 to become the ppi r and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales 91 173 93 the item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors unlike the pcl r factors fearless dominance and impulsive antisociality plus a third factor coldheartedness which is largely dependent on scores on the other two 91 4 93 factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies a person may score at different levels on the different factors but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality 91 4 93 triarchic psychopathy measure edit the triarchic psychopathy measure otherwise known as the tripm is a 58 item self report assessment that measures psychopathy within the three traits identified in the triarchic model boldness meanness and disinhibition each trait is measured on separate subscales and added up resulting in a total psychopathy score 91 174 93 the tripm includes various components of other measures for assessing psychopathy including meanness and disinhibition patterns within the psychopathic personality however there are differing approaches in the measurement of the boldness construct 91 175 93 the boldness construct is used to highlighting the social and interpersonal implications of the psychopathic personality dsm and icd edit there are currently two widely established systems for classifying mental disorders the international classification of diseases icd produced by the world health organization who and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm produced by the american psychiatric association apa both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable although significant differences remain 91 citation needed 93 the first edition of the dsm in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances then a general term that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an antisocial reaction and dyssocial reaction the latter two eventually became antisocial personality disorder aspd in the dsm and dissocial personality disorder in the icd 91 citation needed 93 both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to or include what is referred to as psychopathy or sociopathy although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a disorder officially titled as such 91 4 93 91 7 93 91 10 93 other tools edit there are some traditional personality tests that contain subscales relating to psychopathy though they assess relatively non specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior these include the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory psychopathic deviate scale california psychological inventory socialization scale and millon clinical multiaxial inventory antisocial personality disorder scale there is also the levenson self report psychopathy scale lsrp and the hare self report psychopathy scale hsrp but in terms of self report tests the ppi ppi r has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults 91 4 93 comorbidity edit studies suggest strong comorbidity between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder among numerous studies positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and histrionic narcissistic borderline paranoid and schizoid personality disorders panic and obsessive compulsive disorders but not neurotic disorders in general schizophrenia or depression 91 76 93 91 176 93 91 177 93 91 178 93 91 179 93 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is known to be highly comorbid with conduct disorder a theorized precursor to aspd and may also co occur with psychopathic tendencies this may be explained in part by deficits in executive function 91 176 93 anxiety disorders often co occur with aspd and contrary to assumptions psychopathy can sometimes be marked by anxiety this appears to be related to items from factor 2 but not factor 1 of the pcl r 91 citation needed 93 psychopathy is also associated with substance use disorders 91 78 93 91 176 93 91 178 93 91 180 93 91 181 93 michael fitzgerald suggested overlaps between primary psychopathy and asperger syndrome in terms of fearlessness planning of acts empathy deficits callous behaviour and sometimes superficial charisma 91 182 93 studies investigating similarities and differences between psychopathy and autism indicate that autism and psychopathy are not part of the same construct rather both conditions might co occur in some individuals 91 183 93 recent studies indicate that some individuals with an autism diagnosis also show callous and unemotional traits a risk factor for developing psychopathy 91 184 93 but are less strongly associaed with conduct problems 91 185 93 it has been suggested that psychopathy may be comorbid with several other conditions than these 91 181 93 but limited work on comorbidity has been carried out this may be partly due to difficulties in using inpatient groups from certain institutions to assess comorbidity owing to the likelihood of some bias in sample selection 91 176 93 sex differences edit research on psychopathy has largely been done on men and the pcl r was developed using mainly male criminal samples raising the question of how well the results apply to women men score higher than women on both the pcl r and the ppi and on both of their main scales the differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal affective scale than on the antisocial scale most but not all studies have found broadly similar factor structure for men and women 91 4 93 many associations with other personality traits are similar although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with openness to experience in women it has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an antisocial pattern while in women it manifests more as a histrionic pattern studies on this have shown mixed results pcl r scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women on the other hand psychopathy may have a stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women a suggestion is that psychopathy manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women 91 4 93 furthermore one study has suggested substantial gender differences were found in the etiology of psychopathy for girls 75 of the variance in severe callous and unemotional traits was attributable to environmental factors and just 0 of the variance was attributable to genetic factors in boys the link was reversed 91 186 93 studies have also found that women in prison score significantly lower on psychopathy than men with one study reporting only 11 percent of violent females in prison met the psychopathy criteria in comparison to 31 percent of violent males 91 187 93 other studies have also indicated that high psychopathic females are rare in forensic settings 91 188 93 management edit clinical edit psychopathy has often been considered untreatable its unique characteristics makes it among the most refractory of personality disorders a class of mental illnesses that are already traditionally considered difficult to treat 91 189 93 91 190 93 people with psychopathy are generally unmotivated to seek treatment for their condition and can be uncooperative in therapy 91 167 93 91 189 93 attempts to treat psychopathy with the current tools available to psychiatry have been disappointing harris and rice s handbook of psychopathy says that there is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy as yet no pharmacological therapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional interpersonal and moral deficits of psychopathy and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more adept at the manipulation and deception of others and be more likely to commit crime 91 191 93 some studies suggest that punishment and behavior modification techniques are ineffective at modifying the behavior of psychopathic individuals as they are insensitive to punishment or threat 91 191 93 91 192 93 these failures have led to a widely pessimistic view on its treatment prospects a view that is exacerbated by the little research being done into psychopathy compared to the efforts committed to other mental illnesses which makes it more difficult to gain the understanding of this condition that is necessary to develop effective therapies 91 193 93 91 194 93 although the core character deficits of highly psychopathic individuals are likely to be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings 91 189 93 it has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self interest emphasizing the tangible material value of prosocial behavior with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways 91 195 93 91 196 93 to this end various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy with mixed success 91 189 93 as psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction reward based management in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings 91 197 93 psychiatric medications may also alleviate co occurring conditions sometimes associated with psychopathy or with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity including antipsychotic antidepressant or mood stabilizing medications although none have yet been approved by the fda for this purpose 91 4 93 91 7 93 91 10 93 91 198 93 91 199 93 for example a study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in reducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a sample of high security hospital inpatients with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic traits 91 200 93 however research into the pharmacological treatment of psychopathy and the related condition antisocial personality disorder is minimal with much of the knowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is known about pharmacology in other mental disorders 91 189 93 91 201 93 legal edit the pcl r the pcl sv and the pcl yv are highly regarded and widely used in criminal justice settings particularly in north america they may be used for risk assessment and for assessing treatment potential and be used as part of the decisions regarding bail sentence which prison to use parole and regarding whether a youth should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult there have been several criticisms against its use in legal settings they include the general criticisms against the pcl r the availability of other risk assessment tools which may have advantages and the excessive pessimism surrounding the prognosis and treatment possibilities of those who are diagnosed with psychopathy 91 4 93 the interrater reliability of the pcl r can be high when used carefully in research but tend to be poor in applied settings in particular factor 1 items are somewhat subjective in sexually violent predator cases the pcl r scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in one study the scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters in one study it was estimated that of the pcl r variance about 45 was due to true offender differences 20 was due to which side the rater testified for and 30 was due to other rater differences 91 4 93 to aid a criminal investigation certain interrogation approaches may be used to exploit and leverage the personality traits of suspects thought to have psychopathy and make them more likely to divulge information 91 66 93 united kingdom edit the pcl r score cut off for a label of psychopathy is 25 out of 40 in the united kingdom instead of 30 as it is in the united states 91 4 93 91 6 93 in the united kingdom psychopathic disorder was legally defined in the mental health act uk under mha1983 91 6 93 91 202 93 as a persistent disorder or disability of mind whether or not including significant impairment of intelligence which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned this term was intended to reflect the presence of a personality disorder in terms of conditions for detention under the mental health act 1983 amendments to mha1983 within the mental health act 2007 abolished the term psychopathic disorder with all conditions for detention e g mental illness personality disorder etc encompassed by the generic term of mental disorder 91 67 93 in england and wales the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder is grounds for detention in secure psychiatric hospitals under the mental health act if they have committed serious crimes but since such individuals are disruptive to other patients and not responsive to usual treatment methods this alternative to traditional incarceration is often not used 91 203 93 united states edit sexual psychopath laws edit starting in the 1930s before some modern concepts of psychopathy were developed sexual psychopath laws the term referring broadly to mental illness were introduced by some states and by the mid 1960s more than half of the states had such laws sexual offenses were considered to be caused by underlying mental illnesses and it was thought that sex offenders should be treated in agreement with the general rehabilitative trends at this time courts committed sex offenders to a mental health facility for community protection and treatment 91 68 93 91 204 93 starting in 1970 many of these laws were modified or abolished in favor of more traditional responses such as imprisonment due to criticism of the sexual psychopath concept as lacking scientific evidence the treatment being ineffective and predictions of future offending being dubious there were also a series of cases where persons treated and released committed new sexual offenses starting in the 1990s several states have passed sexually dangerous person laws including registration housing restrictions public notification mandatory reporting by health care professionals and civil commitment which permits indefinite confinement after a sentence has been completed 91 204 93 psychopathy measurements may be used in the confinement decision process 91 4 93 prognosis edit the prognosis for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor with some studies reporting that treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by recidivism rates though it is noted that one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment a 2011 retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s had several serious methodological problems and likely would not be approved of today 91 4 93 91 167 93 however some relatively rigorous quasi experimental studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior regardless of pcl r scores although none were randomized controlled trials various other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse no study has yet examined whether the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be changed by such treatments 91 4 93 91 205 93 frequency edit a 2008 study using the pcl sv found that 1 2 of a us sample scored 13 or more out of 24 indicating potential psychopathy the scores correlated significantly with violence alcohol use and lower intelligence 91 78 93 a 2009 british study by coid et al also using the pcl sv reported a community prevalence of 0 6 scoring 13 or more however if the scoring was adjusted to the recommended 18 or more 91 206 93 this would have left the prevalence closer to 0 1 91 69 93 91 unreliable source 93 the scores correlated with younger age male gender suicide attempts violence imprisonment homelessness drug dependence personality disorders histrionic borderline and antisocial and panic and obsessive compulsive disorders 91 207 93 psychopathy has a much higher prevalence in the convicted and incarcerated population where it is thought that an estimated 15 25 of prisoners qualify for the diagnosis 91 37 93 a study on a sample of inmates in the uk found that 7 7 of the inmates interviewed met the pcl r cut off of 30 for a diagnosis of psychopathy 91 76 93 a study on a sample of inmates in iran using the pcl sv found a prevalence of 23 scoring 18 or more 91 70 93 a study by nathan brooks from bond university found that around one in five corporate bosses display clinically significant psychopathic traits a proportion similar to that among prisoners 91 72 93 society and culture edit in the workplace edit main article psychopathy in the workplace there is limited research on psychopathy in the general work populace in part because the pcl r includes antisocial behavior as a significant core factor obtaining a pcl r score above the threshold is unlikely without having significant scores on the antisocial lifestyle factor and does not include positive adjustment characteristics and most researchers have studied psychopathy in incarcerated criminals a relatively accessible population of research subjects 91 208 93 however psychologists fritzon and board in their study comparing the incidence of personality disorders in business executives against criminals detained in a mental hospital found that the profiles of some senior business managers contained significant elements of personality disorders including those referred to as the emotional components or interpersonal affective traits of psychopathy factors such as boldness disinhibition and meanness as defined in the triarchic model in combination with other advantages such as a favorable upbringing and high intelligence are thought to correlate with stress immunity and stability and may contribute to this particular expression 91 208 93 such individuals are sometimes referred to as successful psychopaths or corporate psychopaths and they may not always have extensive histories of traditional criminal or antisocial behavior characteristic of the traditional conceptualization of psychopathy 91 99 93 robert hare claims that the prevalence of psychopathic traits is higher in the business world than in the general population reporting that while about 1 of the general population meet the clinical criteria for psychopathy figures of around 3 4 have been cited for more senior positions in business 91 4 93 91 209 93 91 210 93 91 page 160 needed 93 hare considers newspaper tycoon robert maxwell to have been a strong candidate as a corporate psychopath 91 44 93 academics on this subject believe that although psychopathy is manifested in only a small percentage of workplace staff it is more common at higher levels of corporate organizations and its negative effects for example increased bullying conflict stress staff turnover absenteeism reduction in productivity often causes a ripple effect throughout an organization setting the tone for an entire corporate culture employees with the disorder are self serving opportunists and may disadvantage their own organizations to further their own interests 91 211 93 91 page 160 needed 93 they may be charming to staff above their level in the workplace hierarchy aiding their ascent through the organization but abusive to staff below their level and can do enormous damage when they are positioned in senior management roles 91 212 93 91 page 160 needed 93 91 213 93 91 page 160 needed 93 psychopathy as measured by the pcl r is associated with lower performance appraisals among corporate professionals 91 214 93 the psychologist oliver james identifies psychopathy as one of the dark triadic traits in the workplace the others being narcissism and machiavellianism which like psychopathy can have negative consequences 91 215 93 91 page 160 needed 93 according to a study from the university of notre dame published in the journal of business ethics psychopaths have a natural advantage in workplaces overrun by abusive supervision and are more likely to thrive under abusive bosses being more resistant to stress including interpersonal abuse and having less of a need for positive relationships than others 91 216 93 91 73 93 91 74 93 in fiction edit main article fictional portrayals of psychopaths characters with psychopathy or sociopathy are some of the most notorious characters in film and literature but their characterizations may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of psychopathy as it is defined in psychiatry criminology and research the character may be identified as having psychopathy within the fictional work itself by its creators or from the opinions of audiences and critics and may be based on undefined popular stereotypes of psychopathy 91 71 93 characters with psychopathic traits have appeared in greek and roman mythology bible stories and some of shakespeare s works 91 32 93 such characters are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically in the role of a villain or antihero where the general characteristics and stereotypes associated with psychopathy are useful to facilitate conflict and danger because the definitions criteria and popular conceptions throughout its history have varied over the years and continue to change even now many of the characters characterized as psychopathic in notable works at the time of publication may no longer fit the current definition and conception of psychopathy there are several archetypal images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits the charming con artist the deranged serial killer and mass murderer the callous and scheming businessperson and the chronic low level offender and juvenile delinquent the public concept reflects some combination of fear of a mythical bogeyman the disgust and intrigue surrounding evil and fascination and sometimes perhaps envy of people who might appear to go through life without attachments and unencumbered by guilt anguish or insecurity 91 4 93 see
