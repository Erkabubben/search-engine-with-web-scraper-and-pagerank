narcissistic personality inventory from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search 1979 research measure of narcissism the narcissistic personality inventory npi was developed in 1979 by raskin and hall and since then has become one of the most widely utilized personality measures for non clinical levels of the trait narcissism 91 1 93 since its initial development the npi has evolved from 220 items to the more commonly employed npi 40 1984 and npi 16 2006 as well as the novel npi 1 inventory 2014 91 2 93 derived from the dsm iii criteria for narcissistic personality disorder npd the npi has been employed heavily by personality and social psychology researchers 91 1 93 the npi is not intended for use in diagnosing narcissistic personality disorder 91 3 93 rather it is often said to measure normal or subclinical borderline narcissism i e in people who score very high on the npi do not necessarily meet all criteria for diagnosis with npd 91 1 93 contents 1 psychometric properties 2 applications 3 criticisms of npi 4 alternatives to npi 5 see also 6 references 7 external links psychometric properties edit the psychometric properties of the npi have been continually investigated since its creation in 1979 both by original creators raskin and hall as well as a variety of researchers to come including emmons bushman amp baumeister and rhodewalt amp morf 91 1 93 according to reliability and validity research conducted by raskin and hall the npi has strong construct validity and ecological validity 91 1 93 when five factor model ffm profiles were created expert rated and meta analytic studies established high correlation to the npi profiles indicating high reliability pertaining to personality trait and behavior correlations 91 1 93 these correlations are supported by research conducted by raskin and hall as well as emmons in which strong positive correlations to extraversion and psychoticism were found 91 1 93 the npi has weak convergent validity and some items have been argued not to reflect the central dogma of narcissism e g i see myself as a good leader 91 1 93 additionally the factor structure of the npi has been questioned in research conducted by emmons four factors were identified through principal components analysis pca including leadership authority self admiration self absorption superiority arrogance and exploitativeness entitlement 91 1 93 on the other hand research conducted by raskin and terry identified seven factors also through pca including authority exhibitionism superiority entitlement exploitativeness self sufficiency and vanity 91 4 93 more recently research by kubarych deary and austin have identified two factors including power and exhibitionism 91 1 93 corry merritt mrug and pamp also identified two factors including leadership authority and exhibitionism entitlement 91 1 93 generally variations in data reduction techniques have been partially attributed to factor structure issues 91 1 93 the npi has also been found to have poor internal consistency 91 1 93 applications edit the npi is used in many organizations as a part of the hiring process it is primarily used in areas where high self serving tendencies positively correlated to narcissism may be a very negative aspect in the job 91 5 93 the npi can not be used solely as a means of rejection but it can be used to expect certain behaviors on the job some organizations pursue narcissism in the individual as a good trait especially for leadership positions or in a group where creativity is considered a good measure 91 5 93 the npi is also considered to be a good test of the dark triad traits the other two traits being machiavellianism and psychopathy 91 citation needed 93 criticisms of npi edit many criticisms of the npi call into question its validity it has been shown that scores on the npi are positively correlated with self esteem with some arguing that the test could be producing false positives for healthy individuals others have argued that this outcome is expected and those expressing narcissistic traits would also express traits indicative of high self esteem 91 6 93 other studies have shown that subjects diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder actually score lower on self esteem measured with the rosenberg self esteem scale than a group of healthy controls revealing more about why the npi is not a valid way to diagnose people with npd 91 3 93 in addition to validity issues the internal consistency of the npi has been brought into question by del rosario and white 91 7 93 in a study examining the test retest reliability and internal consistency of the npi results showed an insufficiency in both test and retest alpha coefficients of the narcissism component scales in comparison to the original raskin and terry 1988 results 91 7 93 alternatives to npi edit other tests have been developed to measure narcissism and its more specific components such as grandiosity and entitlement the pathological narcissism inventory pni narcissistic grandiosity scale ngs and psychological entitlement scale pes are among those tests that have been researched to replace the npi though some don t directly measure narcissism and instead measure a subcategory of narcissism like entitlement elements of the five factor model have also been used to measure narcissism and although these tests show significant correlations with most other scales some researchers suggest that these tests aren t quite ready to replace the npi until more research has been done 91 8 93 the eysenck personality questionnaire s psychoticism and extraversion scales have been shown to have a significant positive correlation with the npi s narcissism measure though the combination of the scales produced much stronger correlations than either of the scales alone these strong positive correlations with other scales show that the npi has good construct validity 91 2 93
