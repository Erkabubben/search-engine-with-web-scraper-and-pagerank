excessive interest in one s physical appearance or image and an excessive preoccupation with one s own needs often at the expense of others 91 1 93 91 2 93 narcissism exists on a continuum that ranges from normal to abnormal personality expression 91 3 93 while there exists normal healthy levels of narcissism in humans there are also more extreme levels of narcissism being seen particularly in people who are self absorbed or people who have a pathological mental illness like narcissistic personality disorder 91 3 93 91 4 93 it is one of the traits featured in the dark triad along with

believed that he could outsmart the gods he was found guilty of hubris and condemned to spend eternity rolling a boulder up a hill each time the boulder would near the summit it would roll back down and sisyphus would then be forced to repeat his task the term narcissism comes from the roman poet ovid s metamorphoses written in the year 8 ad book iii of the poem tells the mythical story of a handsome young man narcissus who spurns the advances of many potential lovers when narcissus rejects the nymph echo who was cursed to only echo the sounds that others made the gods punish narcissus by making him fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water when narcissus discovers that the object of his love cannot love him back he slowly pines away and dies 91 6 93 the concept of excessive selfishness has been recognized throughout history in ancient greece the concept was understood as hubris it wasn t until the late 1800s that narcissism began to be defined in psychological terms 91 7 93 since that time the term narcissism has had a significant divergence in meaning in psychology it has been used to describe a sexual perversion a normal healthy developmental stage a symptom in psychosis and a characteristic in several of the object relations subtypes 91 8 93 paul n cke and havelock ellis 1889 are the first psychiatrists independent of each other to use the term narcissism to describe a person who treats his own body in the same way in which the body of a sexual partner is ordinarily treated narcissism in this context was seen as a perversion that consumed a person s entire sexual life 91 7 93 in 1911 otto rank published the first clinical paper about narcissism linking it to vanity and self admiration 91 9 93 91 7 93 ernest jones 1913 was the first to construe extreme narcissism which he called the god complex as a character flaw he described people with god complex as being aloof self important overconfident auto erotic inaccessible self admiring and exhibitionistic with fantasies of omnipotence and omniscience he observed that these people had a high need for uniqueness 91 10 93 91 11 93 91 12 93 sigmund freud 1914 published his theory of narcissism in a lengthy essay titled on narcissism an introduction freud postulated that all humans have a level of narcissism from birth primary narcissism it is healthy and in time evolves outward as love for others freud had declared that narcissism was a necessary intermediate stage between auto eroticism and object love love for others he also theorized that narcissism becomes a neurosis secondary narcissism when individuals who had reached the point of projecting their affections to others turned their affection back on themselves in time these individuals become cut off from society and uninterested in others 91 13 93 91 14 93 robert waelder 1925 was the first to conceptualize narcissism as a personality trait his definition described individuals who are condescending feel superior to others are preoccupied with admiration and exhibit a lack of empathy 91 15 93 waelder s work and his case study have been influential in the way narcissism and the clinical disorder narcissistic personality disorder are defined today 91 citation needed 93 his patient was a successful scientist with an attitude of superiority an obsession with fostering self respect and a lack of normal feelings of guilt the patient was aloof and independent from others had an inability to empathize with others and was selfish sexually waelder s patient was also overly logical and analytical and valued abstract intellectual thought over the practical application of scientific knowledge 91 16 93 karen horney 1939 postulated that narcissism was on a spectrum that ranged from healthy self esteem to a pathological state 91 15 93 the term entered the broader social consciousness following the publication of the culture of narcissism by christopher lasch in 1979 91 17 93 since then social media bloggers and self help authors have indiscriminately applied narcissism 91 18 93 as a label for the self serving and for all domestic abusers 91 19 93 91 20 93 characteristics freud theorized that narcissism is normal healthy and present from birth in all humans primary narcissism it evolves in time to include affection for others secondary narcissism a neurosis occurs when individuals reverse course and turn their affection back onto themselves narcissism is not necessarily good or bad it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured in certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships and with certain outcome variables such as feeling good about oneself healthy narcissism can be helpful in other contexts such as maintaining long term relationships and with outcome variables such as accurate self knowledge narcissism can be unhelpful 91 21 93 four dimensions of narcissism as a personality variable have been delineated leadership authority superiority arrogance self absorption self admiration and exploitativeness entitlement 91 22 93 normal and healthy levels of narcissism in the history of psychoanalytics a healthy modest amount of narcissism has been viewed as an essential component of mature self esteem and basic self worth 91 23 93 91 24 93 91 25 93 in essence narcissistic behaviors are a system of intrapersonal and interpersonal strategies devoted to protecting one s self esteem 91 22 93 it has been suggested that healthy narcissism is correlated with good psychological health self esteem works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health therefore because of their elevated self esteem deriving from self perceptions of competence and likability high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom 91 26 93 destructive levels of narcissism narcissism in and of itself is a normal personality trait however high levels of narcissistic behavior can be damaging and self defeating 91 27 93 91 unreliable source 93 destructive narcissism is the constant exhibition of a few of the intense characteristics usually associated with pathological narcissistic personality disorder such as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity which is characterized by feelings of entitlement and superiority arrogant or haughty behaviors and a generalized lack of empathy and concern for others 91 2 93 on a spectrum destructive narcissism is more extreme than healthy narcissism but not as extreme as the pathological condition 91 28 93 pathological levels of narcissism main article narcissistic personality disorder extremely high levels of narcissistic behavior are considered pathological 91 citation needed 93 the pathological condition of narcissism is as freud suggested a magnified extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism freud s idea of narcissism described a pathology that manifests itself in the inability to love others a lack of empathy emptiness boredom and an unremitting need to search for power while making the person unavailable to others 91 27 93 the clinical theorists kernberg kohut and theodore millon all saw pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions they suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships 91 29 93 german psychoanalyst karen horney 1885 1952 also saw the narcissistic personality as a temperament trait molded by a certain kind of early environment heritability heritability studies using twins have shown that narcissistic traits as measured by standardized tests are often inherited narcissism was found to have a high heritability score 0 64 indicating that the concordance of this trait in the identical twins was significantly influenced by genetics as compared to an environmental causation it has also been shown that there is a continuum or spectrum of narcissistic traits ranging from normal and a pathological personality 91 30 93 91 31 93 furthermore evidence suggests that individual elements of narcissism have their own heritability score for example intrapersonal grandiosity has a score of 0 23 and interpersonal entitlement has a score of 0 35 91 32 93 while the genetic impact on narcissism levels is significant it isn t the only factor at play expressions of narcissism sexual sexual narcissism has been described as an egocentric pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability or sexual entitlement sometimes in the form of extramarital affairs this can be overcompensation for low self esteem or an inability to sustain true intimacy 91 33 93 while this behavioral pattern is believed to be more common in men than in women 91 34 93 91 35 93 it occurs in both males and females who compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud or obsessed with their masculinity or femininity 91 36 93 the controversial condition referred to as sexual addiction is believed by some experts to be sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity rather than an addictive behavior 91 37 93 parental main article narcissistic parents narcissistic parents often see their children as extensions of themselves and encourage the children to act in ways that support the parents emotional and self esteem needs 91 38 93 due to their vulnerability children may be significantly affected by this behavior 91 39 93 to meet the parents needs the child may sacrifice their own wants and feelings 91 40 93 a child subjected to this type of parenting may struggle in adulthood with their intimate relationships in extreme situations this parenting style can result in estranged relationships with the children coupled with feelings of resentment and in some cases self destructive tendencies 91 38 93 origins of narcissism in children can often come from the social learning theory the social learning theory proposes that social behavior is learned by observing and imitating others behavior this suggests that children are anticipated to grow up to be narcissistic when their parents overvalue them 91 41 93 workplace narcissism main article narcissism in the workplace professionals there is a compulsion of some professionals to constantly assert their competence even when they are wrong 91 42 93 91 43 93 professional narcissism can lead otherwise capable and even exceptional professionals to fall into narcissistic traps most professionals work on cultivating a self that exudes authority control knowledge competence and respectability it s the narcissist in us all we dread appearing stupid or incompetent 91 42 93 executives executives are often provided with potential narcissistic triggers inanimate status symbols like company cars company issued smartphone or prestigious offices with window views and animate flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates 91 44 93 58 8202 143 8202 narcissism has been linked to a range of potential leadership problems ranging from poor motivational skills to risky decision making and in extreme cases white collar crime 91 45 93 high profile corporate leaders that place an extreme emphasis on profits may yield positive short term benefits for their organizations but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies 91 46 93 subordinates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries 91 44 93 58 8202 143 8202 181 8202 studies examining the role of personality in the rise to leadership have shown that individuals who rise to leadership positions can be described as inter personally dominant extroverted and socially skilled 91 45 93 when examining the correlation of narcissism in the rise to leadership positions narcissists who are often inter personally dominant extroverted and socially skilled were also likely to rise to leadership but were more likely to emerge as leaders in situations where they were not known such as in outside hires versus internal promotions paradoxically narcissism can present as characteristics that facilitate an individual s rise to leadership and ultimately lead that person to underachieve or even to fail 91 45 93 general workforce narcissism can create problems in the general workforce for example individuals high in narcissism inventories are more likely to engage in counterproductive behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace 91 47 93 aggressive and counterproductive behaviors tend to surface when self esteem is threatened 91 48 93 91 49 93 individuals high in narcissism have fragile self esteem and are easily threatened one study found that employees who are high in narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low in narcissism 91 50 93 celebrity narcissism celebrity narcissism sometimes referred to as acquired situational narcissism is a form of narcissism that develops in late adolescence or adulthood brought on by wealth fame and the other trappings of celebrity celebrity narcissism develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity obsessed society fans assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency or latent and helping it to become a full blown personality disorder robert millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people 91 51 93 in its most extreme presentation and symptoms it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder differing only in its late onset and its environmental support by large numbers of fans the lack of social norms controls and of people centering them makes these people believe they re invulnerable 91 51 93 so that the person may suffer from unstable relationships substance abuse or erratic behaviors collective narcissism main article collective narcissism collective narcissism is a type of narcissism where an individual has an inflated self love of their own group 91 52 93 while the classic definition of narcissism focuses on the individual collective narcissism asserts that one can have a similar excessively high opinion of a group and that a group can function as a narcissistic entity 91 52 93 collective narcissism is related to ethnocentrism however ethnocentrism primarily focuses on self centeredness at an ethnic or cultural level while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup beyond just cultures and ethnicities 91 52 93 91 53 93 normalization of narcissistic behaviors studies have shown that individuals who score high on narcissism scales self sufficiency vanity leadership and admiration demand posted selfies to social media sites more than individuals who exhibit low narcissism scores men posting selfies had higher narcissism scores than women 91 54 93 some commentators contend that the american populace has become increasingly narcissistic since the end of world war ii 91 55 93 91 56 93 91 57 93 people compete mightily for attention in social situations they tend to steer the conversation away from others and toward themselves the profusion of popular literature about listening and managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life 91 58 93 this claim is substantiated by the growth of reality tv programs 91 55 93 the growth of an online culture in which digital media social media and the desire for fame are generating a new era of public narcissism 91 59 93 also supporting the contention that american culture has become more narcissistic is an analysis of us popular song lyrics between 1987 and 2007 this found a growth in the use of first person singular pronouns reflecting a greater focus on the self and also of references to antisocial behavior during the same period there was a diminution of words reflecting a focus on others positive emotions and social interactions 91 31 93 91 60 93 references to narcissism and self esteem in american popular print media have experienced vast inflation since the late 1980s 91 60 93 between 1987 and 2007 direct mentions of self esteem in leading us newspapers and magazines increased by 4 540 per cent while narcissism which had been almost non existent in the press during the 1970s was referred to over 5 000 times between 2002 and 2007 91 60 93 individualistic vs collectivist national cultures similar patterns of change in cultural production are observable in other western states for example a linguistic analysis of the largest circulation norwegian newspaper found that the use of self focused and individualistic terms increased in frequency by 69 per cent between 1984 and 2005 while collectivist terms declined by 32 per cent 91 61 93 one study looked at differences in advertising between an individualistic culture united states and a collectivist culture south korea and found that in the us there was a greater tendency to stress the distinctiveness and uniqueness of the person where as advertising in south korean stressed the importance of social conformity and harmony 91 61 93 these cultural differences were greater than the effects of individual differences within national cultures 91 61 93 controversies there has been an increased interest in narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder npd in the last 10 years 91 62 93 there are areas of substantial debate that surround the subject including clearly defining the difference between normal and pathological narcissism 91 62 93 understanding the role of self esteem in narcissism 91 62 93 reaching a consensus on the classifications and definitions of sub types such as grandiose and vulnerable dimensions or variants of these 91 62 93 understanding what are the central versus peripheral primary versus secondary features characteristics of narcissism determining if there is consensual description 91 62 93 agreeing on the etiological factors 91 62 93 deciding what field or discipline narcissism should be studied by 91 62 93 agreeing on how it should be assessed and measured 91 62 93 and agreeing on its representation in textbooks and classification manuals 91 62 93 this extent of the controversy was on public display in 2010 2013 when the committee on personality disorders for the 5th edition 2013 of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders recommended the removal of narcissistic personality from the manual a contentious three year debate unfolded in the clinical community with one of the sharpest critics being professor john gunderson md the person who led the dsm personality disorders committee for the 4th edition of the
