grandiosity from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search unrealistic sense of superiority and of uniqueness not to be confused with grandiose delusion or illusory superiority in the field of psychology the term grandiosity refers to an unrealistic sense of superiority characterized by a sustained view of one s self as better than others which is expressed by disdainfully criticising them contempt overinflating one s own capability and belittling them as inferior and refers to a sense of personal uniqueness the belief that few other people have anything in common with oneself and that one can only be understood by a few very special people 91 1 93 the personality trait of grandiosity is principally associated with narcissistic personality disorder npd but also is a feature in the occurrence and expression of antisocial personality disorder and the manic and hypomanic episodes of bipolar disorder 91 2 93 contents 1 narcissist grandiose oblivious subtype 2 in mania 3 in psychopathy 4 reality testing 5 psychoanalysis and the grandiose self 6 reactive attachment disorder 7 see also 8 references narcissist grandiose oblivious subtype edit pathological grandiosity has been associated with one of the two subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder gabbard 1989 91 3 93 characteristics of the narcissist grandiose subtype as opposed to the narcissist vulnerable subtype include being labeled the oblivious narcissists as they are oblivious to the impact of their actions on others or how they are perceived by others devaluation and criticism of people that threaten self esteem more likely to regulate self esteem through overt self enhancement over claiming abilities or exaggerating situations to project superiority denial of weaknesses exaggeration of abilities controlling others whilst both belittling criticizing and taking credit for their actions inflated demands of entitlement superiority don t you know who i am exaggerated beliefs of self importance superiority achievement and ability manipulative behaviors as well as expectations of obedience admiration and entitlement and preoccupation with fantasies about success power brilliance beauty or the perfect mate consistent anger when confronted with unmet expectations or any perceived slight or accountability for actions prone to easily exploding into rage overreacting and possibly even becoming aggressive whenever they feel attacked by even the slightest criticism blame shifts when accountable diminished awareness of the cultural dissonance between their expectations and reality along with the impact this has on relationships overt presentation of grandiose fantasies wealth success and status oblivious that expectations of entitlement overspending taking advantage may make a poor impression on other people conflict within the environment is generally experienced as external to these individuals i e not their fault rather than as a measure of their own unrealistic expectations the differences between grandiose and vulnerable narcissist subtypes have been studied dickinson amp pincus 2003 91 4 93 this overall finding confirms past theory and research that suggests that these grandiose subtype individuals lack knowledge of the impact they have upon others and thus have an unrealistic view of themselves in relation to others gabbard 1989 1998 kernberg 1975 kohut 1971 1977 indeed this very lack of insight into their impact upon others is what incited gabbard 1989 to enlist the label oblivious narcissists to describe their social presentation and distinguish them from their vulnerable counterparts grandiose narcissistic individuals expect another s immediate and undivided attention and are oblivious to the effect their direct demands of entitlement have on others and by virtue of their ability to maintain the grandiose self through self enhancement grandiose narcissistic individuals are less susceptible than their vulnerable peers to the chronic emotional consequences of threats to entitled expectations e g distress lowered self esteem interpersonal fearfulness the grandiosity section of the diagnostic

back down to size 91 8 93 in psychopathy edit grandiosity features in factor 1 facet 1 interpersonal in the hare psychopathy checklist revised pcl r test 91 9 93 individuals endorsing this criterion appear arrogant and boastful and may be unrealistically optimistic about their future the american psychiatric association s dsm 5 also notes that persons with antisocial personality disorder often display an inflated self image and can appear excessively self important opinionated and cocky and often hold others in contempt reality testing edit a distinction is made between individuals exhibiting grandiosity which includes a degree of insight into their unrealistic thoughts they are aware that their behavior is considered unusual and those experiencing grandiose delusions who lack this capability for reality testing some individuals may transition between these two states with grandiose ideas initially developing as daydreams that the patient recognises as untrue but which can subsequently turn into full delusions that the patient becomes convinced reflect reality 91 10 93 psychoanalysis and the grandiose self edit otto kernberg saw the unhealthily grandiose self as merging childhood feelings of specialness personal ideals and fantasies of an ideal parent 91 11 93 heinz kohut saw the grandiose self as a normal part of the developmental process only pathological when the grand and humble parts of the self became decisively divided 91 12 93 kohut s recommendations for dealing with the patient with a disordered grandiose self were to tolerate and so re integrate the grandiosity with the realistic self 91 13 93 reactive attachment disorder edit the personality trait of grandiosity also is a component of the reactive attachment disorder rad a severe and relatively uncommon attachment disorder that affects children 91 14 93 the expression of rad is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating to other people in most
