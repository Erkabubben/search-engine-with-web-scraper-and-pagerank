disinhibited instinctual drives including risk taking behaviours and hypersexuality disinhibition is a common symptom following brain injury or lesions particularly to the frontal lobe and primarily to the orbitofrontal cortex 91 2 93 the neuropsychiatric sequelae following brain injuries could include diffuse cognitive impairment with more prominent deficits in the rate of information processing attention memory cognitive flexibility and problem solving prominent impulsivity affective instability and disinhibition are seen frequently secondary to injury to frontal temporal and limbic areas in association with the typical cognitive deficits these sequelae characterise the frequently noted personality changes in tbi traumatic brain injury patients disinhibition syndromes in brain injuries and insults including brain tumors strokes and epilepsy range from mildly inappropriate social behaviour lack of control over one s behaviour to the full blown mania depending on the lesions to specific brain regions several studies in brain traumas and insults have demonstrated significant associations between disinhibition syndromes and dysfunction of orbitofrontal and basotemporal cortices affecting visuospatial functions somatosensation and spatial memory motoric instinctive affective and intellectual behaviours 91 2 93 disinhibition syndromes have also been reported with mania like manifestations in old age with lesions to the orbito frontal and basotemporal cortex involving limbic and frontal connections orbitofrontal circuit especially in the right hemisphere 91 3 93 behavioural disinhibition as a result of damage to frontal lobe could be seen as a result of consumption of alcohol and central nervous system depressants drugs e g benzodiazepines that disinhibit the frontal cortex from self regulation and control 91 4 93 91 5 93 it has also been argued that adhd hyperactive impulsive subtype have a general behavioural disinhibition beyond impulsivity and many morbidities or complications of adhd e g conduct disorder anti social personality disorder substance abuse and risk taking behaviours are all consequences of untreated behavioural disinhibition 91 6

speaking when the behavior occurs assertively in a nonjudgmental clear unambiguous way provide feedback that the behavior is inappropriate and say what you prefer instead for example jane you re standing too close when you are speaking to me i feel uncomfortable please take a step back or i don t like it when you say i look hot in front of your wife i feel uncomfortable i am your attendant carer support worker i am here to help you with your shopping also in non verbal communication communication can appear in other forms one could say i don t like it when you dart your eyes at me in that way then re direct to the next activity any subsequent behavior ignore then generally as almost all behavior is communication understand what the behavior is trying to communicate and look at
