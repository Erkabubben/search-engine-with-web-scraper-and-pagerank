projects working groups and via collaborations 91 43 93 positions on sexual orientation edit cause of sexual orientation edit further information biology and sexual orientation environment and sexual orientation and homosexuality and psychology the apa states the following there is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual bisexual or homosexual orientation although much research has examined the possible genetic hormonal developmental social and cultural influences on sexual orientation no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation 91 44 93 in 1975 apa issued a supporting statement that homosexuality is not a mental disorder 91 45 93 91 46 93 conversion therapy edit further information conversion therapy conversion therapy also referred to as reparative therapy is the practice of attempting to change the patient s sexual orientation to heterosexual among the most prominent supporters of conversion therapy is the national association for research amp therapy of homosexuality narth which continues to characterize homosexuality as a mental disorder despite the declassification of homosexuality as a disorder in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm in 1973 91 47 93 one of the most notable members of narth is founder and former president dr joseph nicolosi who practiced conversion therapy and has published case studies of some of his clients 91 48 93 the american psychological association apa task force report on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation concluded that conversion therapy was unlikely to be successful and involved some risk of harm 91 47 93 likewise the u s surgeon general issued a call to action in 2001 concluding that there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed 91 49 93 in the task force s report the apa recommends that therapists adopt an affirmative supportive approach for clients who present for therapy to change their sexual orientation rather than attempting to convert their sexual orientation 91 47 93 there is a concern in the mental health community that the advancement of conversion therapy itself causes social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation and the ability of homosexual and bisexual people to lead happy healthy lives 91 50 93 most mainstream health organizations are critical of conversion therapy and no mainstream medical organization endorses conversion therapy 91 50 93 91 51 93 91 52 93 91 53 93 91 note 1 93 the apa adopted a resolution in august 2009 stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments the approval by apa s governing council of representatives came at apa s annual convention during which a task force presented a report 91 54 93 that in part examined the efficacy of so called reparative therapy or sexual orientation change efforts the resolution on appropriate affirmative responses to sexual orientation distress and change efforts also advises that parents guardians young people and their families avoid sexual orientation treatments that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and instead seek psychotherapy social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality increase family and school support and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth 91 55 93 same sex marriage edit further information same sex marriage the apa adopted a resolution stating that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant rights benefits and privileges it also filed an amicus brief in the federal court case in which judge vaughn walker struck down california s constitutional ban on same sex marriage 91 56 93 the apa later praised the decision and denied the existence of any scientific justification for a ban on same sex marriage 91 57 93 in august 2011 the apa clarified their support of same sex marriage in light of continued research suggesting that the same community benefits accepted as result of heterosexual marriage apply to same sex couples as well dr clinton anderson then associate executive director of the apa and director of the office on lesbian gay bisexual and transgender concerns said that prior to this research we knew that marriage benefits heterosexual people in very significant ways but we didn t know if that would be true for same sex couples anderson also put forward the apa s view that merely allowing same sex civil unions is an inadequate option anything other than marriage is in essence a stigmatization of same sex couples stigma does have negative impacts on people 91 58 93 apa internship crisis for graduate students edit the apa is the main accrediting body for u s clinical and counseling psychology doctoral training programs and internship sites 91 59 93 apa accredited clinical psychology phd and psyd programs typically require students to complete a one year full time clinical internship in order to graduate or a two year part time internship however there is currently an internship crisis as defined by the american psychological association in that approximately 25 of clinical psychology doctoral students do not match for internship each year 91 60 93 91 61 93 this crisis has led many students approximately 1 000 each year to re apply for internship thus delaying graduation or to complete an unaccredited internship and often has many emotional and financial consequences 91 62 93 students who do not complete an apa accredited internship in the u s are barred from certain employment settings including va hospitals the military and cannot get licensed in some states such as utah and mississippi 91 63 93 91 64 93 additionally some postdoctoral fellowships and other employment settings require or prefer an apa accredited internship 91 63 93 the apa has been criticized for not addressing this crisis adequately and many psychologists and graduate students have petitioned for the apa to take action by regulating graduate training programs warfare and the use of torture edit a year after the establishment of the human resources research organization by the u s military in 1951 the cia began funding numerous psychologists and other scientists in the development of psychological warfare methods under the supervision of apa treasurer meredith crawford donald o hebb the apa president in 1960 who was awarded the apa distinguished scientific contribution award in 1961 defended the torture of research subjects arguing that what was being studied was other nations methods of brainwashing former apa president martin seligman spoke upon the invitation of the cia on his animal experimentation where he shocked a dog unpredictably and repeatedly into total helpless passivity former apa president ronald f levant upon visiting guantanamo bay affirmed that psychologists were present during the torture of prisoners arguing that their presence was to add value and safeguards to interrogations 91 65 93 former apa president gerald koocher argued referring to allegations of continuing systemic abuse by psychologists that such allegations were originating from opportunistic commentators masquerading as scholars 91 66 93 during the iraq war amnesty international released a series of reports calling attention to violations of the human rights of prisoners in abu ghraib prison and american detention camps and the role of the united states and the united kingdom in enacting these abuses 91 67 93 91 68 93 91 69 93 the reports called on the occupying powers to protect the human rights of any detained civilians by giving them a fair and timely trial not detaining civilians arbitrarily and treating all people ethically while in detention amnesty international also called for justice by trying individual perpetrators of abuse for their crimes 91 69 93 despite these reports the bush administration instituted enhanced interrogation techniques stating publicly that reported abuses were isolated incidents and not standard practice internal memos from the federal bureau of investigation revealed that an executive order by george w bush had sanctioned certain interrogation techniques such as playing loud music depriving prisoners of sleep and stripping prisoners of their clothing 91 70 93 the cia reportedly required involvement from health professionals to continue its practice of enhanced interrogations on detainees to maintain the lawfulness of their practices psychiatrists and medical doctors were reluctant to participate in interrogations however some psychologists participated 91 71 93 a report by a group of psychologists alleges the same implicating a number of apa officials as well 91 72 93 when it emerged that psychologists as part of the behavioral science consultation team were advising interrogators in guant namo and other u s facilities on improving the effectiveness of the enhanced interrogation techniques the apa called on the u s government to prohibit the use of unethical interrogation techniques and labeled specific techniques as torture 91 73 93 critics pointed out that the apa declined to advise its members not to participate in such interrogations 91 74 93 91 75 93 in september 2008 the apa s members passed a resolution stating that psychologists may not work in settings where persons are held outside or in violation of either international law e g the un convention against torture and the geneva conventions or the u s constitution where appropriate unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights 91 76 93 the resolution became official apa policy in february 2009 however the apa has refused to sanction those members known to have participated in and in some cases designed abusive interrogation techniques used in guantanamo bay iraq and afghanistan interrogation centers 91 77 93 91 78 93 the apa directive was in contrast to the american psychiatric association ban in may 2006 of all direct participation in interrogations by psychiatrists 91 79 93 and the american medical association ban in june 2006 of the direct participation in interrogations by physicians 91 80 93 an independent panel of medical military ethics education public health and legal professionals issued a comprehensive report in november 2013 that charged that u s military and intelligence agencies directed doctors and psychologists working in u s military detention centers to violate standard ethical principles and medical standards to avoid infliction of harm 91 81 93 one group of psychologists in particular the coalition for an ethical psychology has been very harsh in its criticism of the apa stance on its refusal to categorically prohibit members from participating in any phase of military interrogations they recently stated their continuing disagreement with apa leadership in an open letter posted on their website on october 31 2012 in which they reiterated their condemnation of torture and enhanced interrogation techniques and called for the apa to require its members to refuse participation in military conducted interrogations of any kind 91 82 93 after the abuses were made public the apa created a task force called psychological ethics and national security pens and released a report stating that the apa code of ethics applies to psychologists working in any setting and that psychologists do not facilitate or participate in any degrading or cruel behavior referring back to the apa s 1986 resolution against torture the report also called on psychologists to report any suspected or observed inhumane treatment to the appropriate authorities and obey federal law 91 83 93 amending the ethics code edit in february 2010 the apa s council of representatives voted to amend the association s ethics code 91 84 93 to make clear that its standards can never be interpreted to justify or defend violating human rights there is a history of similar issues with the canadian psychological association following are the two relevant ethical standards from the apa ethics code with the newly adopted language shown in bold 1 02 conflicts between ethics and law regulations or other governing legal authorityif psychologists ethical responsibilities conflict with law regulations or other governing legal authority psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict make known their commitment to the ethics code and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the general principles and ethical standards of the ethics code under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights 1 03 conflicts between ethics and organizational demandsif the demands of an organization with which psychologists are affiliated or for whom they are working are in conflict with this ethics code psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict make known their commitment to the ethics code and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the general principles and ethical standards of the ethics code under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights 91 85 93 in its 2013 policy related to psychologists work in national security settings and reaffirmation of the apa position against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the apa condemns the use of any of the following practices by military interrogators trying to elicit anti terrorism information from detainees on the ground that there are no exceptional circumstances whatsoever whether induced by a state of war or threat of war internal political instability or any other public emergency that may be invoked as a justification 91 76 93 hoffman report edit in november 2014 the apa ordered an independent review into whether it cooperated with the government s use of torture of prisoners during the george w bush administration naming chicago attorney david h hoffman to conduct the review 91 86 93 on july 2 2015 a 542 page report was issued to the special committee of the board of directors of the apa relating to ethics guidelines national security interrogations and torture 91 87 93 the report concluded that the apa secretly collaborated with the bush administration to bolster a legal and ethical justification for the torture of prisoners 91 88 93 furthermore the report stated that the association s ethics director stephen behnke and others had colluded with important department of defense officials to have the apa issue loose high level ethical guidelines that did not constrain the interrogation of terrorism suspects at guantanamo bay the association s principal motive in doing so was to align apa and curry favor with dod 91 89 93 an apa official said that ethics director stephen behnke had been removed from his position as a result of the report and indicated that other firings or sanctions might follow 91 89 93 ultimately the findings of the hoffman report revealed that the apa had an unfair bias towards prisoners due to the organization s relationship with the federal government this resulted in a tidal wave of consequences for the apa on july 14 2015 the apa announced the retirement of its ceo norman b anderson effective the end of 2015 and of deputy chief executive officer michael honaker effective august 15 2015 and the resignation of rhea k farberman apa s executive director for public and member communication anderson had been ceo since 2003 91 90 93 91 91 93 ban on involvement edit for at least a decade dissident psychologists within and outside the apa including the group withholdapadues 91 92 93 had protested the involvement of psychologists in interrogations at cia black sites and guant namo prior to the release of the hoffman report which undermined the apa s repeated denials and showed that some apa leaders were complicit in torture the dissidents were ignored or ridiculed 91 93 93 91 94 93 on august 7 2015 just weeks following the release of the hoffman report the apa council of representatives met at the association s 123rd annual convention in toronto ontario at that meeting the apa council passed resolution 23b which implemented the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from settings that operate outside international law and banning the participation of psychologists in unlawful interrogations with 156 votes in favor and only one vote against the resolution passed with the near unanimous approval of council members 91 95 93 the adoption of resolution 23b aligned the apa s policy with that of the american psychiatric association and that of the american medical association by prohibiting psychologists from participating in interrogations deemed illegal by the geneva conventions and the united nations convention against torture 91 94 93 implementation of the 2008 membership vote to remove psychologists from all settings that operate outside of international law nbi 23b council is asked to approve the substitute main motion below that includes a revised resolution with a new title resolution to amend the 2006 and 2013 council resolutions to clarify the roles of psychologists related to interrogation and detainee welfare in national security settings to further implement the 2008 petition resolution and to safeguard against acts of torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in all settings this resolution further aligns the apa policy definition for cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the 2006 and 2013 council resolutions with the united nations un convention against torture and ensures that the definition applies broadly to all individuals and settings offers apa as a supportive resource for ethical practice for psychologists including those in military and national security roles prohibits psychologists from participating in national security interrogations clarifies the intended application of the 2008 petition resolution and calls for apa letters to be sent to federal officials to inform them of these policy changes and clarifications of existing apa policy 91 96 93 the ban will not prohibit psychologists from working with the police or prisons in criminal law enforcement interrogations 91 95 93 class action lawsuit by members claiming deceptive dues assessments edit in 2013 a class action lawsuit was brought against apa on behalf of approximately 60 000 of its 122 000 members who were licensed clinicians those members paid an additional 140 practice assessment fee as part of their membership dues every year beginning in 2001 to fund the lobbying arm of apa the apa practice organization apapo the lawsuit accused apa of using deceptive means by representing that the assessment was mandatory for apa membership even though payment of the assessment was only required for membership in the apapo in 2015 apa settled the case by establishing a 9 02 million settlement fund to be used to pay claims made by members of apa who paid the practice assessment as well as attorneys fees and certain other costs apa agreed to change its policies to make clear that the apapo membership dues are not required for membership in apa 91 97 93 91 98 93 91 99 93 91 100 93 91 101 93 animal research edit currently the apa enforces ethical standards to protect nonhuman animal subjects from unnecessary harm during the research process some of the requirements for using nonhuman animals in research include proper justification of the research maintenance and inspection of appropriate housing for the animals minimizing discomfort and stress whenever possible and preference of noninvasive measures 91 102 93 despite these guidelines however many advocacy groups exist to either reduce or eliminate animal research arguing that it is unethical to capture animals and subject them to research procedures 91 103 93 91 104 93 91 105 93 evidence based practice edit a current controversy among mental health professionals involves the use of the terms evidence based practice or evidence based treatment proponents of the evidence based treatments movement argue that it is unethical to administer a therapeutic intervention with questionable research support when another treatment s effectiveness has been demonstrated for the client s condition particularly when the intervention in question is potentially harmful such as conversion therapy proponents argue that administration of an empirically questionable treatment violates the general principle a of the ethical principles of psychologist beneficence and nonmaleficence or do no harm 91 106 93 critics of the evidence based practice movement note ethical concerns regarding the research and practice of evidenced based treatments themselves despite the demonstrated effectiveness of a range of treatments including psychoanalytic and psychodynamic therapies 91 107 93 evidence based practice is a term now associated only with short term manualized treatments which have been evaluated in randomized control trials among the problems associated with an exclusive focus on randomized control trials to determine treatment effectiveness is that the relevance of these trials conducted on highly selected patient populations is unclear for psychologists working with real world patients 91 108 93 furthermore while the public may assume evidence based is synonymous for likely to help research studies indicate that most patients do not show meaningful improvement in so called evidence based treatments 91 109 93 see
