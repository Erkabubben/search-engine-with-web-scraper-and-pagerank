or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference that is the capacity to place oneself in another s position 91 1 93 definitions of empathy encompass a broad range of social cognitive and emotional processes primarily concerned with understanding others and others emotions in particular types of empathy include cognitive empathy emotional or affective empathy

empatheia meaning physical affection or passion 91 5 93 that word derives from en in at and pathos passion or suffering 91 6 93 theodor lipps adapted the german aesthetic term einf hlung feeling into to psychology in 1903 91 7 93 and edward b titchener translated einf hlung into english as empathy in 1909 91 8 93 in modern greek may mean depending on context prejudice malevolence malice or hatred 91 9 93 definitions edit general edit since its introduction into the english language empathy has had a wide range of sometimes conflicting definitions among both researchers and laypeople 91 10 93 91 11 93 91 12 93 empathy definitions encompass a broad range of phenomena including caring for other people and having a desire to help them experiencing emotions that match another person s emotions discerning what another person is thinking or feeling 91 13 93 and making less distinct the differences 91 clarification needed 93 between the self and the other 91 14 93 since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people the way it is characterized derives from the way emotions are characterized for example if emotions are characterized by bodily feelings then understanding the bodily feelings of another will be considered central to empathy on the other hand if emotions are characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires then understanding those beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy the ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated process however the basic capacity to recognize emotions in others may be innate 91 15 93 and may be achieved unconsciously empirical research supports a variety of interventions to improve empathy 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 empathy is not all or nothing rather a person can be more or less empathic toward another paradigmatically a person exhibits empathy when they communicate an accurate recognition of the significance of another person s ongoing intentional actions associated emotional states and personal characteristics in a manner that seems accurate and tolerable to the recognized person 91 21 93 91 22 93 one s ability to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one s imitative capacities and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the proprioceptive feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself 91 23 93 distinctions between empathy and related concepts edit compassion and sympathy are terms associated with empathy a person feels compassion when they notice others are in need and this feeling motivates that person to help like empathy compassion has a wide range of definitions and purported facets which overlap with some definitions of empathy 91 24 93 91 25 93 sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need some include in sympathy an empathic concern for another person and the wish to see them better off or happier 91 26 93 empathy is also related to pity and emotional contagion 91 27 93 91 26 93 one feels pity towards others who might be in trouble or in need of help this feeling is described as feeling sorry for someone emotional contagion is when a person especially an infant or a member of a mob imitatively catches the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening 91 28 93 alexithymia describes a deficiency in understanding processing or describing one s own emotions unlike empathy which is about someone else s emotions 91 29 93 classification edit empathy has two major components 91 30 93 affective empathy also called emotional empathy 91 31 93 is the ability to respond with an appropriate emotion to another s mental states 91 30 93 our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion 91 31 93 being affected by another s emotional or arousal state 91 32 93 affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales 91 30 93 91 33 93 empathic concern sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering 91 30 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 personal distress feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another s suffering 91 30 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 there is no consensus regarding whether personal distress is a form of empathy or instead is something distinct from empathy 91 27 93 91 34 93 there may be a developmental aspect to this subdivision infants respond to the distress of others by getting distressed themselves only when they are two years old do they start to respond in other oriented ways trying to help comfort and share 91 34 93 cognitive empathy is the ability to understand another s perspective or mental state 91 36 93 91 30 93 91 37 93 the terms empathic accuracy social cognition perspective taking theory of mind and mentalizing are often used synonymously but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy it is unclear whether these are equivalent 91 38 93 although measures of cognitive empathy include self report questionnaires and behavioral measures a 2019 meta analysis 91 39 93 found only a negligible association between self report and behavioral measures suggesting that people are generally not able to accurately assess their own cognitive empathy abilities cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales 91 30 93 91 33 93 perspective taking the tendency to spontaneously adopt others psychological perspectives 91 30 93 91 40 93 fantasy the tendency to identify with fictional characters 91 30 93 tactical or strategic empathy the deliberate use of perspective taking to achieve certain desired ends 91 41 93 the scientific community has not coalesced around a precise definition of these constructs but there is consensus about this distinction 91 42 93 91 43 93 91 44 93 affective and cognitive empathy are also independent from one another someone who strongly empathizes emotionally is not necessarily good in understanding another s perspective 91 45 93 development edit evolution across species edit studies in animal behavior and neuroscience indicate that empathy is not restricted to humans however the interpretation of such research depends in part on how expansive a definition of empathy researchers adopt 91 27 93 empathy like behaviors have been observed in primates both in captivity and in the wild and in particular in bonobos perhaps the most empathic primate 91 46 93 one study demonstrated prosocial behavior elicited by empathy in rodents 91 47 93 rodents demonstrate empathy for cagemates but not strangers in pain 91 48 93 an influential study on the evolution of empathy by stephanie preston and frans de waal 91 49 93 discusses a neural perception action mechanism and postulates a bottom up model of empathy that ties together all levels 91 clarification needed 93 from state matching 91 clarification needed 93 to perspective taking university of chicago neurobiologist jean decety agrees that empathy is not exclusive to humans but that empathy has deep evolutionary biochemical and neurological underpinnings and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication social attachment and parental care 91 50 93 neural circuits involved in empathy and caring include the brainstem the amygdala hypothalamus basal ganglia insula and orbitofrontal cortex 91 51 93 ontogenetic development edit by the age of two children normally begin to exhibit fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person s emotional state 91 52 93 even earlier at one year of age infants have some rudiments of empathy they understand that as with their own actions other people s actions have goals 91 53 93 91 54 93 toddlers sometimes comfort others or show concern for them during their second year they play games of falsehood or pretend in an effort to fool others such actions require that the child knows what others believe in order that the child can manipulate those beliefs 91 55 93 according to researchers at the university of chicago who used functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri children between the ages of seven and twelve experience brain activity when seeing others be injured similar to the brain activity that would occur if the child themself had been injured 91 56 93 their findings are consistent with previous fmri studies of pain empathy with adults and previous findings that vicarious experiencing particularly of others distress is hardwired and present early in life 91 56 93 the research found additional areas of the brain associated with social and moral cognition were activated when young people saw another person intentionally hurt by somebody including regions involved in moral reasoning 91 56 93 although children are capable of showing some signs of empathy including attempting to comfort a crying baby from as early as 18 months to two years most do not demonstrate a full theory of mind until around the age of four 91 57 93 theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one s own and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy 91 36 93 children usually can pass false belief tasks a test for a theory of mind around the age of four it is theorised that people with autism find using a theory of mind to be very difficult e g the sally anne test 91 58 93 91 59 93 empathic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the yale university school of nursing it addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients the theory first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions postulates three levels of cognitive structures the third and highest level is a meta ethical theory of the moral structure of care adults who operate with level iii understanding synthesize systems of justice and care based ethics 91 60 93 individual differences edit the empathic concern scale assesses other oriented feelings of sympathy and concern and the personal distress scale measures self oriented feelings of personal anxiety and unease 91 61 93 researchers have used behavioral and neuroimaging data to analyze extraversion and agreeableness the warmth altruistic personality profile both are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions that are important for empathic processing medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction 91 62 93 sex differences edit part of a series onsex differences in humans biology sexual differentiation disorders in

gender inequality leadership religion social capital vte see also sex differences in psychology 160 empathy and sex differences in emotional intelligence 160 empathy on average females score higher than males on measures of empathy 91 63 93 such as the empathy quotient eq while males tend to score higher on the systemizing quotient sq both males and females with autistic spectrum disorders usually score lower on the eq and higher on sq see below for more detail on autism and empathy 91 36 93 other studies show no significant sex differences and instead suggest that gender differences are the result of motivational differences such as upholding stereotypes 91 63 93 91 64 93 gender stereotypes about men and women can affect how they express emotions the sex difference is small to moderate somewhat inconsistent and is often influenced by the person s motivations or social environment 91 63 93 bosson et al say physiological measures of emotion and studies that track people in their daily lives find no consistent sex differences in the experience of emotion which suggests that women may amplify certain emotional expressions or men may suppress them 91 63 93 however a 2014 review from neuroscience amp biobehavioral reviews reported that there is evidence that sex differences in empathy have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots in biology and are not merely cultural byproducts driven by socialization 91 65 93 a review published in neuropsychologia found that females tended to be better at recognizing facial effects expression processing and emotions in general 91 66 93 males tended to be better at recognizing specific behaviors such as anger aggression and threatening cues 91 66 93 a 2014 meta analysis in cognition and emotion found a small female advantage in non verbal emotional recognition 91 67 93 the 2014 neuroscience amp biobehavioral reviews analysis found sex differences in empathy from birth growing larger with age and consistent and stable across lifespan 91 65 93 females on average had higher empathy than males while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development 91 65 93 analysis of brain event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher erp waveforms than males 91 65 93 an investigation of n400 amplitudes found on average higher n400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self reported empathy 91 65 93 structural fmri studies also found females to have larger grey matter volumes in posterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons in fmri literature 91 65 93 females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy 91 65 93 the researchers believe that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by environmental influences but rather by human evolution and inheritance 91 65 93 throughout prehistory women were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non verbal expressions according to the primary caretaker hypothesis prehistoric men did not have such selective pressure as primary caretakers this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy 91 65 93 environmental influences edit some research theorizes that environmental factors such as parenting style and relationships affect the development of empathy in children empathy promotes pro social relationships 91 68 93 and helps mediate aggression caroline tisot studied how environmental factors like parenting style parent empathy and prior social experiences affect the development of empathy in young children the children studied were asked to complete an effective empathy measure while the children s parents completed a questionnaire to assess parenting style and the balanced emotional empathy scale the study found that certain parenting practices as opposed to parenting style as a whole contributed to the development of empathy in children these practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent paternal warmth was significantly positively related to empathy in children especially boys maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy in children especially girls 91 69 93 empathy may be disrupted due to brain trauma such as stroke in most cases empathy is impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain 91 70 93 damage to the frontal lobe which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation can profoundly impact a person s capacity to experience empathy 91 71 93 people with an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy more than half of those people with a traumatic brain injury self report a deficit in their empathic capacity 91 72 93 empathic anger and distress edit anger edit empathic anger is an emotion a form of empathic distress 91 73 93 empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing 91 74 93 empathic anger affects desires to help and to punish two sub categories of empathic anger are state empathic anger current empathic anger and trait empathic anger tendency or predisposition to experience empathic anger 91 75 93 the higher a person s perspective taking ability the less angry they are in response to a provocation empathic concern does not however significantly predict anger response and higher personal distress is associated with increased anger 91 76 93 distress edit main article personal distress empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person this feeling can be transformed into empathic anger feelings of injustice or guilt these emotions can be perceived as pro social however views differ as to whether they serve as motives for moral behavior 91 73 93 91 77 93 influence on helping behavior edit see also empathy altruism investigators into the social response to natural disasters researched the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims researchers found that cognitive empathy rather than emotional empathy predicted helping behavior towards victims 91 78 93 taking on the perspectives of others cognitive empathy may allow these helpers to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort whereas sharing the emotions of the victims emotional empathy can cause emotional distress helplessness and victim blaming and may lead to avoidance rather than helping 91 79 93 individuals who expressed concern for the vulnerable i e affective empathy were more willing to accept the covid 19 pandemic lockdown measures that create distress 91 80 93 knowledge of how empathic feelings evoke altruistic motivation may lead people to adopt strategies for suppressing or avoiding such feelings such numbing or loss of the capacity to feel empathy for clients is a possible factor in the experience of burnout among case workers in helping professions people can better cognitively control their actions the more they understand how altruistic behavior emerges whether it is from minimizing sadness or the arousal of mirror neurons empathy induced altruism may not always produce pro social effects for example it could lead one to exert oneself on behalf of those for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro social goals thus inducing a type of bias researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt 91 81 93 empathy based socialization differs from inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping modeling and internalized guilt therapeutic programs to foster altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations especially in the long term empathy induced altruism can improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups and to improve racial attitudes and actions toward people with aids the homeless and convicts such resulting altruism also increases cooperation in competitive situations 91 82 93 genetics edit general edit measures of empathy show evidence of being genetically influenced 91 83 93 for example carriers of the deletion variant of adra2b show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images 91 84 93 the gene 5 httlpr seems to influence sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of adra2b 91 85 93 carriers of the double g variant of the oxtr gene have better social skills and higher self esteem 91 clarification needed 93 91 86 93 a gene located near lrrn1 on chromosome 3 influences the human ability to read understand and respond to emotions in others 91 87 93 neuroscientific basis of empathy edit contemporary neuroscience offers insights into the neural basis of the mind s ability to understand and process emotion studies of mirror neurons attempt to measure the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities and thereby to explain the basis of the empathy reaction 91 88 93 people who score high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems 91 89 93 empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another s emotional state the empathic person mirrors or mimics the emotional response they would expect to feel if they were in the other person s place unlike personal distress empathy is not characterized by aversion to another s emotional response this distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy or empathic concern and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action 91 88 93 a person empathizes by feeling what they believe to be the emotions of another which makes empathy both affective and cognitive 91 clarification needed 93 91 13 93 for social beings negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape 91 90 93 meta analysis studies of functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies of empathy confirm that different brain areas are activated during affective perceptual empathy than during cognitive evaluative empathy affective empathy is correlated with increased activity in the insula while cognitive empathy is correlated with activity in the mid cingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 91 91 93 a study with patients who experienced different types of brain damage confirmed the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy 91 31 93 specifically the inferior frontal gyrus appears to be responsible for emotional empathy and the ventromedial prefrontal gyrus seems to mediate cognitive empathy 91 31 93 fmri has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy 91 92 93 observing another person s emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network that are involved in processing that same state in oneself whether it is disgust 91 93 93 touch 91 94 93 or pain 91 95 93 91 35 93 the study of the neural underpinnings of empathy received increased interest following a paper published by s d preston and frans de waal 91 96 93 after the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an action as well as when they themselves perform it researchers suggest that paying attention to perceiving another individual s state activates neural representations and that this activation primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses perception action coupling 91 97 93 unless inhibited this mechanism resembles the common coding theory between perception and action another study provides evidence of separate neural pathways activating reciprocal suppression in different regions of the brain associated with the performance of social and mechanical tasks these findings suggest that the cognition associated with reasoning about the state of another person s mind and causal mechanical properties of inanimate objects are neurally suppressed from occurring at the same time 91 98 93 mirroring behavior in motor neurons during empathy may help duplicate feelings 91 99 93 such sympathetic action may afford access to sympathetic feelings and perhaps trigger emotions of kindness and forgiveness 91 100 93 impairment edit a difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions psychopathy and narcissism are associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy whereas bipolar disorder and borderline traits are associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy 91 42 93 autism spectrum disorders are associated with various combinations including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy 91 30 93 91 31 93 91 42 93 91 34 93 91 101 93 91 102 93 schizophrenia too is associated with deficits in both types of empathy 91 103 93 however even in people without conditions such as these the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies 91 42 93 atypical empathic responses are associated with autism and particular personality disorders such as psychopathy borderline narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders conduct disorder 91 104 93 schizophrenia bipolar disorder 91 42 93 and depersonalization 91 105 93 sex offenders who had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured abuse of the sort they later committed felt less affective empathy for their victims 91 106 93 autism edit the interaction between empathy and autism is a complex and ongoing field of research several different factors are proposed to be at play a study of high functioning adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of alexithymia 91 107 93 a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others 91 107 93 91 108 93 some fmri research indicates that alexithymia contributes to a lack of empathy 91 109 93 the lack of empathic attunement inherent to alexithymic states may reduce quality 91 110 93 and satisfaction 91 111 93 of relationships empathy deficits associated with the autism spectrum may be due to significant comorbidity between alexithymia and autism spectrum conditions rather than a result of social impairment 91 112 93 relative to typically developing children high functioning autistic children showed reduced mirror neuron activity in the brain s inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis while imitating and observing emotional expressions in neurotypical children 91 113 93 eeg evidence revealed significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy 91 114 93 the mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy 91 31 93 studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired theory of mind 91 30 93 theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre frontal cortex empathy relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para limbic structures 91 115 93 the lack of clear distinctions between theory of mind and cognitive empathy may have caused an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with asperger syndrome many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind 91 30 93 91 116 93 91 117 93 although autistic people have difficulties in recognizing and articulating emotions some studies have reported that while they may lack cognitive empathy the ability to assume another s emotions they have higher than average levels of affective empathy feeling the emotions that another is feeling once they are known 91 118 93 individuals on the autistic spectrum self report lower levels of empathic concern show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls 91 34 93 the combination of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction in empathy 91 34 93 professor simon baron cohen suggests that those with classic autism often lack both cognitive and affective empathy 91 102 93 however other research found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints 91 119 93 people with asperger syndrome may have problems understanding others perspectives in terms of theory of mind but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as and higher personal distress than controls 91 30 93 the existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum is a possible explanation for why some people with autism appear to have heightened emotional empathy 91 34 93 91 101 93 although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism emotional empathy depends on mirror neuron activity which as described previously has been found to be reduced in those with autism and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced 91 31 93 91 34 93 empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others emotions these disorders of empathy further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by the way they illustrate some of the consequences of disrupted empathy development 91 120 93 the empathizing systemizing theory e s classifies people by testing their capabilities along two independent dimensions empathizing e and systemizing s to establish their empathy quotient eq and systemizing quotient sq five brain types can be distinguished based on such scores which are theorized to correlate with differences at the neural level in e s theory autism and asperger syndrome are associated with below average empathy and average or above average systemizing the e s theory has been extended into the extreme male brain theory which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an extreme type s brain type corresponding with above average systemizing but challenged empathy 91 121 93 the extreme male brain emb theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain specifically people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile some aspects of autistic neuroanatomy seem to be extrapolations of typical male neuroanatomy which may be influenced by elevated levels of fetal testosterone rather than gender itself 91 121 93 91 122 93 the double empathy problem theory proposes that prior studies on autism and empathy may have been misinterpreted and that autistic people show the same levels of cognitive empathy towards one another as non autistic people do 91 123 93 psychopathy edit psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of remorse and empathy 91 124 93 91 125 93 the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm and international classification of diseases icd list antisocial personality disorder aspd and dissocial personality disorder stating that these have been referred to as or include what is referred to as psychopathy 91 126 93 91 127 93 91 128 93 91 129 93 psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues e g facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear and impairments of empathy 91 130 93 91 131 93 91 132 93 91 133 93 studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations 91 134 93 91 135 93 91 136 93 the underlying biological surfaces 91 clarification needed 93 for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths although less responsive than in those of controls 91 133 93 91 134 93 91 135 93 91 136 93 the neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear some fmri studies report that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions positives and negatives 91 137 93 one study on psychopaths found that under certain circumstances they could willfully empathize with others and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls psychopathic criminals were brain scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual the psychopaths empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt the research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy on at will which would enable them to be both callous and charming the team who conducted the study say they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their empathy switch others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths experience of empathy was the same as that of controls and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic 91 138 93 91 139 93 one problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and punishment as psychopathy as these entail suspending empathy towards certain individuals and or groups the attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry s standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures as opposed to an actual difference in the brain 91 140 93 work conducted by professor jean decety with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights in one study psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt they were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain the participants in the high psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex amygdala and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain but more activity in the striatum and the insula when compared to control participants 91 141 93 in a second study individuals with psychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain affective brain regions when taking an imagine self perspective but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine other perspective in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala which may contribute to their lack of empathic concern 91 142 93 researchers have investigated whether people who have high levels of psychopathy have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but lack the ability to use affective empathy people who score highly on psychopathy measures are less likely to exhibit affective empathy there was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and lack of affective empathy correspond strongly the danva 2 91 clarification needed 93 found those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions therefore such individuals do not lack in perspective talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others 91 clarification needed 93 91 143 93 in fact in an experiment published in march 2007 at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio r damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these brain damaged patients coldly came up with end justifies the means answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains according to adrian raine a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this study s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability 91 144 93 despite studies suggesting psychopaths have deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain professor simon baron cohen claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors social cues and what others are feeling psychopathy is however associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy affective emotional empathy which includes the ability to feel the suffering and emotions of others emotional contagion and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has been demonstrated for aggressive offenders 91 145 93 other conditions edit atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions borderline personality disorder is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction 91 146 93 dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior plays a role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react 91 147 93 while individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions excessively several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states impaired cognitive empathy as well as an impaired theory of mind 91 147 93 people with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people s faces suggesting increased empathic capacities 91 148 93 91 149 93 impaired cognitive empathy the capacity for understanding another person s experience and perspective may account for borderline personality disorder individuals tendency for interpersonal dysfunction while hyper emotional empathy 91 verification needed 93 may account for their emotional over reactivity 91 147 93 one study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy 91 147 93 one diagnostic criterion of narcissistic personality disorder is a lack of empathy and an unwillingness or inability to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others 91 150 93 characteristics of schizoid personality disorder include emotional coldness detachment and impaired affect corresponding with an inability to be empathic and sensitive towards others 91 151 93 91 152 93 91 153 93 a study conducted by jean decety and colleagues at the university of chicago demonstrated that subjects with aggressive conduct disorder demonstrate atypical empathic responses when viewing others in pain 91 104 93 subjects with conduct disorder were at least as responsive as controls to the pain of others but unlike controls subjects with conduct disorder showed strong and specific activation of the amygdala and ventral striatum areas that enable a general arousing effect of reward yet impaired activation of the neural regions involved in self regulation and metacognition including moral reasoning in addition to diminished processing between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex 91 104 93 schizophrenia is characterized by impaired affective empathy 91 13 93 91 42 93 as well as severe cognitive and empathy impairments as measured by the empathy quotient eq 91 103 93 these empathy impairments are also associated with impairments in social cognitive tasks 91 103 93 bipolar individuals have impaired cognitive empathy and theory of mind but increased affective empathy 91 42 93 91 154 93 despite cognitive flexibility being impaired planning behavior is intact dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex could result in the impaired cognitive empathy since impaired cognitive empathy has been related with neurocognitive task performance involving cognitive flexibility 91 154 93 dave grossman in his book on killing reports on how military training artificially creates depersonalization in soldiers suppressing empathy and making it easier for them to kill other human beings 91 105 93 a deadening of empathic response to workmates customers and the like is one of the three key components of occupational burnout according to the conceptualisation behind its primary diagnostic instrument the maslach burnout inventory mbi the term empathy deficit disorder edd has gained popularity online but it is not a diagnosis under the dsm 5 the term was coined in an article by douglas labier phd 91 155 93 in the article he acknowledges that he made it up so you won t find it listed in the american psychiatric association s diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders and that his conclusions are derived from personal experience alone 91 155 93 his conclusions have not been validated through clinical studies nor have studies identified edd as a separate disorder rather than a symptom associated with previously established diagnoses that do appear in the dsm 5 in educational contexts edit another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners 91 156 93 although there is general agreement that empathy is essential in educational settings research has found that it is difficult to develop empathy in trainee teachers 91 157 93 learning by teaching lbt is one method used to teach empathy students transmit new content to their classmates so they have to reflect continuously on those classmates mental processes this develops the students feeling for group reactions and networking carl r rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have other research and meta analyses corroborated the importance of these person centered traits 91 158 93 in intercultural contexts edit main article ethnocultural empathy according to one theory empathy is one of seven components involved in the effectiveness of intercultural communication this theory also states that empathy is learnable however research also shows that people experience more difficulty empathizing with others who are different from them in characteristics such as status culture religion language skin colour gender and age 91 157 93 to build intercultural empathy in others psychologists employ empathy training us researchers william weeks paul pedersen et al state that people who develop intercultural empathy can interpret experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview 91 159 93 intercultural empathy can also improve self awareness and critical awareness of one s own interaction style as conditioned by one s cultural views 91 160 93 and promote a view of self as process 91 161 93 an alternative european approach to intercultural leadership considers four main dimensions cognitive leadership affective leadership relational leadership and emotional leadership 91 162 93 practical issues edit the capacity to empathize is a revered trait in society 91 30 93 empathy is considered a motivating factor for unselfish prosocial behavior 91 163 93 whereas a lack of empathy is related to antisocial behavior 91 30 93 91 164 93 91 165 93 91 166 93 apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning such empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another two general methods have been identified an individual may mentally simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs desires character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings this provokes or an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then analyze the environment to discover a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment 91 49 93 early 91 clarification needed 93 indicators for a lack of empathy frequently finding oneself in prolonged arguments forming opinions early and defending them vigorously thinking that other people are overly sensitive refusing to listen to other points of view blaming others for mistakes not listening when spoken to holding grudges and having difficulty to forgive inability to work in a team 91 citation needed 93 an empathizer s own emotional background may affect or distort how they perceive the emotions in others 91 167 93 societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy 91 clarification needed 93 91 168 93 the judgments that empathy provides about the emotional states of others are not certain ones empathy is a skill that gradually develops throughout life and which improves the more contact we have with the person with whom one empathizes 91 clarification needed 93 empathizers report finding it easier to take the perspective of another person in a situation when they have experienced a similar situation 91 169 93 and that they experience greater empathic understanding 91 170 93 research regarding whether similar past experience makes the empathizer more accurate is mixed 91 169 93 91 170 93 the extent to which a person s emotions are publicly observable or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable 91 example needed 93 this is particularly the case when we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions based on a metaphorical affinity with touch philosopher edith wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party 91 171 93 problems created by too much empathy and empathic bias edit some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves in particular empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent 91 172 93 91 173 93 a measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person s thoughts and feelings was developed by william ickes 91 clarification needed 93 91 64 93 in one experiment researchers gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported each participant received a mild electric shock then watched another go through the same pain when the wristbands matched both brains flared 91 clarification needed 93 with pain and empathic pain if they supported opposing teams the observer was found to have little empathy 91 174 93 psychologist paul bloom author of against empathy points out that this bias can result in tribalism and violent responses in the name of helping people of the same tribe or social group for example when empathic bias is exploited by demagogues 91 175 93 he proposes rational compassion as an alternative one example is using effective altruism to decide on charitable donations rationally rather than by relying on emotional responses to images in the media 91 175 93 empathy can also be exploited by sympathetic beggars bloom points to the example of street children in india who can get many donations because they are adorable but this results in their enslavement by organized crime bloom says that though someone might feel better about themselves and find more meaning 91 clarification needed 93 when they give to the person in front of them in some cases they would do less harm and in many cases do more good in the world by giving to an effective charity through an impersonal website 91 175 93 bloom believes improper use of empathy and social intelligence can lead to shortsighted actions and parochialism 91 77 93 he further defies conventional supportive research findings as gremlins from biased standards 91 clarification needed 93 bloom says that although psychopaths have low empathy the correlation between low empathy and violent behavior as documented in scientific studies is zero 91 175 93 other measures are much more predictive of violent behavior such as lack of self control 91 175 93 people with asperger syndrome and autism also have low empathy but are more often the victim of violent attacks than the perpetrators 91 175 93 bloom points out that parents who have too much short term empathy might create long term problems for their children by neglecting discipline helicopter parenting or deciding not to get their children vaccinated because of the short term discomfort 91 175 93 people experiencing too much empathy after a disaster may continue to send donations like canned goods or used clothing even after being asked to stop or send cash instead and this can make the situation worse by creating the need to dispose of useless donations and taking resources away from helpful activities 91 175 93 bloom also finds empathy can encourage unethical behavior when it causes people to care more about attractive people than ugly people or people of one s own race vs people of a different race 91 175 93 the attractiveness bias can also affect wildlife conservation efforts increasing the amount of money devoted and laws passed to protect cute and photogenic animals while taking attention away from species that are more ecologically important 91 175 93 empathic distress fatigue edit excessive empathy can lead to empathic distress fatigue especially if it is associated with pathological altruism the medical 91 clarification needed 93 risks are fatigue occupational burnout guilt shame anxiety and depression 91 176 93 91 177 93 tania singer says that health care workers and caregivers must be objective regarding the emotions of others they should not over invest their own emotions in the other at the risk of draining away their own resourcefulness 91 178 93 paul bloom points out that high empathy nurses tend to spend less time with their patients to avoid feeling negative emotions associated with witnessing suffering 91 175 93 disciplinary approaches edit philosophy edit ethics edit in the 2007 book the ethics of care and empathy philosopher michael slote introduces a theory of care based ethics that is grounded in empathy his claim is that moral motivation does and should stem from a basis of empathic response he claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy he explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural these natural obligations include a greater empathic and moral obligation to family and friends and to those close to us in time and space our moral obligation to such people seems naturally stronger to us than that to strangers at a distance slote explains that this is due to the natural process of empathy he asserts that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent 91 179 93 phenomenology edit in phenomenology empathy describes the experience of something from the other s viewpoint without confusion between self and other this draws on 91 clarification needed 93 the sense of agency in the most basic sense this is the experience of the other s body as my body over there in most other respects however what is experienced is experienced as being the other s experience in experiencing empathy what is experienced is not my experience even though i experience it empathy is also considered to be the condition of intersubjectivity and as such the source of the constitution of objectivity 91 jargon 93 91 180 93 history edit some postmodern historians such as keith jenkins have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant liberal discourse of modern society and can be connected to john stuart mill s concept of reciprocal freedom jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the epistemological conditions of bygone ages we are unable to empathize with those who lived then 91 181 93 psychotherapy edit heinz kohut introduced the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis his principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material business and management edit in the 2009 book wired to care strategy consultant dev patnaik argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations he states that without empathy people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon he says that companies can create a sense of empathy for customers pointing to nike harley davidson and ibm as examples of open empathy organizations such companies he claims see new opportunities more quickly than competitors adapt to change more easily and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs 91 182 93 in the 2011 book the empathy factor organizational consultant marie miyashiro similarly argues for bringing empathy to the workplace and suggests nonviolent communication as an effective mechanism for achieving this 91 183 93 in studies by the management research group empathy was found to be the strongest predictor of ethical leadership behavior out of 22 competencies in its management model and empathy was one of the three strongest predictors of senior executive effectiveness 91 184 93 a study by the center for creative leadership found empathy to be positively correlated to job performance among employees as well 91 185 93 evolution of cooperation edit empathic perspective taking plays important roles in sustaining cooperation in human societies as studied by evolutionary game theory in game theoretical models indirect reciprocity refers to the mechanism of cooperation based on moral reputations that are assigned to individuals based on their perceived adherence a set of moral rules called social norms it has been shown that if reputations are relative 91 clarification needed 93 and individuals disagree on the moral standing of others for example because they use different moral evaluation rules or make errors of judgement then cooperation will not be sustained however when individuals have the capacity for empathic perspective taking altruistic behavior can once again evolve 91 40 93 moreover evolutionary models also revealed that empathic perspective taking itself can evolve promoting prosocial behavior in human populations 91 186 93 measurement edit efforts to measure empathy go back to at least the mid twentieth century 91 10 93 91 187 93 researchers approach the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad hoc 91 clarification needed 93 behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring both verbal and non verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as truax 91 188 93 other experimenters including mehrabian and epstein 91 189 93 required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors or those of other people involved in the experiment as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject s body researchers then draw inferences about that person s empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced 91 190 93 bodily or somatic measures can be seen as behavioral measures at a micro level they measure empathy through facial and other non verbally expressed reactions such changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of emotional contagion or mirroring 91 190 93 these reactions while they appear to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer could also if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period reflect the results of emotional reactions based on cognitions associated with role taking if i were him i would feel picture or puppet story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young pre school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers 91 191 93 dependent variables variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter for younger subjects have included self reporting on a seven point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions 91 192 93 in some experiments subjects are required to watch video scenarios either staged or authentic and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy 91 193 93 scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form 91 194 93 self report measures edit measures of empathy also frequently require subjects to self report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy using likert style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to reveal the affective cognitive affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning some questionnaires claim to reveal both cognitive and affective substrates 91 195 93 however a 2019 meta analysis questions the validity of self report measures of cognitive empathy finding that such self report measures have negligibly small correlations with corresponding behavioral measures 91 39 93 in the field of medicine a measurement tool for carers is the jefferson scale of physician empathy health professional version jspe hp 91 196 93 the interpersonal reactivity index iri is among the oldest published measurement tools still in frequent use first published in 1983 that provides a multi dimensional assessment of empathy it comprises a self report questionnaire of 28 items divided into four 7 item scales covering the subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy described above 91 30 93 91 33 93 more recent self report tools include the empathy quotient eq created by baron cohen and wheelwright 91 197 93 which comprises a self report questionnaire consisting of 60 items another multi dimensional scale is the questionnaire of cognitive and affective empathy qcae first published in 2011 91 198 93 the empathic experience scale is a 30 item questionnaire that measures empathy from a phenomenological perspective on intersubjectivity which provides a common basis for the perceptual experience vicarious experience dimension and a basic cognitive awareness intuitive understanding dimension of others emotional states 91 199 93 international comparison of country wide empathy edit in a 2016 study by a us research team self report data from the interreactivity index see measurement were compared across countries from the surveyed nations the nations with the five highest empathy scores were in descending order ecuador saudi arabia peru denmark and united arab emirates the lowest scores came from bulgaria poland estonia venezuela and lithuania 91 200 93 other animals and empathy between species edit see also emotion in animals researchers zanna clay and frans de waal studied the socio emotional development of the bonobo chimpanzee 91 201 93 they focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy related responding and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events events related to themselves e g loss of a fight as well as stressful events of others they found that bonobos sought out body contact with one another as a coping mechanism bonobos sought out more body contact after watching an event distress other bonobos than after their individually experienced stressful event mother reared bonobos sought out more physical contact than orphaned bonobos after a stressful event happened to another this finding shows the importance of mother child attachment and bonding in successful socio emotional development such as empathic like behaviors empathic like behavior has been observed in chimpanzees in different aspects of their natural behaviors for example chimpanzees spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in both natural and unnatural settings a behavior recognized as 91 who 93 consolation researchers led by teresa romero observed these empathic and sympathetic like behaviors in chimpanzees in two separate outdoor housed 91 clarification needed 93 groups 91 202 93 acts of consolation were observed in both groups this behavior is found in humans particularly in human infants another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic like responding was disproportionately provided to kin although comforting towards non family chimpanzees was also observed as with humans chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close loved ones another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average the only exception to this discovery was that high ranking males showed as much empathy like behavior as their female counterparts this is believed to be because of policing like behavior and the authoritative status of high ranking male chimpanzees canines have been hypothesized to share empathic like responding towards human species researchers custance and mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger 91 203 93 when the participants were talking or humming the dog showed no behavioral changes however when the participants were pretending to cry the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger the dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion by sniffing licking and nuzzling the distressed person the dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement tail wagging or panting since the dogs did not direct their empathic like responses only towards their owner it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior although this could suggest that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy it could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior when witnessing chicks in distress domesticated hens gallus gallus domesticus show emotional and physiological responding researchers edgar paul and nicol 91 204 93 found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger the mother hen s heart rate increased it sounded vocal alarms it decreased its personal preening and its body temperature increased this responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if it were in danger mother hens experienced stress induced hyperthermia only when the chick s behavior correlated with the perceived threat animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy however it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality 91 clarification needed 93 humans can empathize with other species one study of a sample of organisms showed that the strength of human empathic perceptions and compassionate reactions toward an organism is negatively correlated with how long ago our species had a common ancestor in other words the more phylogenetically close a species is to us the more likely we are to feel empathy and compassion towards it 91 205 93 in fiction edit the power of empathy has become a frequent ability in fiction specifically in that of superhero media users known as empaths have the ability to sense feel the emotions and bodily sensations of others and in some cases influence or control them although sometimes a specific power held by users such as marvel comics character empath the power has also been frequently linked to that of telepathy such as in the case of jean grey the rebooted television series charmed sees the character maggie vera as a witch with the power of empathy her powers later expand to allow her to control the emotions of others as well as occasionally concentrate emotion into pure energy in season 4 she learns to replicate people s powers by empathically understanding them see also edit against
