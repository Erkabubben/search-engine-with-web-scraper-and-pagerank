impulsivity from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search tendency to act on a whim without considering consequences orbitofrontal cortex part of the prefrontal cortex that shapes decision making in psychology impulsivity or impulsiveness is a tendency to act on a whim displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought reflection or consideration of the consequences 91 1 93 impulsive actions are typically poorly conceived prematurely expressed unduly risky or inappropriate to the situation that often result in undesirable consequences 91 2 93 which imperil long term goals and strategies for success 91 3 93 impulsivity can be classified as a multifactorial construct 91 4 93 a functional variety of impulsivity has also been suggested which involves action without much forethought in appropriate situations that can and does result in desirable consequences when such actions have positive outcomes they tend not to be seen as signs of impulsivity but as indicators of boldness quickness spontaneity courageousness or unconventionality 91 2 93 91 5 93 thus the construct of impulsivity includes at least two independent components first acting without an appropriate amount of deliberation 91 2 93 which may or may not be functional and second choosing short term gains over long term ones 91 6 93 impulsivity is both a facet of personality and a major component of various disorders including fasd adhd 91 7 93 substance use disorders 91 8 93 91 9 93 bipolar disorder 91 10 93 antisocial personality disorder 91 11 93 and borderline personality disorder 91 10 93 abnormal patterns of impulsivity have also been noted instances of acquired brain injury 91 12 93 and neurodegenerative diseases 91 13 93 neurobiological findings suggest that there are specific brain regions involved in impulsive behavior 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 although different brain networks may contribute to different manifestations of impulsivity 91 17 93 91 18 93 and that genetics may play a role 91 19 93 many actions contain both impulsive and compulsive features but impulsivity and compulsivity are functionally distinct impulsivity and compulsivity are interrelated in that each exhibits a tendency to act prematurely or without considered thought and often include negative outcomes 91 20 93 91 21 93 compulsivity may be on a continuum with compulsivity on one end and impulsivity on the other but research has been contradictory on this point 91 22 93 compulsivity occurs in response to a perceived risk or threat impulsivity occurs in response to a perceived immediate gain or benefit 91 20 93 and whereas compulsivity involves repetitive actions impulsivity involves unplanned reactions impulsivity is a common feature of the conditions of gambling and alcohol addiction research has shown that individuals with either of these addictions discount delayed money at higher rates than those without and that the presence of gambling and alcohol abuse lead to additive effects on discounting 91 23 93 contents 1 impulse 2 the five traits that can lead to impulsive actions 3 associated behavioral and societal

can be considered as a normal and fundamental part of human thought processes but also one that can become problematic as in a condition like obsessive compulsive disorder 91 24 93 91 unreliable medical source 93 borderline personality disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders the ability to control impulses or more specifically control the desire to act on them is an important factor in personality and socialization deferred gratification also known as impulse control is an example of this concerning impulses primarily relating to things that a person wants or desires delayed gratification comes when one avoids acting on initial impulses delayed gratification has been studied in relation to childhood obesity resisting the urge to act on impulses is important to teach children because it teaches the value of delayed gratification 91 25 93 many psychological problems are characterized by a loss of control or a lack of control in specific situations usually this lack of control is part of a pattern of behavior that also involves other maladaptive thoughts and actions such as substance abuse problems or sexual disorders like the paraphilias e g pedophilia and exhibitionism when loss of control is only a component of a disorder it usually does not have to be a part of the behavior pattern and other symptoms must also be present for the diagnosis to be made franklin 91 26 93 91 unreliable medical source 93 the five traits that can lead to impulsive actions edit for many years it was understood that impulsivity is a trait but with further analysis it can be found that there were five traits that can lead to impulsive actions positive urgency negative urgency sensation seeking lack of planning and lack of perseverance 91 27 93 91 28 93 91 29 93 91 30 93 associated behavioral and societal problems edit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder edit attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is a multiple component disorder involving inattention impulsivity and hyperactivity the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv tr 91 31 93 breaks adhd into three subtypes according to the behavioral symptoms attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly hyperactive impulsive type and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder combined type predominantly hyperactive impulsive type symptoms may include fidgeting and squirming in seats talking nonstop dashing around and touching or playing with anything in sight having trouble sitting still during dinner school story time being constantly in motion and having difficulty doing quiet tasks or activities other manifestations primarily of impulsivity include being very impatient having difficulty waiting for things they want or waiting their turns in games often interrupting conversations or others activities or blurting out inappropriate comments showing their emotions without restraint and act without regard for consequences prevalence of the disorder worldwide is estimated to be between 4 and 10 with reports as low as 2 2 and as high as 17 8 variation in rate of diagnoses may be attributed to differences between populations i e culture and differences in diagnostic methodologies 91 32 93 prevalence of adhd among females is less than half that of males and females more commonly fall into the inattentive subtype 91 33 93 despite an upward trend in diagnoses of the inattentive subtype of adhd impulsivity is commonly considered to be the central feature of adhd and the impulsive and combined subtypes are the major contributors to the societal costs associated with adhd 91 33 93 91 34 93 the estimated cost of illness for a child with adhd is 14 576 in 2005 dollars annually 91 35 93 prevalence of adhd among prison populations is significantly higher than that of the normal population 91 36 93 in both adults 91 37 93 and children 91 38 93 91 39 93 adhd has a high rate of comorbidity with other mental health disorders such as learning disability conduct disorder anxiety disorder major depressive disorder bipolar disorder and substance use disorders the precise genetic and environmental factors contributing to adhd are relatively unknown but endophenotypes offer a potential middle ground between genes and symptoms 91 40 93 adhd is commonly linked to core deficits involving executive function delay aversion or activation arousal theories that attempt to explain adhd through its symptomology 91 40 93 endophenotypes on the other hand purport to identify potential behavioral markers that correlate with specific genetic etiology there is some evidence to support deficits in response inhibition as one such marker problems inhibiting prepotent responses are linked with deficits in pre frontal cortex pfc functioning which is a common dysfunction associated with adhd and other impulse control disorders 91 41 93 91 42 93 evidence based psychopharmacological and behavioral interventions exist for adhd 91 43 93 substance abuse edit impulsivity appears to be linked to all stages of substance abuse 91 44 93 91 45 93 the acquisition phase of substance abuse involves the escalation from single use to regular use 91 44 93 impulsivity may be related to the acquisition of substance abuse because of the potential role that instant gratification provided by the substance may offset the larger future benefits of abstaining from the substance and because people with impaired inhibitory control may not be able to overcome motivating environmental cues such as peer pressure 91 46 93 similarly individuals that discount the value of delayed reinforcers begin to abuse alcohol marijuana and cigarettes early in life while also abusing a wider array of illicit drugs compared to those who discounted delayed reinforcers less 91 47 93 escalation or dysregulation is the next and more severe phase of substance abuse in this phase individuals lose control of their addiction with large levels of drug consumption and binge drug use animal studies suggest that individuals with higher levels of impulsivity may be more prone to the escalation stage of substance abuse 91 44 93 impulsivity is also related to the abstinence relapse and treatment stages of substance abuse people who scored high on the barratt impulsivity scale bis were more likely to stop treatment for cocaine abuse 91 48 93 additionally they adhered to treatment for a shorter duration than people that scored low on impulsivity 91 48 93 also impulsive people had greater cravings for drugs during withdrawal periods and were more likely to relapse this effect was shown in a study where smokers that test high on the bis had increased craving in response to smoking cues and gave into the cravings more quickly than less impulsive smokers 91 49 93 taken as a whole the current research suggests that impulsive individuals are less likely to abstain from drugs and more likely to relapse earlier than less impulsive individuals 91 44 93 while it is important to note the effect of impulsivity on substance abuse the reciprocating effect whereby substance abuse can increase impulsivity has also been researched and documented 91 44 93 the promoting effect of impulsivity on substance abuse and the effect of substance abuse on increased impulsivity creates a positive feedback loop that maintains substance seeking behaviors it also makes conclusions about the direction of causality difficult this phenomenon has been shown to be related to several substances but not all for example alcohol has been shown to increase impulsivity while amphetamines have had mixed results 91 44 93 substance use disorder treatments include prescription of medications such as acamprosate buprenorphine disulfiram laam methadone and naltrexone 91 50 93 as well as effective psychotherapeutic treatment like behavioral couples therapy cbt contingency management motivational enhancement therapy and relapse prevention 91 50 93 eating edit impulsive overeating spans from an episode of indulgence by an otherwise healthy person to chronic binges by a person with an eating disorder 91 citation needed 93 consumption of a tempting food by non clinical individuals increases when self regulatory resources are previously depleted by another task suggesting that it is caused by a breakdown in self control 91 51 93 impulsive eating of unhealthy snack foods appears to be regulated by individual differences in impulsivity when self control is weak and by attitudes towards the snack and towards healthy eating when self control is strong 91 52 93 there is also evidence that greater food consumption occurs when people are in a sad mood although it is possible that this is due more to emotional regulation than to a lack of self control 91 53 93 in these cases overeating will only take place if the food is palatable to the person and if so individual differences in impulsivity can predict the amount of consumption 91 54 93 chronic overeating is a behavioral component of binge eating disorder compulsive overeating and bulimia nervosa these diseases are more common for women and may involve eating thousands of calories at a time depending on which of these disorders is the underlying cause an episode of overeating can have a variety of different motivations characteristics common among these three disorders include low self esteem depression eating when not physically hungry preoccupation with food eating alone due to embarrassment and feelings of regret or disgust after an episode in these cases overeating is not limited to palatable foods 91 55 93 impulsivity differentially affects disorders involving the overcontrol of food intake such as anorexia nervosa and disorders involving the lack of control of food intake such as bulimia nervosa cognitive impulsivity such as risk taking is a component of many eating disorders including those that are restrictive 91 56 93 however only people with disorders involving episodes of overeating have elevated levels of motoric impulsivity such as reduced response inhibition capacity 91 56 93 one theory suggests that binging provides a short term escape from feelings of sadness anger or boredom although it may contribute to these negative emotions in the long term 91 57 93 another theory suggests that binge eating involves reward seeking as evidenced by decreased serotonin binding receptors of binge eating women compared to matched weight controls 91 58 93 and predictive value of heightened reward sensitivity drive in dysfunctional eating 91 59 93 treatments for clinical grade overeating include cognitive behavioral therapy to teach people how to track and change their eating habits and actions interpersonal psychotherapy to help people analyze the contribution of their friends and family in their disorder and pharmacological therapies including antidepressants and ssris 91 60 93 impulse buying edit impulse buying consists of purchasing a product or service without any previous intent to make that purchase 91 61 93 it has been speculated to account for as much as eighty percent of all purchases 91 62 93 in the united states 91 relevant 93 there are several theories pertaining to impulsive buying one theory suggests that it is exposure combining with the speed that a reward can be obtained that influences an individual to choose lesser immediate rewards over greater rewards that can be obtained later 91 63 93 for example a person might choose to buy a candy bar because they are in the candy aisle even though they had decided earlier that they would not buy candy while in the store another theory is one of self regulation 91 57 93 which suggests that the capacity to refrain from impulsive buying is a finite resource as this capacity is depleted with repeated acts of restraint susceptibility to purchasing other items on impulse increases 91 citation needed 93 finally a third theory suggests an emotional and behavioral tie between the purchaser and the product which drives both the likelihood of an impulsive purchase as well as the degree that a person will retroactively be satisfied with that purchase result 91 64 93 91 65 93 some studies have shown a large number of individuals are happy with purchases made on impulse 41 in one study 91 66 93 which is explained as a preexisting emotional attachment which has a positive relationship both with the likelihood of initiating the purchase as well as mitigating post purchase satisfaction 91 65 93 as an example when purchasing team related college paraphernalia a large percentage of those purchases are made on impulse and are tied to the degree with which a person has positive ties to that team 91 65 93 impulsive buying is seen both as an individual trait in which each person has a preconditioned or hereditary allotment as well as a situational construct which is mitigated by such things as emotion in the moment of the purchase and the preconditioned ties an individual has with the product 91 57 93 91 65 93 psychotherapy and pharmacological treatments have been shown to be helpful interventions for patients with impulsive compulsive buying disorder 91 67 93 psychotherapy interventions include the use of desensitization techniques 91 68 93 self help books 91 69 93 or attending a support group 91 69 93 pharmacological interventions include the use of ssris such as fluvoxamine 91 70 93 91 71 93 citalopram 91 72 93 91 73 93 escitalopram 91 74 93 and naltrexone 91 75 93 91 76 93 impulse control disorders not elsewhere classified edit impulse control disorder icds are a class of dsm diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual e g substance use disorders and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences 91 31 93 individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms compelling urge or desire failure to resist the urge a heightened sense of arousal succumbing to the urge which usually yields relief from tension and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed 91 77 93 specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder kleptomania pathological gambling pyromania trichotillomania hair pulling disorder and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified icd nos icd nos includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific dsm diagnosis 91 31 93 there has been much debate over whether or not the icds deserve a diagnostic category of their own or whether they are in fact phenomenologically and epidemiologically related to other major psychiatric conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder ocd affective disorders and addictive disorders 91 78 93 in fact the icd classification is likely to change with the release of the dsm v in may 2013 91 79 93 in this new revision the icd nos will likely be reduced or removed proposed revisions include reclassifying trichotillomania to be renamed hair pulling disorder and skin picking disorder as obsessive compulsive and related disorders moving intermittent explosive disorder under the diagnostic heading of disruptive impulse control and conduct disorders and gambling disorder may be included in addiction and related disorders 91 79 93 the role of impulsivity in the icds varies research on kleptomania and pyromania is lacking though there is some evidence that greater kleptomania severity is tied to poor executive functioning 91 80 93 trichotillomania and skin picking disorder seem to be disorders that primarily involve motor impulsivity 91 81 93 91 82 93 and will likely be classified in the dsm v within the obsessive compulsive and related disorders category 91 79 93 pathological gambling in contrast seems to involve many diverse aspects of impulsivity and abnormal reward circuitry similar to substance use disorders that has led to it being increasingly conceptualized as a non substance or behavioral addiction 91 83 93 evidence elucidating the role of impulsivity in pathological gambling is accumulating with pathological gambling samples demonstrating greater response impulsivity choice impulsivity and reflection impulsivity than comparison control samples 91 83 93 additionally pathological gamblers tend to demonstrate greater response perseveration compulsivity and risky decisionmaking in laboratory gambling tasks compared to controls though there is no strong evidence suggesting that attention and working memory are impaired in pathological gamblers 91 83 93 these relations between impulsivity and pathological gambling are confirmed by brain function research pathological gamblers demonstrate less activation in the frontal cortical regions implicated in impulsivity compared to controls during behavioral tasks tapping response impulsivity compulsivity and risk reward 91 83 93 preliminary though variable findings also suggest that striatal activation is different between gamblers and controls and that neurotransmitter differences e g dopamine serotonin opioids glutamate norepinephrine may exist as well 91 83 93 individuals with intermittent explosive disorder also known as impulsive aggression have exhibited serotonergic abnormalities and show differential activation in response to emotional stimuli and situations 91 84 93 notably intermittent explosive disorder is not associated with a higher likelihood of diagnosis with any of the other icds but is highly comorbid with disruptive behavior disorders in childhood 91 84 93 intermittent explosive disorder is likely to be re classified in the dsm v under the heading of disruptive impulse control and conduct disorders 91 79 93 these sorts of impulse control disorders are most often treated using certain types of psychopharamcological interventions e g antidepressants and behavioral treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy 91 citation needed 93 theories of impulsivity edit ego cognitive depletion edit according to the ego or cognitive depletion theory of impulsivity self control refers to the capacity for altering one s own responses especially to bring them into line with standards such as ideals values morals and social expectations and to support the pursuit of long term goals 91 85 93 self control enables a person to restrain or override one response thereby making a different response possible 91 85 93 a major tenet of the theory is that engaging in acts of self control draws from a limited reservoir of self control that when depleted results in reduced capacity for further self regulation 91 86 93 91 87 93 self control is viewed as analogous to a muscle just as a muscle requires strength and energy to exert force over a period of time acts that have high self control demands also require strength and energy to perform 91 88 93 similarly as muscles become fatigued after a period of sustained exertion and have reduced capacity to exert further force self control can also become depleted when demands are made of self control resources over a period of time baumeister and colleagues termed the state of diminished self control strength ego depletion or cognitive depletion 91 87 93 the strength model of self control asserts that just as exercise can make muscles stronger there are signs that regular exertions of self control can improve willpower strength 91 89 93 these improvements typically take the form of resistance to depletion in the sense that performance at self control tasks deteriorates at a slower rate 91 85 93 targeted efforts to control behavior in one area such as spending money or exercise lead to improvements in unrelated areas such as studying or household chores and daily exercises in self control such as improving posture altering verbal behavior and using one s nondominant hand for simple tasks gradually produce improvements in self control as measured by laboratory tasks 91 85 93 the finding that these improvements carry over into tasks vastly different from the daily exercises shows that the improvements are not due to simply increasing skill or acquiring self efficacy from practice 91 85 93 just as athletes begin to conserve their remaining strength when their muscles begin to tire so do self controllers when some of their self regulatory resources have been expended the severity of behavioral impairment during depletion depends in part on whether the person expects further challenges and demands 91 85 93 when people expect to have to exert self control later they will curtail current performance more severely than if no such demands are anticipated 91 90 93 consistent with the conservation hypothesis people can exert self control despite ego depletion if the stakes are high enough offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion 91 91 93 this may seem surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive given the value and importance of the capacity for self control it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength 91 85 93 when people do exert themselves on the second task they deplete the resource even more as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated 91 90 93 empirical tests of the ego depletion effect typically adopt dual task paradigm 91 86 93 91 92 93 91 93 93 participants assigned to an experimental ego depletion group are required to engage in two consecutive tasks requiring self control 91 88 93 control participants are also required to engage in two consecutive tasks but only the second task requires self control the strength model predicts that the performance of the experimental group on the second self control task will be impaired relative to that of the control group this is because the finite self control resources of the experimental participants will be diminished after the initial self control task leaving little to draw on for the second task 91 85 93 the effects of ego depletion do not appear to be a product of mood or arousal in most studies mood and arousal has not been found to differ between participants who exerted self control and those who did not 91 86 93 91 94 93 likewise mood and arousal was not related to final self control performance 91 94 93 the same is true for more specific mood items such as frustration irritation annoyance boredom or interest as well feedback about success and failure of the self control efforts does not appear to affect performance 91 95 93 in short the decline in self control performance after exerting self control appears to be directly related to the amount of self control exerted and cannot be easily explained by other well established psychological processes 91 94 93 automatic vs controlled processes cognitive control edit dual process theory states that mental processes operate in two separate classes automatic and controlled in general automatic processes are those that are experiential in nature occur without involving higher levels of cognition 91 96 93 and are based on prior experiences or informal heuristics controlled decisions are effortful and largely conscious processes in which an individual weighs alternatives and makes a more deliberate decision 91 citation needed 93 automatic process automatic processes have four main features 91 97 93 they occur unintentionally or without a conscious decision the cost of the decision is very low in mental resources they cannot be easily stopped and they occur without conscious thought on the part of the individual making them controlled process controlled processes also have four main features 91 97 93 that are very close to the opposite in spectrum from their automatic counterparts controlled processes occur intentionally they require the expenditure of cognitive resources the individual making the decision can stop the process voluntarily and the mental process is a conscious one dual process theories at one time considered any single action thought as either being automatic or controlled 91 97 93 however currently they are seen as operating more along a continuum as most impulsive actions will have both controlled and automatic attributes 91 97 93 automatic processes are classified according to whether they are meant to inhibit or to facilitate a thought process 91 98 93 for example in one study 91 99 93 researchers offered individuals a choice between a 1 in 10 chance of winning a prize and a 10 in 100 chance many participants chose one of the choices over the other without identifying that the chances inherent in each were the same as they saw either only 10 chances total as more beneficial or of having 10 chances to win as more beneficial in effect impulsive decisions can be made as prior information and experiences dictate one of the courses of action is more beneficial when in actuality careful consideration would better enable the individual to make a more informed and improved decision 91 citation needed 93 intertemporal choice edit intertemporal choice is defined as decisions with consequences that play out over time 91 100 93 this is often assessed using the relative value people assign to rewards at different points in time either by asking experimental subjects to choose between alternatives or examining behavioral choices in a naturalistic setting 91 citation needed 93 intertemporal choice is commonly measured in the laboratory using a delayed discounting paradigm which measures the process of devaluing rewards and punishments that happen in the future 91 100 93 in this paradigm subjects must choose between a smaller reward delivered soon and a larger reward delivered at a delay in the future choosing the smaller sooner reward is considered impulsive by repeatedly making these choices indifference points can be estimated for example if someone chose 70 now over 100 in a week but chose the 100 in a week over 60 now it can be inferred that they are indifferent between 100 in a week and an intermediate value between 60 and 70 a delay discounting curve can be obtained for each participant by plotting their indifference points with different reward amounts and time delays individual differences in discounting curves are affected by personality characteristics such as self reports of impulsivity and locus of control personal characteristics such as age gender iq race and culture socioeconomic characteristics such as income and education and many other variables 91 101 93 to drug addiction 91 102 93 91 103 93 lesions of the nucleus accumbens core subregion 91 104 93 or basolateral amygdala 91 105 93 produce shifts towards choosing the smaller sooner reward suggesting the involvement of these brain regions in the preference for delayed reinforcers there is also evidence that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in delay discounting although there is currently debate on whether lesions in this region result in more or less impulsivity 91 106 93 economic theory suggests that optimal discounting involves the exponential discounting of value over time this model assumes that people and institutions should discount the value of rewards and punishments at a constant rate according to how delayed they are in time 91 100 93 while economically rational recent evidence suggests that people and animals do not discount exponentially many studies suggest that humans and animals discount future values according to a hyperbolic discounting curve where the discount factor decreases with the length of the delay for example waiting from today to tomorrow involves more loss of value than waiting from twenty days to twenty one days further evidence for non constant delay discounting is suggested by the differential involvement of various brain regions in evaluating immediate versus delayed consequences specifically the prefrontal cortex is activated when choosing between rewards at a short delay or a long delay but regions associated with the dopamine system are additionally activated when the option of an immediate reinforcer is added 91 107 93 additionally intertemporal choices differ from economic models because they involve anticipation which may involve a neurological reward even if the reinforcer is delayed self control and the breakdown of it when faced with temptations and representation how the choice is framed may influence desirability of the reinforcer 91 100 93 none of which are accounted for by a model that assumes economic rationality 91 citation needed 93 one facet of intertemporal choice is the possibility for preference reversal when a tempting reward becomes more highly valued than abstaining only when immediately available 91 3 93 for example when sitting home alone a person may report that they value the health benefit of not smoking a cigarette over the effect of smoking one however later at night when the cigarette is immediately available their subjective value of the cigarette may rise and they may choose to smoke it 91 citation needed 93 a theory called the primrose path is intended to explain how preference reversal can lead to addiction in the long run 91 108 93 as an example a lifetime of sobriety may be more highly valued than a lifetime of alcoholism but at the same time one drink now may be more highly valued than not drinking now because it is always now the drink is always chosen and a paradoxical effect occurs whereby the more valued long term alternative is not achieved because the more valued short term alternative is always chosen this is an example of complex ambivalence 91 109 93 when a choice is made not between two concrete alternatives but between one immediate and tangible alternative i e having a drink and one delayed and abstract alternative i e sobriety similarities between humans and non human animals in intertemporal choice have been studied pigeons 91 110 93 and rats 91 111 93 also discount hyperbolically tamarin monkeys do not wait more than eight seconds to triple the amount of a food reward 91 112 93 the question arises as to whether this is a difference of homology or analogy that is whether the same underlying process underlies human animal similarities or whether different processes are manifesting in similar patterns of results 91 citation needed 93 inhibitory control edit main article inhibitory control inhibitory control often conceptualized as an executive function is the ability to inhibit or hold back a prepotent response 91 113 93 it is theorized that impulsive behavior reflects a deficit in this ability to inhibit a response impulsive people may find it more difficult to inhibit action whereas non impulsive people may find it easier to do so 91 113 93 there is evidence that in normal adults commonly used behavioral measures of inhibitory control correlate with standard self report measures of impulsivity 91 114 93 inhibitory control may itself be multifaceted evidenced by numerous distinct inhibition constructs that can be measured in different ways and relate to specific types of psychopathology 91 115 93 joel nigg developed a useful working taxonomy of these different types of inhibition drawing heavily from the fields of cognitive and personality psychology 91 115 93 nigg s eight proposed types of inhibition include the following executive inhibition edit interference control edit suppression of a stimulus that elicits an interfering response enabling a person to complete the primary response interference control can also refer to suppressing distractors 91 115 93 interference control has been measured using cognitive tasks like the stroop test flanker tasks dual task interference and priming tasks 91 116 93 personality researchers have used the rothbart effortful control measures and the conscientiousness scale of the big five as inventory measures of interference control based on imaging and neural research it is theorized that the anterior cingulate the dorsolateral prefrontal premotor cortex and the basal ganglia are related to interference control 91 117 93 91 118 93 cognitive inhibition edit cognitive inhibition is the suppression of unwanted or irrelevant thoughts to protect working memory and attention resources 91 115 93 cognitive inhibition is most often measured through tests of directed ignoring self report on one s intrusive thoughts and negative priming tasks as with interference control personality psychologists have measured cognitive inhibition using the rothbart effortful control scale and the big five conscientiousness scale the anterior cingulate the prefrontal regions and the association cortex seem to be involved in cognitive inhibition 91 115 93 behavioral inhibition edit behavioral inhibition is the suppression of prepotent response 91 115 93 behavioral inhibition is usually measured using the go no go task stop signal task and reports of suppression of attentional orienting surveys that are theoretically relevant to behavioral inhibition include the rothbart effortful control scale and the big five conscientiousness dimension 91 115 93 the rationale behind the use of behavioral measures like the stop signal task is that go processes and stop processes are independent and that upon go and stop cues they race against each other if the go process wins the race the prepotent response is executed whereas if the stop processes wins the race the response is withheld in this context impulsivity is conceptualized as a relatively slow stop process 91 119 93 the brain regions involved in behavioral inhibition appear to be the lateral and orbital prefrontal regions along with premotor processes oculomotor inhibition edit oculomotor inhibition is the effortful suppression of reflexive saccade 91 115 93 oculomotor inhibition is tested using antisaccade and oculomotor tasks also the rothbart effortful control measure and the big five conscientiousness dimension are thought to tap some of the effortful processes underlying the ability to suppress saccade the frontal eye fields and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are involved in oculomotor inhibition 91 115 93 motivational inhibition edit in response to punishment edit motivational inhibition and response in the face of punishment can be measured using tasks tapping inhibition of primary response modified go no go tasks inhibition of competing response and emotional stroop tasks 91 115 93 personality psychologists also use the gray behavioral inhibition system measure the eysenck scale for neurotic introversion and the zuckerman neuroticism anxiety scale 91 115 93 the septal hippocampal formation cingulate and motor systems seem to be the brain areas most involved in response to punishment 91 115 93 in response to novelty edit response to novelty has been measured using the kagan behavioral inhibition system measure and scales of neurotic introversion 91 115 93 the amygdaloid system is implicated in novelty response 91 115 93 automatic inhibition of attention edit recently inspected stimuli edit suppression of recently inspected stimuli for both attention and oculomotor saccade is usually measured using attentional and oculomotor inhibition of return tests the superior colliculus and the midbrain oculomotor pathway are involved in suppression of stimuli 91 115 93 neglected stimuli edit information at locations that are not presently being attended to is suppressed while attending elsewhere 91 115 93 this involves measures of covert attentional orienting and neglect along with personality scales on neuroticism 91 115 93 the posterior association cortex and subcortical pathways are implicated in this sort of inhibition 91 115 93 action inaction goals edit recent psychology research also yields out the condition of impulsivity in relation to peoples general goal setting it is possible these action and inaction goals are underlying people s behavioral differences in their daily lives since they can demonstrate patterns comparable to natural variation in overall activity levels 91 120 93 more specifically the level of impulsivity and mania people have might positive correlated with favorable attitudes about and goals of general action while negatively respond to favorable attitudes about and goals of general inaction assessment of impulsivity edit personality tests and reports edit barratt impulsiveness scale edit the barratt impulsiveness scale bis is one of the oldest and most widely used measures of impulsive personality traits the first bis was developed in 1959 by dr ernest barratt 91 121 93 it has been revised extensively to achieve two major goals 1 to identify a set of impulsiveness items that was orthogonal to a set of anxiety items as measured by the taylor manifest anxiety scale mas or the cattell anxiety scale and 2 to define impulsiveness within the structure of related personality traits like eysenck s extraversion dimension or zuckerman s sensation seeking dimension especially the disinhibition subfactor 91 121 93 the bis 11 with 30 items was developed in 1995 91 122 93 according to patton and colleagues there are 3 subscales attentional impulsiveness motor impulsiveness and non planning impulsiveness with six factors 91 122 93 attention focusing on a task at hand motor impulsiveness acting on the spur of the moment self control planning and thinking carefully cognitive complexity enjoying challenging mental tasks perseverance a consistent life style cognitive instability thought insertion and racing thoughts eysenck impulsiveness scale edit the eysenck impulsiveness scale eis 91 123 93 is a 54 item yes no questionnaire designed to measure impulsiveness three subscales are computed from this measure impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy impulsiveness is defined as behaving without thinking and without realizing the risk involved in the behavior 91 124 93 venturesomeness is conceptualized as being conscious of the risk of the behavior but acting anyway 91 124 93 the questionnaire was constructed through factor analysis to contain items that most highly loaded on impulsiveness and venturesomeness 91 124 93 the eis is a widely used and well validated measure 91 124 93 dickman impulsivity inventory edit the dickman impulsivity inventory was first developed in 1990 by scott j dickman this scale is based on dickman s proposal that there are two types of impulsivity that are significantly different from one another 91 125 93 this includes functional impulsivity which is characterized by quick decision making when it is optimal a trait that is often considered to be a source of pride the scale also includes dysfunctional impulsivity which is characterized by making quick decisions when it is not optimal this type of impulsivity is most often associated with life difficulties including substance abuse problems and other negative outcomes 91 126 93 this scale includes 63 items of which 23 are related to dysfunctional impulsivity 17 are related to functional impulsivity and 23 are filler questions that relate to neither construct 91 126 93 this scale has been developed into a version for use with children 91 127 93 as well as into several languages dickman showed there is no correlation between these two tendencies across individuals and they also have different cognitive correlates 91 125 93 upps impulsive behavior scale edit the upps impulsive behavior scale 91 128 93 is a 45 item self report questionnaire that was designed to measure impulsivity across dimensions of the five factor model of personality the upps includes 4 sub scales lack of premeditation urgency lack of perseverance and sensation seeking upps p impulsive behavior scale upps p 91 129 93 is a revised version of the upps including 59 items it assesses an additional personality pathway to impulsive behavior positive urgency in addition to the four pathways assessed in the original version of the scale urgency now negative urgency lack of premeditation lack of perseverance and sensation seeking upps p short version upps ps 91 130 93 is 20 item scale that evaluates five different impulsivity facets 4 items per dimension upps r interview 91 131 93 is a semi structured interview that measures the degree to which individuals exhibit the various components of impulsivity assessed by the upps p lifetime history of impulsive behaviors edit lifetime history of impulsive behaviors lhib 91 132 93 is a 53 item questionnaire designed to assess lifetime history of impulsive behavior as opposed to impulsive tendencies as well as the level of distress and impairment associated with these behaviors 91 133 93 the assessment battery was designed to measure the following six dimensions a impulsivity b sensation seeking c trait anxiety d state depression e empathy and f social desirability the lhib consists of scales for clinically significant impulsivity non clinically significant impulsivity and impulsivity related distress impairment 91 133 93 behavioral inhibition system behavioral activation system edit behavioral inhibition system behavioral activation system bis bas 91 134 93 was developed based on the gray s biopsychological theory of personality which suggests that there are two general motivational systems that underlie behavior and affect bis and bas this 20 item self report questionnaire is designed to assess dispositional bis and bas sensitivities impulsive premeditated aggression scale edit impulsive premeditated aggression scale ipas 91 135 93 is a 30 item self report questionnaire half of the items describe impulsive aggression and half the items describe premeditated aggression aggressive behavior has traditionally been classified into two distinct subtypes impulsive or premeditated impulsive aggression is defined as a hair trigger aggressive response to provocation with loss of behavioral control 91 135 93 premeditated aggression is defined as a planned or conscious aggressive act not spontaneous or related to an agitated state 91 135 93 the ipas is designed to characterize aggressive behavior as predominately impulsive or predominately premeditated in nature 91 135 93 those subjects who clustered on the impulsive factor showed a broad range of emotional and cognitive impairments those who clustered on the premeditated factor showed a greater inclination for aggression and anti social behaviour 91 135 93 91 136 93 padua inventory edit the padua inventory pi consists of 60 items describing common obsessional and compulsive behavior and allows investigation of such problems in normal and clinical subjects 91 137 93 behavioral paradigms edit a wide variety of behavioral tests have been devised for the assessment of impulsivity in both clinical and experimental settings while no single test is a perfect predictor or a sufficient replacement for an actual clinical diagnosis when used in conjunction with parent teacher reports behavioral surveys and other diagnostic criteria the utility of behavioral paradigms lies in their ability to narrow in on specific discrete aspects of the impulsivity umbrella quantifying specific deficits is of use to the clinician and the experimenter both of whom are generally concerned with obtaining objectively measurable treatment effects 91 citation needed 93 marshmallow test edit one widely recognizable test for impulsivity is the delay of gratification paradigm commonly known as the marshmallow test 91 63 93 developed in the 1960s to assess willpower and self control in preschoolers the marshmallow test consists of placing a single marshmallow in front of a child and informing them that they will be left alone in the room for some duration the child is told that if the marshmallow remains uneaten when the experimenter returns they will be awarded a second marshmallow both of which can then be eaten 91 citation needed 93 91 138 93 despite its simplicity and ease of administration evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that the number of seconds preschoolers wait to obtain the second marshmallow is predictive of higher sat scores better social and emotional coping in adolescence higher educational achievement and less cocaine crack use 91 139 93 91 140 93 91 141 93 delay discounting edit like the marshmallow test delay discounting is also a delay of gratification paradigm 91 142 93 it is designed around the principle that the subjective value of a reinforcer decreases or is discounted as the delay to reinforcement increases subjects are given varying choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards by manipulating reward magnitude and or reward delay over multiple trials indifference points can be estimated whereby choosing the small immediate reward or the large delayed reward are about equally likely subjects are labeled impulsive when their indifference points decline more steeply as a function of delay compared to the normal population i e greater preference for immediate reward unlike the marshmallow test delay discounting does not require verbal instruction and can be implemented on non human animals 91 143 93 go no go and stop signal reaction time tasks edit two common tests of response inhibition used in humans are the go no go task and a slight variant known as the stop signal reaction time ssrt test during a go no task the participant is trained over multiple trials to make a particular response e g a key press when presented with a go signal on some trials a stop signal is presented just prior to or simultaneously with the go signal and the subject must inhibit the impending response the ssrt test is similar except that the stop signal is presented after the go signal this small modification increases the difficulty of inhibiting the go response because the participant has typically already initiated the go response by the time the stop signal is presented 91 144 93 the participant is instructed to respond as fast as possible to the go signal while maintaining the highest possible inhibition accuracy on no go trials during the task the time at which the stop signal is presented the stop signal delay or ssd is dynamically adjusted to match the time after the go signal at which the participant is just able unable to inhibit their go response if the participant fails to inhibit their go response the stop signal is moved slightly closer to the original go signal and if the participant successfully inhibits their go response the stop signal is moved slightly ahead in time the ssrt is thus measured as the average go response time minus the average stop signal presentation time ssd balloon analogue risk task edit the balloon analogue risk task bart was designed to assess risk taking behavior 91 145 93 subjects are presented with a computer depiction of a balloon that can be incrementally inflated by pressing a response key as the balloon inflates the subject accumulates rewards with each new key press the balloon is programmed with a constant probability of popping if the balloon pops all rewards for that balloon are lost or the subject may choose to stop inflating and bank the reward for that balloon at any time therefore more key presses equate to greater reward but also greater probability of popping and cancelling rewards for that trial the bart assumes that those with an affinity for risk taking are more likely to pop the balloon earning less reward overall than the typical population 91 citation needed 93 iowa gambling task edit the iowa gambling task igt is a test originally meant to measure decision making specifically within individuals who have ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage 91 146 93 the concept of impulsivity as relates to the igt is one in which impulsive decisions are a function of an individual s lack of ability to make rational decisions over time due to an over amplification of emotional somatic reward 91 147 93 in the igt individuals are provided four decks of cards to choose from two of these decks provide much higher rewards but the deductions are also much higher while the second two decks have lower rewards per card but also much lower deductions over time anyone who chooses predominantly from the high rewards decks will lose money while those who choose from the smaller rewards decks will gain money the igt uses hot and cold processes in its concept of decision making 91 147 93 hot decision making involves emotional responses to the material presented based on motivation related to reward and punishment cold processes occur when an individual uses rational cognitive determinations when making decisions combined an individual should gain a positive emotional reaction when choices have beneficial consequences and will have negative emotional responses tied to choices that have greater negative consequences in general healthy responders to the igt will begin to drift to the lower gain decks as they realize that they are gaining more money than they lose both through an ability to recognize that one is more consistently providing rewards as well as through the emotions related to winning consistently however those who have emotional deficits will fail to recognize that they are losing money over time and will continue to be more influenced by the exhilaration of higher value rewards without being influenced by the negative emotions of the loses associated with them 91 citation needed 93 for more information concerning these process refer to the somatic marker hypothesis differential reinforcement of low response rate task edit differential reinforcement of low response rate drl described by ferster and skinner 91 148 93 is used to encourage low rates of responding it is derived from research in operant conditioning that provides an excellent opportunity to measure the hyperactive child s ability to inhibit behavioral responding hyperactive children were relatively unable to perform efficiently on the task and this deficit endured regardless of age iq or experimental condition 91 149 93 therefore it can be used to discriminate accurately between teacher rated and parent rated hyperactive and nonhyperactive children in this procedure responses that occur before a set time interval has passed are not reinforced and reset the time required between behaviors 91 citation needed 93 in a study a child was taken to the experimental room and told that they were going to play a game in which they had a chance to win a lot of m amp m s every time they made the light of the reward indicator by pressing a red button they would earn an m amp m s however they had to wait a while 6 seconds before they could press it to get another point if they had pressed the button too soon then they would have not gotten a point and the light would not go on and they had to wait a while before they could press it to get another point 91 citation needed 93 researchers have also observed that subjects in a time based situation will often engage in a sequence or chain of behaviors between reinforceable responses 91 149 93 this is because this collateral behavior sequence helps the subject wait out the required temporal delay between responses 91 citation needed 93 other edit other common impulsivity tasks include the continuous performance task cpt 5 choice serial reaction time task 5 csrtt stroop task and matching familiar figures task pharmacology and neurobiology edit neurobiological findings edit although the precise neural mechanisms underlying disorders of impulse control are not fully known the prefrontal cortex pfc is the brain region most ubiquitously implicated in impulsivity 91 150 93 damage to the prefrontal cortex has been associated with difficulties preparing to act switching between response alternatives and inhibiting inappropriate responses 91 144 93 recent research has uncovered additional regions of interest as well as highlighted particular subregions of the pfc that can be tied to performance in specific behavioral tasks 91 citation needed 93 delay discounting edit excitotoxic lesions in the nucleus accumbens core have been shown to increase preference for the smaller immediate reward whereas lesions to the nucleus accumbens shell have had no observable effect additionally lesions of the basolateral amygdala a region tied closely to the pfc negatively affect impulsive choice similarly to what is observed in the nucleus accumbens core lesions 91 106 93 moreover dorsal striatum may also be involved in impulsive choice in an intricate manner 91 151 93 go no go and stop signal reaction time test edit the orbitofrontal cortex is now thought to play a role in disinhibiting 91 152 93 and injury to other brain structures such as to the right inferior frontal gyrus a specific subregion of the pfc has been associated with deficits in stop signal inhibition 91 153 93 5 choice serial reaction time task 5 csrtt and differential reinforcement of low rates drl edit as with delay discounting lesion studies have implicated the core region of the nucleus accumbens in response inhibition for both drl and 5 csrtt premature responses in the 5 csrtt may also be modulated by other systems within the ventral striatum 91 citation needed 93 in the 5 csrtt lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex have been shown to increase impulsive responding and lesions to the prelimbic cortex impair attentional performance 91 154 93 iowa gambling task edit patients with damage to the ventromedial frontal cortex exhibit poor decision making and persist in making risky choices in the iowa gambling task 91 146 93 91 155 93 neurochemical and pharmacological findings edit the primary pharmacological treatments for adhd are methylphenidate ritalin and amphetamine both methylphenidate and amphetamines block re uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into the pre synaptic neuron acting to increase post synaptic levels of dopamine and norepinephrine of these two monoamines increased availability of dopamine is considered the primary cause for the ameliorative effects of adhd medications whereas increased levels of norepinephrine may be efficacious only to the extent that it has downstream indirect effects on dopamine 91 156 93 the effectiveness of dopamine re uptake inhibitors in treating the symptoms of adhd has led to the hypothesis that adhd may arise from low tonic levels of dopamine particularly in the fronto limbic circuitry but evidence in support of this theory is mixed 91 157 93 91 158 93 genetics edit there are several difficulties when it comes to trying to identify a gene for complex traits such as impulsivity such as genetic heterogeneity another difficulty is that the genes in question might sometimes show incomplete penetrance where a given gene variant does not always cause the phenotype 91 159 93 much of the research on the genetics of impulsivity related disorders such as adhd is based on family or linkage studies 91 160 93 there are several genes of interest that have been studied in an attempt to find the major genetic contributors to impulsivity some of these genes are dat1 is the dopamine transporter gene which is responsible for the active reuptake of dopamine from the neural synapse dat1 polymorphisms have been shown to be linked to hyperactivity and adhd 91 161 93 drd4 is the dopamine d4 receptor gene and is associated with adhd and novelty seeking behaviors 91 159 93 91 162 93 it has been proposed that novelty seeking is associated with impulsivity mice deficient for drd4 have shown less behavioral responses to novelty 91 163 93 5ht2a is the serotonin receptor gene the serotonin 2a receptor gene has been associated with both hyper locomotion adhd as well as impulsivity subjects with a particular polymorphism of the 5ht2a gene made more commission errors during a punishment reward condition in a go no go task 91 164 93 htr2b a serotonin receptor gene 91 165 93 ctnna2 encodes for a brain expressed catenin that has been associated with excitement seeking in a genome wide association study gwas of 7860 individuals 91 19 93 intervention edit interventions to impact impulsivity generally edit while impulsivity can take on pathological forms e g substance use disorder adhd there are less severe non clinical forms of problematic impulsivity in many people s daily lives research on the different facets of impulsivity can inform small interventions to change decision making and reduce impulsive behavior 91 166 93 for example changing cognitive representations of rewards e g making long term rewards seem more concrete and or creating situations of precommitment eliminating the option of changing one s mind later can reduce the preference for immediate reward seen in delay discounting 91 166 93 brain training edit brain training interventions include laboratory based interventions e g training using tasks like go no go as well as community family and school based interventions that are ecologically valid e g teaching techniques for regulating emotions or behaviors and can be used with individuals with non clinical levels of impulsivity 91 167 93 both sorts of interventions are aimed at improving executive functioning and self control capacities with different interventions specifically targeting different aspects of executive functioning like inhibitory control working memory or attention 91 167 93 emerging evidence suggests that brain training interventions may succeed in impacting executive function including inhibitory control 91 168 93 inhibitory control training specifically is accumulating evidence that it can help individuals resist temptation to consume high calorie food 91 169 93 and drinking behavior 91 170 93 some have voiced concerns that the favorable results of studies testing working memory training should be interpreted with caution claiming that conclusions regarding changes to abilities are measured using single tasks inconsistent use of working memory tasks no contact control groups and subjective measurements of change 91 171 93 treatment of specific disorders of impulsivity edit behavioral psychosocial and psychopharmacological treatments for disorders involving impulsivity are common psychopharmacological intervention edit psychopharmacological intervention in disorders of impulsivity has shown evidence of positive effects common pharmacological interventions include the use of stimulant medication selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris and other antidepressants 91 78 93 adhd has a well established evidence base supporting the use of stimulant medication for the reduction of adhd symptoms 91 172 93 pathological gambling has also been studied in drug trials and there is evidence that gambling is responsive to ssris and other antidepressants 91 78 93 evidence based pharmacological treatment for trichotillomania is not yet available with mixed results of studies investigating the use of ssris though cognitive behavioral therapy has shown positive effects 91 78 93 intermittent explosive disorder is most often treated with mood stabilizers ssris beta blockers alpha agonists and anti psychotics all of which have shown positive effects 91 78 93 there is evidence that some pharmacological interventions are efficacious in treating substance use disorders though their use can depend on the type of substance that is abused 91 50 93 pharmacological treatments for substance use disorders include acamprosate buprenorphine disulfiram laam methadone and naltrexone 91 50 93 behavioral interventions edit behavioral interventions also have a fairly strong evidence base in impulse control disorders 91 78 93 in adhd the behavioral interventions of behavioral parent training behavioral classroom management and intensive peer focused behavioral interventions in recreational settings meet stringent guidelines qualifying them for evidence based treatment status 91 173 93 in addition a recent meta analysis of evidence based adhd treatment found organization training to be a well established treatment method 91 174 93 empirically validated behavioral treatments for substance use disorder are fairly similar across substance use disorders and include behavioral couples therapy cbt contingency management motivational enhancement therapy and relapse prevention 91 50 93 pyromania and kleptomania are understudied due in large part to the illegality of the behaviors though there is some evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions cbt short term counseling day treatment programs are efficacious in treating pyromania while kleptomania seems to be best addressed using ssris 91 78 93 additionally therapies including cbt family therapy and social skill training have shown positive effects on explosive aggressive behaviors 91 78 93 see also edit affect adhd addiction deferred gratification drive
