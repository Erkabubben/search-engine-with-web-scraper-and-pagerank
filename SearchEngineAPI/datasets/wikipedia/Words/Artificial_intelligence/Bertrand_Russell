russell wrote i spent all my spare time reading him and learning him by heart knowing no one to whom i could speak of what i thought or felt i used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know shelley and to wonder whether i should meet any live human being with whom i should feel so much sympathy 91 96 93 russell claimed that beginning at age 15 he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of christian religious dogma which he found unconvincing 91 97 93 at this age he came to the conclusion that there is no free will and two years later that there is no life after death

russell was impressed by the precision of peano s arguments at the congress read the literature upon returning to england and came upon russell s paradox in 1903 he published the principles of mathematics a work on foundations of mathematics it advanced a thesis of logicism that mathematics and logic are one and the same 91 115 93 at the age of 29 in february 1901 russell underwent what he called a sort of mystic illumination after witnessing whitehead s wife s acute suffering in an angina attack i found myself filled with semi mystical feelings about beauty and with a desire almost as profound as that of the buddha to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable russell would later recall at the end of those five minutes i had become a completely different person 91 116 93 in 1905 he wrote the essay on denoting which was published in the philosophical journal mind russell was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1908 91 66 93 91 76 93 the three volume principia mathematica written with whitehead was published between 1910 and 1913 this along with the earlier the principles of mathematics soon made russell world famous in his field in 1910 he became a university of cambridge lecturer at trinity college where he had studied he was considered for a fellowship which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions but was passed over because he was anti clerical essentially because he was agnostic he was approached by the austrian engineering student ludwig wittgenstein who became his phd student russell viewed wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic he spent hours dealing with wittgenstein s various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair this was often a drain on russell s energy but russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development including the publication of wittgenstein s tractatus logico philosophicus in 1922 91 117 93 russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism his version of these ideas in 1918 before the end of world war i wittgenstein was at that time serving in the austrian army and subsequently spent nine months in an italian prisoner of war camp at the end of the conflict first world war edit russell served on the national committee of the no conscription fellowship shown here in may 1916 91 118 93 back right during world war i russell was one of the few people to engage in active pacifist activities in 1916 because of his lack of a fellowship he was dismissed from trinity college following his conviction under the defence of the realm act 1914 91 119 93 he later described this in free thought and official propaganda as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression russell championed the case of eric chappelow a poet jailed and abused as a conscientious objector 91 120 93 russell played a significant part in the leeds convention in june 1917 a historic event which saw well over a thousand anti war socialists gather many being delegates from the independent labour party and the socialist party united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement 91 121 93 the international press reported that russell appeared with a number of labour members of parliament mps including ramsay macdonald and philip snowden as well as former liberal mp and anti conscription campaigner professor arnold lupton after the event russell told lady ottoline morrell that to my surprise when i got up to speak i was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody 91 122 93 91 123 93 his conviction in 1916 resulted in russell being fined 100 equivalent to 6 000 32 in 2021 which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison but his books were sold at auction to raise the money the books were bought by friends he later treasured his copy of the king james bible that was stamped confiscated by cambridge police a later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the united states to enter the war on the united kingdom s side resulted in six months imprisonment in brixton prison see bertrand russell s political views in 1918 91 124 93 he later said of his imprisonment i found prison in many ways quite agreeable i had no engagements no difficult decisions to make no fear of callers no interruptions to my work i read enormously i wrote a book introduction to mathematical philosophy and began the work for the analysis of mind i was rather interested in my fellow prisoners who seemed to me in no way morally inferior to the rest of the population though they were on the whole slightly below the usual level of intelligence as was shown by their having been caught 91 125 93 while he was reading strachey s eminent victorians chapter about gordon he laughed out loud in his cell prompting the warder to intervene and reminding him that prison was a place of punishment 91 126 93 russell was reinstated to trinity in 1919 resigned in 1920 was tarner lecturer in 1926 and became a fellow again in 1944 until 1949 91 127 93 in 1924 russell again gained press attention when attending a banquet in the house of commons with well known campaigners including arnold lupton who had been an mp and had also endured imprisonment for passive resistance to military or naval service 91 128 93 g h hardy on the trinity controversy edit in 1941 g h hardy wrote a 61 page pamphlet titled bertrand russell and trinity published later as a book by cambridge university press with a foreword by c d broad in which he gave an authoritative account of russell s 1916 dismissal from trinity college explaining that a reconciliation between the college and russell had later taken place and gave details about russell s personal life hardy writes that russell s dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the fellows of the college opposed the decision the ensuing pressure from the fellows induced the council to reinstate russell in january 1920 it was announced that russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from trinity and would begin lecturing from october in july 1920 russell applied for a one year leave of absence this was approved he spent the year giving lectures in china and japan in january 1921 it was announced by trinity that russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted this resignation hardy explains was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation the reason for the resignation according to hardy was that russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage russell contemplated asking trinity for another one year leave of absence but decided against it since this would have been an unusual application and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy although russell did the right thing in hardy s opinion the reputation of the college suffered with russell s resignation since the world of learning knew about russell s altercation with trinity but not that the rift had healed in 1925 russell was asked by the council of trinity college to give the tarner lectures on the philosophy of the sciences these would later be the basis for one of russell s best received books according to hardy the analysis of matter published in 1927 91 129 93 in the preface to the trinity pamphlet hardy wrote i wish to make it plain that russell himself is not responsible directly or indirectly for the writing of the pamphlet i wrote it without his knowledge and when i sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it i suggested that unless it contained misstatement of fact he should make no comment on it he agreed to this no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him between the wars edit in august 1920 russell travelled to soviet russia as part of an official delegation sent by the british government to investigate the effects of the russian revolution 91 130 93 he wrote a four part series of articles titled soviet russia 1920 for the magazine the nation 91 131 93 91 132 93 he met vladimir lenin and had an hour long conversation with him in his autobiography he mentions that he found lenin disappointing sensing an impish cruelty in him and comparing him to an opinionated professor he cruised down the volga on a steamship his experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution he subsequently wrote a book the practice and theory of bolshevism 91 133 93 about his experiences on this trip taken with a group of 24 others from the uk all of whom came home thinking well of the soviet regime despite russell s attempts to change their minds for example he told them that he had heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure that these were clandestine executions but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring 91 citation needed 93 russell with his children john and kate russell s lover dora black a british author feminist and socialist campaigner visited soviet russia independently at the same time in contrast to his reaction she was enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution 91 133 93 the following year russell accompanied by dora visited peking as beijing was then known outside of china to lecture on philosophy for a year 91 93 93 he went with optimism and hope seeing china as then being on a new path 91 134 93 other scholars present in china at the time included john dewey 91 135 93 and rabindranath tagore the indian nobel laureate poet 91 93 93 before leaving china russell became gravely ill with pneumonia and incorrect reports of his death were published in the japanese press 91 135 93 when the couple visited japan on their return journey dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading mr bertrand russell having died according to the japanese press is unable to give interviews to japanese journalists 91 136 93 91 137 93 apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully 91 citation needed 93 91 138 93 91 139 93 dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to england on 26 august 1921 russell arranged a hasty divorce from alys marrying dora six days after the divorce was finalised on 27 september 1921 russell s children with dora were john conrad russell 4th earl russell born on 16 november 1921 and katharine jane russell now lady katharine tait born on 29 december 1923 russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics ethics and education to the layman bertrand russell in 1924 from 1922 to 1927 the russells divided their time between london and cornwall spending summers in porthcurno 91 140 93 in the 1922 and 1923 general elections russell stood as a labour party candidate in the chelsea constituency but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe conservative seat and he was unsuccessful on both occasions after the birth of his two children he became interested in education especially early childhood education he was not satisfied with the old traditional education and thought that progressive education also had some flaws 91 141 93 as a result together with dora russell founded the experimental beacon hill school in 1927 the school was run from a succession of different locations including its original premises at the russells residence telegraph house near harting west sussex during this time he published on education especially in early childhood on 8 july 1930 dora gave birth to her third child harriet ruth after he left the school in 1932 dora continued it until 1943 91 142 93 91 143 93 in 1927 russell met barry fox later barry stevens who became a well known gestalt therapist and writer in later years 91 144 93 they developed an intensive relationship and in fox s words 160 for three years we were very close 91 145 93 fox sent her daughter judith to beacon hill school 91 146 93 from 1927 to 1932 russell wrote 34 letters to fox 91 147 93 upon the death of his elder brother frank in 1931 russell became the 3rd earl russell russell s marriage to dora grew increasingly tenuous and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an american journalist griffin barry 91 143 93 they separated in 1932 and finally divorced on 18 january 1936 russell married his third wife an oxford undergraduate named patricia peter spence who had been his children s governess since 1930 russell and peter had one son conrad sebastian robert russell 5th earl russell who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the liberal democrat party 91 76 93 russell returned in 1937 to the london school of economics to lecture on the science of power 91 112 93 during the 1930 s russell became a friend and collaborator of v k krishna menon then president of the india league the foremost lobby in the united kingdom for indian independence 91 73 93 russell chaired the india league from 1932 to 1939 91 148 93 second world war edit russell s political views changed over time mostly about war he opposed rearmament against nazi germany in 1937 he wrote in a personal letter if the germans succeed in sending an invading army to england we should do best to treat them as visitors give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister 91 149 93 in 1940 he changed his appeasement view that avoiding a full scale world war was more important than defeating hitler he concluded that adolf hitler taking over all of europe would be a permanent threat to democracy in 1943 he adopted a stance toward large scale warfare called relative political pacifism war was always a great evil but in some particularly extreme circumstances it may be the lesser of two evils 91 150 93 91 151 93 before world war ii russell taught at the university of chicago later moving on to los angeles to lecture at the ucla department of philosophy 91 152 93 he was appointed professor at the city college of new york ccny in 1940 but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him morally unfit to teach at the college because of his opinions especially those relating to sexual morality detailed in marriage and morals 1929 the matter was however taken to the new york supreme court by jean kay who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment though her daughter was not a student at ccny 91 152 93 91 153 93 many intellectuals led by john dewey protested at his treatment 91 154 93 albert einstein s oft quoted aphorism that great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds originated in his open letter dated 19 march 1940 to morris raphael cohen a professor emeritus at ccny supporting russell s appointment 91 155 93 dewey and horace m kallen edited a collection of articles on the ccny affair in the bertrand russell case russell soon joined the barnes foundation lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy these lectures formed the basis of a history of western philosophy his relationship with the eccentric albert c barnes soon soured and he returned to the uk in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of trinity college 91 156 93 later life

wide variety of subjects even mundane ones en route to one of his lectures in trondheim russell was one of 24 survivors among a total of 43 passengers of an aeroplane crash in hommelvik in october 1948 he said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non smoking part of the plane 91 157 93 91 158 93 a history of western philosophy 1945 became a best seller and provided russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life in 1942 russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles in an inquiry on dialectical materialism launched by the austrian artist and philosopher wolfgang paalen in his journal dyn russell said i think the metaphysics of both hegel and marx plain nonsense marx s claim to be science is no more justified than mary baker eddy s this does not mean that i am opposed to socialism 91 159 93 in 1943 russell expressed support for zionism i have come gradually to see that in a dangerous and largely hostile world it is essential to jews to have some country which is theirs some region where they are not suspected aliens some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture 91 160 93 in a speech in 1948 russell said that if the ussr s aggression continued it would be morally worse to go to war after the ussr possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one because if the ussr had no bomb the west s victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atomic bombs on both sides 91 161 93 91 162 93 at that time only the united states possessed an atomic bomb and the ussr was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in eastern europe which were being absorbed into the soviet union s sphere of influence many understood russell s comments to mean that russell approved of a first strike in a war with the ussr including nigel lawson who was present when russell spoke of such matters others including griffin who obtained a transcript of the speech have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of america s atomic arsenal in deterring the ussr from continuing its domination of eastern europe 91 157 93 just after the atomic bombs exploded over hiroshima and nagasaki russell wrote letters and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948 stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the ussr using atomic bombs while the united states possessed them and before the ussr did 91 163 93 in september 1949 one week after the ussr tested its first a bomb but before this became known russell wrote that ussr would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following stalin s purges only science based on marxist principles would be practised in the soviet union 91 164 93 after it became known that the ussr had carried out its nuclear bomb tests russell declared his position advocating the total abolition of atomic weapons 91 163 93 in 1948 russell was invited by the bbc to deliver the inaugural reith lectures 91 165 93 what was to become an annual series of lectures still broadcast by the bbc his series of six broadcasts titled authority and the individual 91 166 93 explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society russell continued to write about philosophy he wrote a foreword to words and things by ernest gellner which was highly critical of the later thought of ludwig wittgenstein and of ordinary language philosophy gilbert ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal mind which caused russell to respond via the times the result was a month long correspondence in the times between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy 91 167 93 in the king s birthday honours of 9 june 1949 russell was awarded the order of merit 91 168 93 and the following year he was awarded the nobel prize in literature 91 76 93 91 93 93 when he was given the order of merit george vi was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird saying you have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted 91 169 93 russell merely smiled but afterwards claimed that the reply that s right just like your brother immediately came to mind in 1950 russell attended the inaugural conference for the congress for cultural freedom a cia funded anti communist organisation committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the cold war 91 170 93 russell was one of the best known patrons of the congress until he resigned in 1956 91 171 93 in 1952 russell was divorced by spence with whom he had been very unhappy 91 citation needed 93 conrad russell s son by spence did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother russell married his fourth wife edith finch soon after the divorce on 15 december 1952 they had known each other since 1925 and edith had taught english at bryn mawr college near philadelphia sharing a house for 20 years with russell s old friend lucy donnelly edith remained with him until his death and by all accounts their marriage was a happy close and loving one russell s eldest son john suffered from serious mental illness which was the source of ongoing disputes between russell and his former wife dora 91 citation needed 93 in september 1961 at the age of 89 russell was jailed for seven days in brixton prison for a breach of the peace after taking part in an anti nuclear demonstration in london the magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to good behaviour to which russell replied no i won t 91 172 93 91 173 93 in 1962 russell played a public role in the cuban missile crisis in an exchange of telegrams with soviet leader nikita khrushchev khrushchev assured him that the soviet government would not be reckless 91 174 93 91 175 93 russell sent this telegram to president kennedy your action desperate threat to human survival no conceivable justification civilized man condemns it we will not have mass murder ultimatum means war end this madness 91 176 93 according to historian peter knight after jfk s assassination russell prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer mark lane in the us rallied support from other noteworthy and left leaning compatriots to form a who killed kennedy committee in june 1964 members of which included michael foot mp caroline benn the publisher victor gollancz the writers john arden and j b priestley and the oxford history professor hugh trevor roper russell published a highly critical article weeks before the warren commission report was published setting forth 16 questions on the assassination and equating the oswald case with the dreyfus affair of late 19th century france in which the state convicted an innocent man russell also criticised the american press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version 91 177 93 political causes edit russell centre alongside his wife edith leading a cnd anti nuclear march in london 18 february 1961 bertrand russell was opposed to war from a young age his opposition to world war i being used as grounds for his dismissal from trinity college at cambridge this incident fused two of his most controversial causes as he had failed to be granted fellow status which would have protected him from firing because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout christian or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic he later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression citing the incident in free thought and official propaganda where he explained that the expression of any idea even the most obviously bad must be protected not only from direct state intervention but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced the opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them but this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the inquisition 91 178 93 russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the vietnam war the 1955 russell einstein manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time 91 179 93 in 1966 1967 russell worked with jean paul sartre and many other intellectual figures to form the russell vietnam war crimes tribunal to investigate the conduct of the united states in vietnam he wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period early in his life russell supported eugenicist policies he proposed in 1894 that the state issue certificates of health to prospective parents and withhold public benefits from those considered unfit 91 180 93 in 1929 he wrote that people deemed mentally defective and feebleminded should be sexually sterilized because they are apt to have enormous numbers of illegitimate children all as a rule wholly useless to the community 91 181 93 russell was also an advocate of population control 91 182 93 91 183 93 the nations which at present increase rapidly should be encouraged to adopt the methods by which in the west the increase of population has been checked educational propaganda with government help could achieve this result in a generation there are however two powerful forces opposed to such a policy one is religion the other is nationalism i think it is the duty of all to proclaim that opposition to the spread of birth is appalling depth of misery and degradation and that within another fifty years or so i do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing there are others which one must suppose opponents of birth control would prefer war as i remarked a moment ago has hitherto been disappointing in this respect but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective if a black death could be spread throughout the whole world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full on 20 november 1948 in a public speech at westminster school addressing a gathering arranged by the new commonwealth russell shocked some observers by suggesting that a preemptive nuclear strike on the soviet union was justified russell argued that war between the united states and the soviet union seemed inevitable so it would be a humanitarian gesture to get it over with quickly and have the united states in the dominant position currently russell argued humanity could survive such a war whereas a full nuclear war after both sides had manufactured large stockpiles of more destructive weapons was likely to result in the extinction of the human race russell later relented from this stance instead arguing for mutual disarmament by the nuclear powers in 1956 immediately before and during the suez crisis russell expressed his opposition to european imperialism in the middle east he viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the suez canal area where general interest is involved at the same time the suez crisis was taking place the world was also captivated by the hungarian revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening soviet forces russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the suez war while ignoring soviet repression in hungary to which he responded that he did not criticise the soviets because there was no need most of the so called western world was fulminating although he later feigned a lack of concern at the time he was disgusted by the brutal soviet response and on 16 november 1956 he expressed approval for a declaration of support for hungarian scholars which michael polanyi had cabled to the soviet embassy in london twelve days previously shortly after soviet troops had entered budapest 91 184 93 in november 1957 russell wrote an article addressing us president dwight d eisenhower and soviet premier nikita khrushchev urging a summit to consider the conditions of co existence khrushchev responded that peace could be served by such a meeting in january 1958 russell elaborated his views in the observer proposing a cessation of all nuclear weapons production with the uk taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear weapons program if necessary and with germany freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between east and west us secretary of state john foster dulles replied for eisenhower the exchange of letters was published as the vital letters of russell khrushchev and dulles 91 185 93 russell was asked by the new republic a liberal american magazine to elaborate his views on world peace he urged that all nuclear weapons testing and flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all hydrogen bombs with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power he proposed that germany be reunified and accept the oder neisse line as its border and that a neutral zone be established in central europe consisting at the minimum of germany poland hungary and czechoslovakia with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone in the middle east russell suggested that the west avoid opposing arab nationalism and proposed the creation of a united nations peacekeeping force to guard israel s frontiers to ensure that israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it he also suggested western recognition of the people s republic of china and that it be admitted to the un with a permanent seat on the un security council 91 185 93 he was in contact with lionel rogosin while the latter was filming his anti war film good times wonderful times in the 1960s he became a hero to many of the youthful members of the new left in early 1963 russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the vietnam war and felt that the us government s policies there were near genocidal in 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the jerusalem prize an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society 91 186 93 in 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to israel and the arab countries to accept an arms embargo and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry 91 187 93 in october 1965 he tore up his labour party card because he suspected harold wilson s labour government was going to send troops to support the united states in vietnam 91 76 93 final years death and legacy edit plas penrhyn in penrhyndeudraeth russell on a

on 31 january 1970 russell issued a statement condemning israel s aggression in the middle east and in particular israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in egyptian territory as part of the war of attrition which he compared to german bombing raids in the battle of britain and the us bombing of vietnam he called for an israeli withdrawal to the pre six day war borders this was russell s

russell einstein manifesto russell tribunal russell s teapot theory of descriptions logical atomism vte see also bertrand russell s political views philosophy edit main article bertrand russell s philosophical views russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy he was deeply impressed by gottfried leibniz 1646 1716 and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics he was particularly prolific in the fields of metaphysics logic and the philosophy of mathematics the philosophy of language ethics and epistemology when brand blanshard asked russell why he did not write on aesthetics russell replied that he did not know anything about it though he hastened to add but that is not a very good excuse for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects 91 205 93 on ethics russell wrote that he was a utilitarian in his youth yet he later distanced himself from this view 91 206 93 for the advancement of science and protection of liberty of expression russell advocated the will to doubt the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess that one should always remember none of our beliefs are quite true all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error the methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known they consist in hearing all sides trying to ascertain all the relevant facts controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate these methods are practised in science and have built up the body of scientific knowledge every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery nevertheless it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes though not for all in science where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found men s attitude is tentative and full of doubt 91 178 93 religion edit russell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic or an atheist he found it difficult to determine which term to adopt saying therefore in regard to the olympic gods speaking to a purely philosophical audience i would say that i am an agnostic but speaking popularly i think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were atheists in regard to the christian god i should i think take exactly the same line 91 207 93 for most of his adult life russell maintained religion to be little more than superstition and despite any positive effects largely harmful to people he believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency and to be responsible for much of our world s wars oppression and misery he was a member of the advisory council of the british humanist association and president of cardiff humanists until his death 91 208 93 society edit main article bertrand russell s political views political and social activism occupied much of russell s time for most of his life russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes russell argued for a scientific society where war would be abolished population growth would be limited and prosperity would be shared 91 209 93 he suggested the establishment of a single supreme world government able to enforce peace 91 210 93 claiming that the only thing that will redeem mankind is co operation 91 211 93 russell also expressed support for guild socialism and commented positively on several socialist thinkers and activists 91 212 93 russell was an active supporter of the homosexual law reform society being one of the signatories of a e dyson s 1958 letter to the times calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices which were partly legalised in 1967 when russell was still alive 91 213 93 russell advocated and was one of the first people in the uk to suggest 91 214 93 a universal basic income 91 215 93 in reflections on my eightieth birthday postscript in his autobiography russell wrote i have lived in the pursuit of a vision both personal and social personal to care for what is noble for what is beautiful for what is gentle to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times social to see in imagination the society that is to be created where individuals grow freely and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them these things i believe and the world for all its horrors has left me unshaken 91 216 93 freedom of opinion and expression edit russell was a champion of freedom of opinion and an opponent of both censorship and indoctrination in 1928 he wrote the fundamental argument for freedom of opinion is the doubtfulness of all our belief when the state intervenes to ensure the indoctrination of some doctrine it does so because there is no conclusive evidence in favour of that doctrine it is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions make it impossible to make a living 91 217 93 in 1957 he wrote free thought means thinking freely to be worthy of the name freethinker he must be free of two things the force of tradition and the tyranny of his own passions 91 218 93 education edit russell has presented ideas on the possible means of control of education in case of scientific dictatorship governments of the kind of this excerpt taken from chapter ii general effects of scientific technique of the impact of science on society 91 219 93 this subject will make great strides when it is taken up by scientists under a scientific dictatorship anaxagoras maintained that snow is black but no one believed him the social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black various results will soon be arrived at first that the influence of home is obstructive second that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten third that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective fourth that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity but i anticipate it is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark grey although this science will be diligently studied it will be rigidly confined to the governing class the populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated when the technique has been perfected every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen as yet there is only one country which has succeeded in creating this politician s paradise the social effects of scientific technique have already been many and important and are likely to be even more noteworthy in the future some of these effects depend upon the political and economic character of the country concerned others are inevitable whatever this character may be he pushed his visionary scenarios even further into details in the chapter iii scientific technique in an oligarchy of the same book 91 220 93 stating as an example in future such failures are not likely to occur where there is dictatorship diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible even if all are miserable all will believe themselves happy because the government will tell them that they are so selected bibliography edit below is a selected bibliography of russell s books in english sorted by year of first publication 1896 german social democracy london

who thought otherwise belief in happiness i found was called utilitarianism and was merely one among a number of ethical theories i adhered to it after this discovery and was rash enough to tell my grandmother that i was a utilitarian in a letter from 1902 in which russell criticized utilitarianism he wrote i may as well begin by confessing that for many years it seemed to me perfectly self evident that pleasure is the only good and pain the only evil now however the opposite seems to me self evident this change has been brought about by what i may call moral experience ibid p 161
