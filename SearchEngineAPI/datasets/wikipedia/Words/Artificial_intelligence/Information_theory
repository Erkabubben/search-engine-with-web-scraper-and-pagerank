theorem vte information theory is the scientific study of the quantification storage and communication of information 91 1 93 the field was originally established by the works of harry nyquist and ralph hartley in the 1920s and claude shannon in the 1940s 91 2 93 58 8202 vii 8202 the field is at the intersection of probability theory statistics computer science statistical mechanics information engineering and electrical engineering a key measure in information theory is entropy entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process for example identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip with two equally likely outcomes provides less information lower entropy than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die with six equally likely outcomes some other important measures in information theory are mutual information channel capacity error exponents and relative entropy important sub fields of information theory

articles 8 3 textbooks on information theory 8 4 other books 9 external links overview edit information theory studies the transmission processing extraction and utilization of information abstractly information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty in the case of communication of information over a noisy channel this abstract concept was formalized in 1948 by claude shannon in a paper entitled a mathematical theory of communication in which information is thought of as a set of possible messages and the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel and to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error in spite of the channel noise shannon s main result the noisy channel coding theorem showed that in the limit of many channel uses the rate of information that is asymptotically achievable is equal to the channel capacity a quantity dependent merely on the statistics of the channel over which the messages are sent 91 4 93 coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods called codes for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the channel capacity these codes can be roughly subdivided into data compression source coding and error correction channel coding techniques in the latter case it took many years to find the methods shannon s work proved were possible a third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms both codes and ciphers concepts methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in cryptography and cryptanalysis see the article ban unit for a historical application historical background edit main article history of information theory the landmark event establishing the discipline of information theory and bringing it to immediate worldwide attention was the publication of claude e shannon s classic paper a mathematical theory of communication in the bell system technical journal in july and october 1948 prior to this paper limited information theoretic ideas had been developed at bell labs all implicitly assuming events of equal probability harry nyquist s 1924 paper certain factors affecting telegraph speed contains a theoretical section quantifying intelligence and the line speed at which it can be transmitted by a communication system giving the relation w k log m recalling the boltzmann constant where w is the speed of transmission of intelligence m is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step and k is a constant ralph hartley s 1928 paper transmission of information uses the word information as a measurable quantity reflecting the receiver s ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other thus quantifying information as h log sn n log s where s was the number of possible symbols and n the number of symbols in a transmission the unit of information was therefore the decimal digit which since has sometimes been called the hartley in his honor as a unit or scale or measure of information alan turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the german second world war enigma ciphers much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of thermodynamics by ludwig boltzmann and j willard gibbs connections between information theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy including the important contributions by rolf landauer in the 1960s are explored in entropy in thermodynamics and information theory in shannon s revolutionary and groundbreaking paper the work for which had been substantially completed at bell labs by the end of 1944 shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory opening with the assertion the fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point with it came the ideas of the information entropy and redundancy of a source and its relevance through the source coding theorem the mutual information and the channel capacity of a noisy channel including the promise of perfect loss free communication given by the noisy channel coding theorem the practical result of the shannon hartley law for the channel capacity of a gaussian channel as well as the bit a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information quantities of information edit main article quantities of information information theory is based on probability theory and statistics where quantified information is usually described in terms of bits information theory often concerns itself with measures of information of the distributions associated with random variables one of the most important measures is called entropy which forms the building block of many other measures entropy allows quantification of measure of information in a single random variable another useful concept is mutual information defined on two random variables which describes the measure of information in common between those variables which can be used to describe their correlation the former quantity is a property of the probability distribution of a random variable and gives a limit on the rate at which data generated by independent samples with the given distribution can be reliably compressed the latter is a property of the joint distribution of two random variables and is the maximum rate of reliable communication across a noisy channel in the limit of long block lengths when the channel statistics are determined by the joint distribution the choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the unit of information entropy that is used a common unit of information is the bit based on the binary logarithm other units include the nat which is based on the natural logarithm and the decimal digit which is based on the common logarithm in what follows an expression of the form p log p is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever p 0 this is justified because lim p x2192 0 p log x2061 p 0 displaystyle lim p rightarrow 0 p log p 0 for any logarithmic base entropy of an information source edit based on the probability mass function of each source symbol to be communicated the shannon entropy h in units of bits per symbol is given by h x2212 x2211 i p i log 2 x2061 p i displaystyle h sum i p i log 2 p i where pi is the probability of occurrence of the i th possible value of the source symbol this equation gives the entropy in the units of bits per symbol because it uses a logarithm of base 2 and this base 2 measure of entropy has sometimes been called the shannon in his honor entropy is also commonly computed using the natural logarithm base e where e is euler s number which produces a measurement of entropy in nats per symbol and sometimes simplifies the analysis by avoiding the need to include extra constants in the formulas other bases are also possible but less commonly used for example a logarithm of base 28 256 will produce a measurement in bytes per symbol and a logarithm of base 10 will produce a measurement in decimal digits or hartleys per symbol intuitively the entropy hx of a discrete random variable x is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the value of x when only its distribution is known the entropy of a source that emits a sequence of n symbols that are independent and identically distributed iid is n h bits per message of n symbols if the source data symbols are identically distributed but not independent the entropy of a message of length n will be less than n h the entropy of a bernoulli trial as a function of success probability often called the binary entropy function hb p the entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable as in an unbiased coin toss if one transmits 1000 bits 0s and 1s and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver has a specific value with certainty ahead of transmission it is clear that no information is transmitted if however each bit is independently equally likely to be 0 or 1 1000 shannons of information more often called bits have been transmitted between these two extremes information can be quantified as follows if x displaystyle mathbb x is the set of all messages x1 xn that x could be and p x is the probability of some x x2208 x displaystyle x in mathbb x then the entropy h of x is defined 91 12 93 h x e x i x x2212 x2211 x x2208 x p x log x2061 p x displaystyle h x mathbb e x i x sum x in mathbb x p x log p x here i x is the self information which is the entropy contribution of an individual message and e x displaystyle mathbb e x is the expected value a property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable p x 1 n i e most unpredictable in which case h x log n the special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the binary entropy function usually taken to the logarithmic base 2 thus having the shannon sh as unit h b p x2212 p log 2 x2061 p x2212 1 x2212 p log 2 x2061 1 x2212 p displaystyle h mathrm b p p log 2 p 1 p log 2 1 p joint entropy edit the joint entropy of two discrete random variables x and y is merely the entropy of their pairing x y this implies that if x and y are independent then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies for example if x y represents the position of a chess piece x the row and y the column then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece h x y e x y x2212 log x2061 p x y x2212 x2211 x y p x y log x2061 p x y displaystyle h x y mathbb e x y log p x y sum x y p x y log p x y despite similar notation joint entropy should not be confused with cross entropy conditional entropy equivocation edit the conditional entropy or conditional uncertainty of x given random variable y also called the equivocation of x about y is the average conditional entropy over y 91 13 93 h x y e y h x y x2212 x2211 y x2208 y p y x2211 x x2208 x p x y log x2061 p x y x2212 x2211 x y p x y log x2061 p x y displaystyle h x y mathbb e y h x y sum y in y p y sum x in x p x y log p x y sum x y p x y log p x y because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy the former of which is in more common use a basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that h x y h x y x2212 h y displaystyle h x y h x y h y mutual information transinformation edit mutual information measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another it is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals the mutual information of x relative to y is given by i x y e x y s i x y x2211 x y p x y log x2061 p x y p x p y displaystyle i x y mathbb e x y si x y sum x y p x y log frac p x y p x p y where si specific mutual information is the pointwise mutual information a basic property of the mutual information is that i x y h x x2212 h x y displaystyle i x y h x h x y that is knowing y we can save an average of i x y bits in encoding x compared to not knowing y mutual information is symmetric i x y i y x h x h y x2212 h x y displaystyle i x y i y x h x h y h x y mutual information can be expressed as the average kullback leibler divergence information gain between the posterior probability distribution of x given the value of y and the prior distribution on x i x y e p y d k l p x y y x2016 p x displaystyle i x y mathbb e p y d mathrm kl p x y y p x in other words this is a measure of how much on the average the probability distribution on x will change if we are given the value of y this is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution i x y d k l p x y x2016 p x p y displaystyle i x y d mathrm kl p x y p x p y mutual information is closely related to the log likelihood ratio test in the context of contingency tables and the multinomial distribution and to pearson s 2 test mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables and has a well specified asymptotic distribution kullback leibler divergence information gain edit the kullback leibler divergence or information divergence information gain or relative entropy is a way of comparing two distributions a true probability distribution p x displaystyle p x and an arbitrary probability distribution q x displaystyle q x if we compress data in a manner that assumes q x displaystyle q x is the distribution underlying some data when in reality p x displaystyle p x is the correct distribution the kullback leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression it is thus defined d k l p x x2016 q x x2211 x x2208 x x2212 p x log x2061 q x x2212 x2211 x x2208 x x2212 p x log x2061 p x x2211 x x2208 x p x log x2061 p x q x displaystyle d mathrm kl p x q x sum x in x p x log q x sum x in x p x log p x sum x in x p x log frac p x q x although it is sometimes used as a distance metric kl divergence is not a true metric since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality making it a semi quasimetric another interpretation of the kl divergence is the unnecessary surprise introduced by a prior from the truth suppose a number x is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution p x displaystyle p x if alice knows the true distribution p x displaystyle p x while bob believes has a prior that the distribution is q x displaystyle q x then bob will be more surprised than alice on average upon seeing the value of x the kl divergence is the objective expected value of bob s subjective surprisal minus alice s surprisal measured in bits if the log is in base 2 in this way the extent to which bob s prior is wrong can be quantified in terms of how unnecessarily surprised it is expected to make him directed information edit directed information i x n x2192 y n displaystyle i x n to y n is an information theory measure that quantifies the information flow from the random process x n x 1 x 2 x2026 x n displaystyle x n x 1 x 2 dots x n to the random process y n y 1 y 2 x2026 y n displaystyle y n y 1 y 2 dots y n the term directed information was coined by james massey and is defined as i x n x2192 y n x225c x2211 i 1 n i x i y i y i x2212 1 displaystyle i x n to y n triangleq sum i 1 n i x i y i y i 1 where i x i y i y i x2212 1 displaystyle i x i y i y i 1 is the conditional mutual information i x 1 x 2 x i y i y 1 y 2 y i x2212 1 displaystyle i x 1 x 2 x i y i y 1 y 2 y i 1 differently from the mutual informaion the dircted information is not symmetric the i x n x2192 y n displaystyle i x n to y n measures the information bits that are transmitted caussaly from x n displaystyle x n to y n displaystyle y n the directed information has many applications in problems where causality plays an important role such as capacity of channel with feedback 91 14 93 91 15 93 capacity of discrete memoryless networks with feedback 91 16 93 gambling with causal side information 91 17 93 compression with causal side information 91 18 93 and in real time control communication settings 91 19 93 91 20 93 statistical physics 91 21 93 other quantities edit other important information theoretic quantities include r nyi entropy a generalization of entropy differential entropy a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions and the conditional mutual information coding theory edit main article coding theory a picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a cd r music and data cds are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using error detection and correction coding theory is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory it can be subdivided into source coding theory and channel coding theory using a statistical description for data information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data which is the information entropy of the source data compression source coding there are two formulations for the compression problem lossless data compression the data must be reconstructed exactly lossy data compression allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function this subset of information theory is called rate distortion theory error correcting codes channel coding while data compression removes as much redundancy as possible an error correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy i e error correction needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel this division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems or source channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts however these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user in scenarios with more than one transmitter the multiple access channel more than one receiver the broadcast channel or intermediary helpers the relay channel or more general networks compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal source theory edit any process that generates successive messages can be considered a source of information a memoryless source is one in which each message is an independent identically distributed random variable whereas the properties of ergodicity and stationarity impose less restrictive constraints all such sources are stochastic these terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory rate edit information rate is the average entropy per symbol for memoryless sources this is merely the entropy of each symbol while in the case of a stationary stochastic process it is r lim n x2192 x221e h x n x n x2212 1 x n x2212 2 x n x2212 3 x2026 displaystyle r lim n to infty h x n x n 1 x n 2 x n 3 ldots that is the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated for the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary the average rate is r lim n x2192 x221e 1 n h x 1 x 2 x2026 x n displaystyle r lim n to infty frac 1 n h x 1 x 2 dots x n that is the limit of the joint entropy per symbol for stationary sources these two expressions give the same result 91 22 93 information rate is defined as r lim n x2192 x221e 1 n i x 1 x 2 x2026 x n y 1 y 2 x2026 y n displaystyle r lim n to infty frac 1 n i x 1 x 2 dots x n y 1 y 2 dots y n it is common in information theory to speak of the rate or entropy of a language this is appropriate for example when the source of information is english prose the rate of a source of information is related to its redundancy and how well it can be compressed the subject of source coding channel capacity edit main article channel capacity communications over a channel is the primary motivation of information theory however channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal noise periods of silence and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality consider the communications process over a discrete channel a simple model of the process is shown below x2192 message w encoder f n x2192 e n c o d e d s e q u e n c e x n channel p y x x2192 r e c e i v e d s e q u e n c e y n decoder

represents the space of messages transmitted and y the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel let p y 124 x be the conditional probability distribution function of y given x we will consider p y 124 x to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel representing the nature of the noise of our channel then the joint distribution of x and y is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of f x the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel under these constraints we would like to maximize the rate of information or the signal we can communicate over the channel the appropriate measure for this is the mutual information and this maximum mutual information is called the channel capacity and is given by c max f i x y displaystyle c max f i x y this capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate r where r is usually bits per symbol for any information rate r lt c and coding error gt 0 for large enough n there exists a code of length n and rate r and a decoding algorithm such that the maximal probability of block error is that is it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error in addition for any rate r gt c it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error channel coding is concerned with finding such nearly optimal codes that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity capacity of particular channel models edit a continuous time analog communications channel subject to gaussian noise see shannon hartley theorem a binary symmetric channel bsc with crossover probability p is a binary input binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability p the bsc has a capacity of 1 8722 hb p bits per channel use where hb is the binary entropy function to the base 2 logarithm a binary erasure channel bec with erasure probability p is a binary input ternary output channel the possible channel outputs are 0 1 and a third symbol e called an erasure the erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit the capacity of the bec is 1 8722 p bits per channel use channels with memory and directed information edit in practice many channels have memory namely at time i displaystyle i the channel is given by the conditional probability p y i x i x i x2212 1 x i x2212 2 x 1 y i x2212 1 y i x2212 2 y 1 displaystyle p y i x i x i 1 x i 2 x 1 y i 1 y i 2 y 1 it is often more comfortable to use the notation x i x i x i x2212 1 x i x2212 2 x 1 displaystyle x i x i x i 1 x i 2 x 1 and the channel become p y i x i y i x2212 1 displaystyle p y i x i y i 1 in such a case the capacity is given by the mutual information rate when there is no feedback available and the directed information rate in the case that either there is feedback or not 91 23 93 91 24 93 if there is no feedback the directed information equals the mutual information applications to other fields edit intelligence uses and secrecy applications edit information theoretic concepts apply to cryptography and cryptanalysis turing s information unit the ban was used in the ultra project breaking the german enigma machine code and hastening the end of world war ii in europe shannon himself defined an important concept now called the unicity distance based on the redundancy of the plaintext it attempts to give a minimum amount of ciphertext necessary to ensure unique decipherability information theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear a brute force attack can break systems based on asymmetric key algorithms or on most commonly used methods of symmetric key algorithms sometimes called secret key algorithms such as block ciphers the security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time information theoretic security refers to methods such as the one time pad that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks in such cases the positive conditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext conditioned on the key can ensure proper transmission while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero resulting in absolutely secure communications in other words an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key however as in any other cryptographic system care must be used to correctly apply even information theoretically secure methods the venona project was able to crack the one time pads of the soviet union due to their improper reuse of key material pseudorandom number generation edit pseudorandom number generators are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs they are almost universally unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software a class of improved random number generators is termed cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators but even they require random seeds external to the software to work as intended these can be obtained via extractors if done carefully the measure of sufficient randomness in extractors is min entropy a value related to shannon entropy through r nyi entropy r nyi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems although related the distinctions among these measures mean that a random variable with high shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses seismic exploration edit one early commercial application of information theory was in the field of seismic oil exploration work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal information theory and digital signal processing offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods 91 25 93 semiotics edit semioticians doede nauta and winfried n th both considered charles sanders peirce as having created a theory of information in his works on semiotics 91 26 93 58 8202 171 8202 91 27 93 58 8202 137 8202 nauta defined semiotic information theory as the study of the internal processes of coding filtering and information processing 91 26 93 58 8202 91 8202 concepts from information theory such as redundancy and code control have been used by semioticians such as umberto eco and ferruccio rossi landi to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only one message is decoded among a selection of competing ones 91 28 93 integrated process organization of neural information edit quantitative information theoretic methods have been applied in cognitive science to analyze the integrated process organization of neural information in the context of the binding problem in cognitive neuroscience 91 29 93 in this context either an information theoretical measure such as functional clusters gerald edelman and giulio tononi s functional clustering model and dynamic core hypothesis
