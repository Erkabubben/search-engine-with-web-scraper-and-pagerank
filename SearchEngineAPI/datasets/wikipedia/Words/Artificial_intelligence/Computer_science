computing 91 14 93 ada lovelace published the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer 91 15 93 the earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity aiding in computations such as multiplication and division algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment 91 16 93 wilhelm schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623 91 17 93 in 1673 gottfried leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator called the stepped reckoner 91 18 93 leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist because of various reasons including the fact that he documented the binary number system in 1820 thomas de colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry 91 note 1 93 when he invented his simplified arithmometer the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment charles babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator his difference engine in 1822 which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator his analytical engine 91 19 93 he started developing this machine in 1834 and in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer 91 20 93 a crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the jacquard loom 91 20 93 making it infinitely programmable 91 note 2 93 in 1843 during the translation of a french article on the analytical engine ada lovelace wrote in one of the many notes she included an algorithm to compute the bernoulli numbers which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer 91 21 93 around 1885 herman hollerith invented the tabulator which used punched cards to process statistical information eventually his company became part of ibm following babbage although unaware of his earlier work percy ludgate in 1909 published 91 22 93 the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history in 1937 one hundred years after babbage s impossible dream howard aiken convinced ibm which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business 91 23 93 to develop his giant programmable calculator the ascc harvard mark i based on babbage s analytical engine which itself used cards and a central computing unit when the machine was finished some hailed it as babbage s dream come true 91 24 93 during the 1940s with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the atanasoff berry computer and eniac the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors 91 25 93 as it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general in 1945 ibm founded the watson scientific computing laboratory at columbia university in new york city the renovated fraternity house on manhattan s west side was ibm s first laboratory devoted to pure science the lab is the forerunner of ibm s research division which today operates research facilities around the world 91 26 93 ultimately the close relationship between ibm and columbia university was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline with columbia offering one of the first academic credit courses in computer science in 1946 91 27 93 computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s 91 28 93 91 29 93 the world s first computer science degree program the cambridge diploma in computer science began at the university of cambridge computer laboratory in 1953 the first computer science department in the united states was formed at purdue university in 1962 91 30 93 since practical computers became available many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights see also history of computing and history of informatics etymology see also informatics 160 etymology although first proposed in 1956 91 31 93 the term computer science appears in a 1959 article in communications of the acm 91 32 93 in which louis fein argues for the creation of a graduate school in computer sciences analogous to the creation of harvard business school in 1921 91 33 93 louis justifies the name by arguing that like management science the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline 91 32 93 his efforts and those of others such as numerical analyst george forsythe were rewarded universities went on to create such departments starting with purdue in 1962 91 34 93 despite its name a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves because of this several alternative names have been proposed 91 35 93 certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science to emphasize precisely that difference danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy 91 36 93 to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment while not necessarily involving computers the first scientific institution to use the term was the department of datalogy at the university of copenhagen founded in 1969 with peter naur being the first professor in datalogy the term is used mainly in the scandinavian countries an alternative term also proposed by naur is data science this is now used for a multi disciplinary field of data analysis including statistics and databases in the early days of computing a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the communications of the acm turingineer turologist flow charts man applied meta mathematician and applied epistemologist 91 37 93 three months later in the same journal comptologist was suggested followed next year by hypologist 91 38 93 the term computics has also been suggested 91 39 93 in europe terms derived from contracted translations of the expression automatic information e g informazione automatica in italian or information and mathematics are often used e g informatique french informatik german informatica italian dutch inform tica spanish portuguese informatika slavic languages and hungarian or pliroforiki which means informatics in greek similar words have also been adopted in the uk as in the school of informatics university of edinburgh 91 40 93 in the u s however informatics is linked with applied computing or computing in the context of another domain 91 41 93 a folkloric quotation often attributed to but almost certainly not first formulated by edsger dijkstra states that computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes 91 note 3 93 the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science for example the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems however there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer related disciplines computer science research also often intersects other disciplines such as cognitive science linguistics mathematics physics biology earth science statistics philosophy and logic computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science 91 28 93 early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as kurt g del alan turing john von neumann r zsa p ter and alonzo church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic category theory domain theory and algebra 91 31 93 the relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue which is further muddied by disputes over what the term software engineering means and how computer science is defined 91 42 93 david parnas taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals making the two separate but complementary disciplines 91 43 93 the academic political and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research philosophy main article philosophy of computer science epistemology of computer science despite the word science in its name there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science 91 44 93 mathematics 91 45 93 or engineering 91 46 93 allen newell and herbert a simon argued in 1975 computer science is an empirical discipline we would have called it an experimental science but like astronomy economics and geology some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method nonetheless they are experiments each new machine that is built is an experiment actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available 91 46 93 it has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of programs but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science if any exist and defining the nature of experiments in computer science 91 46 93 proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering 91 46 93 they also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena 91 46 93 proponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods 91 46 93 computer scientists edsger w dijkstra and tony hoare regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical axiomatic systems 91 46 93 paradigms of computer science a number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science peter wegner argued that those paradigms are science technology and mathematics 91 47 93 peter denning s working group argued that they are theory abstraction modeling and design 91 48 93 amnon h eden described them as the rationalist paradigm which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics which is prevalent in theoretical computer science and mainly employs deductive reasoning the technocratic paradigm which might be found in engineering approaches most prominently in software engineering and the scientific paradigm which approaches computer related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences 91 49 93 identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence 91 50 93 computer science focuses on methods involved in design specification programming verification implementation and testing of human made computing systems 91 51 93 fields computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes 8201 edsger dijkstra further information outline of computer science as a discipline computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software 91 52 93 91 53 93 csab formerly called computing sciences accreditation board which is made up of representatives of the association for computing machinery acm and the ieee computer society ieee cs 91 54 93 identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science theory of computation algorithms and data structures programming methodology and languages and computer elements and architecture in addition to these four areas csab also identifies fields such as software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking and communication database systems parallel computation distributed computation human computer interaction computer graphics operating systems and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science 91 52 93 theoretical computer science main article theoretical computer science theoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit but it derives its motivation from the practical and everyday computation its aim is to understand the nature of computation and as a consequence of this understanding provide more efficient methodologies theory of computation main article theory of computation according to peter denning the fundamental question underlying computer science is what can be automated 91 28 93 theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations in an effort to answer the first question computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation the second question is addressed by computational complexity theory which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems the famous p np problem one of the millennium prize problems 91 55 93 is an open problem in the theory of computation m x x x2209 x displaystyle m x x not in x automata theory formal languages computability theory computational complexity theory models of computation quantum computing theory logic circuit theory cellular automata information and coding theory main articles information theory and coding theory information theory closely related to probability and statistics is related to the quantification of information this was developed by claude shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data 91 56 93 coding theory is the study of the properties of codes systems for converting information from one form to another and their fitness for a specific application codes are used for data compression cryptography error detection and correction and more recently also for network coding codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods 91 57 93 coding theory channel capacity algorithmic information theory signal detection theory kolmogorov complexity data structures and algorithms main articles data structure and algorithmdata structures and algorithms are the studies of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency o n2 analysis of algorithms algorithm design data structures combinatorial optimization computational geometry randomized algorithms programming language theory and formal methods main articles programming language theory and formal methods programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design implementation analysis characterization and classification of programming languages and their individual features it falls within the discipline of computer science both depending on and affecting mathematics software engineering and linguistics it is an active research area with numerous dedicated academic journals formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification development and verification of software and hardware systems 91 58 93 the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that as in other engineering disciplines performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design they form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering especially where safety or security is involved formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing for industrial use tool support is required however the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high integrity and life critical systems where safety or security is of utmost importance formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals in particular logic calculi formal languages automata theory and program semantics but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification

technical debt and software development processes artificial intelligence main articles artificial intelligence and bio inspired computing artificial intelligence ai aims to or is required to synthesize goal orientated processes such as problem solving decision making environmental adaptation learning and communication found in humans and animals from its origins in cybernetics and in the dartmouth conference 1956 artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross disciplinary drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics symbolic logic semiotics electrical engineering philosophy of mind neurophysiology and social intelligence ai is associated in the popular mind with robotic development but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development which require computational understanding the starting point in the late 1940s was alan turing s question can computers think and the question remains effectively unanswered although the turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence but the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real world data computational learning theory computer vision neural networks planning and scheduling natural language processing computational game theory evolutionary computation autonomic computing representation and reasoning pattern recognition robotics swarm intelligence computer systems computer architecture and organization main articles computer architecture computer organisation and computer engineering computer architecture or digital computer organization is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system it focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory 91 61 93 computer engineers study computational logic and design of computer hardware from individual processor components microcontrollers personal computers to supercomputers and embedded systems the term architecture in computer literature can be traced to the work of lyle r johnson and frederick p brooks jr members of the machine organization department in ibm s main research center in 1959 processing unit microarchitecture multiprocessing processor design ubiquitous computing systems architecture operating systems input output embedded system real time computing dependability interpreter concurrent parallel and distributed computing main articles concurrency computer science and distributed computing concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously and potentially interacting with each other 91 62 93 a number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including petri nets process calculi and the parallel random access machine model 91 63 93 when multiple computers are connected in a network while using concurrency this is known as a distributed system computers within that distributed system have their own private memory and information can be exchanged to achieve common goals 91 64 93 computer networks main article computer network this branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide computer security and cryptography main articles computer security and cryptography computer security is a branch of computer technology with the objective of protecting information from unauthorized access disruption or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users historical cryptography

modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric encryption digital signatures cryptographic hash functions key agreement protocols blockchain zero knowledge proofs and garbled circuits databases and data mining main articles database and data mining a database is intended to organize store and retrieve large amounts of data easily digital databases are managed using database management systems to store create maintain and search data through database models and query languages data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets discoveries the philosopher of computing bill rapaport noted three great insights of computer science 91 66 93 gottfried wilhelm leibniz s george boole s alan turing s claude shannon s and samuel morse s insight there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent anything 91 note 4 93 all the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 or any other bistable pair that can flip flop between two easily distinguishable states such as on off magnetized de magnetized high voltage low voltage etc see also digital physics alan turing s insight there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do anything every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions 91 67 93 move left one location move right one location read symbol at current location print 0 at current location print 1 at current location see also turing machine corrado b hm and giuseppe jacopini s insight there are only three ways of combining these actions into more complex ones that are needed in order for a computer to do anything 91 68 93 only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones sequence first do this then do that selection if such and such is the case then do this else do that repetition while such and such is the case do this note that the three rules of boehm s and jacopini s insight can be further simplified with the use of goto which means it is more elementary than structured programming see also structured program theorem programming paradigms main article programming paradigm programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways common programming paradigms include functional programming a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data it is a declarative programming paradigm which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements 91 69 93 imperative programming a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program s state 91 70 93 in much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates object oriented programming a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which may contain data in the form of fields often known as attributes and code in the form of procedures often known as methods a feature of objects is that an object s procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated thus object oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another 91 71 93 service oriented programming a programming paradigm that uses services as the unit of computer work to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programs many languages offer support for multiple paradigms making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities 91 72 93 research further information list of computer science conferences and category computer science journals conferences are important events for computer science research during these conferences researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet unlike in most other academic fields in computer science the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications 91 73 93 91 74 93 one proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results a task better handled by conferences than by journals 91 75 93 education main article computer science education computer science known by its near synonyms computing computer studies has been taught in uk schools since the days of batch processing mark sensitive cards and paper tape but usually to a select few students 91 76 93 in 1981 the bbc produced a micro computer and classroom network and computer studies became common for gce o level students 11 16 year old and computer science to a level students its importance was recognised and it became a compulsory part of the national curriculum

cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums or because programs could now be of unlimited extent and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand it was important also because it served to crystallize babbage s feeling that he had invented something really new something much more than
