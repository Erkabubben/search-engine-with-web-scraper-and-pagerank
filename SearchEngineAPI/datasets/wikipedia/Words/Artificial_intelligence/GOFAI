gofai from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search this article is about differences between 1980s symbolic ai as described by the term gofai compared to a wider view progress since then and the current state of the art for a more detailed and complete overview of symbolic ai see symbolic artificial intelligence gofai is an acronym for good old fashioned artificial intelligence invented by the philosopher john haugeland in his 1985 book artificial intelligence the very idea 91 1 93 technically gofai refers only to a restricted kind of symbolic ai namely rule based or logical agents 91 2 93 this approach was popular in the 1980s especially as an approach to implementing expert systems but symbolic ai has since been extended in many ways to better handle uncertain reasoning and more open ended systems some of these extensions include probabilistic reasoning 91 2 93 non monotonic reasoning multi agent systems and neuro symbolic systems significant contributions of symbolic ai not encompassed by the gofai view include search algorithms automated planning and scheduling constraint based reasoning the semantic web ontologies knowledge graphs non monotonic logic circumscription automated theorem proving and symbolic mathematics for a more complete list see the main article on symbolic ai contents 1 symbolic ai after gofai and confusions caused

only gofai edit although the term gofai encompasses only a small part of symbolic ai prominent in the 1980s contemporary critics of symbolic ai sometimes use gofai as a synonym for it this conflation of terms can lead to conclusions that symbolic ai research ended in the 1980s and avoided machine learning since both conclusions are false and important to correct we address them below the 1980s gofai version of symbolic ai characterized by production rules and expert systems edit during the second ai summer i e the expert systems boom of the 1980s production rule systems requiring knowledge engineering were used to implement expert systems 91 3 93 knowledge engineering required working with subject matter experts to model task knowledge as rules at the time rules were hand authored by knowledge engineers or the subject matter experts gofai correctly describes this approach haugeland and dreyfus also correctly pointed out various limitations discussed in later sections the second ai winter occurred after the expert systems and lisp machines markets collapsed 91 4 93 expert systems did not handle uncertainty well required more resources to build and maintain than expected and proved brittle outside their intended domains due to a lack of common sense reasoning capabilities language specific lisp machines could become easily replaced by newer workstations with similar performance obviating their need symbolic ai after gofai edit symbolic ai continued albeit with reduced funding it redirected focus to address limitations in handling uncertainty using statistical ai and to speed knowledge acquisition with symbolic approaches to machine learning 91 5 93 work in semantic networks and knowledge representations led to formalizing ontologies with languages such as rdf and owl leading to large ontologies such as yago however the research and applications of symbolic ai since the second ai winter and outside of the production rule approach to expert systems are less well known and now eclipsed by the media focus on deep learning since 2012 for example research in symbolic ai machine learning includes decision tree learning mitchell s version space learning valiant s contributions to pac learning statistical relational learning inductive logic programming and various interactive learning approaches to incorporate user advice examples and explanations as an integral part of the learning process 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 problems when current symbolic ai is viewed as gofai edit using gofai as a synonym for current symbolic ai leads to erroneous conclusions and confusion garcez and lamb provide an example turing award winner judea pearl offers a critique of machine learning which unfortunately conflates the terms machine learning and deep learning similarly when geoffrey hinton refers to symbolic ai the connotation of the term tends to be that of expert systems dispossessed of any ability to learn the use of the terminology is in need of clarification machine learning is not confined to association rule mining c f the body of work on symbolic ml machine learning and relational learning the differences to deep learning being the choice of representation localist logical rather than distributed and the non use of gradient based learning algorithms equally symbolic ai is not just about production rules written by hand a proper definition of ai concerns knowledge representation and reasoning autonomous multi agent systems planning and argumentation as well as learning 91 9 93 the key points above are that symbolic ai research has long since moved beyond gofai research continues and gofai no longer describes it further there are symbolic learning approaches to machine learning such as inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning i e it is not just the domain of deep learning below we return to the philosophical critiques leveled against gofai the symbolic ai approach of the 1980s the gofai critique of rule based agents edit gofai the rule based approach of 1980s symbolic ai was attacked by philosophers such as hubert dreyfus his brother stuart dreyfus and philosopher kenneth sayre the essence of what they criticized was described earlier by computer scientist alan turing in his 1950 paper computing machinery and intelligence when he said that human behavior is far too complex to be captured by any formal set of rules humans must be using some informal guidelines that could never be captured in a formal set of rules and thus could never be codified in a computer program 91 10 93 turing called this the argument from informality of behaviour 91 11 93 russell and norvig describe the gofai critique in artificial intelligence a modern approach the position they criticize came to be called good old fashioned al or gofai a term coined by haugeland 1985 gofai is supposed to claim that all intelligent behavior can be captured by a system that reasons logically from a set of facts and rules describing the domain it therefore corresponds to the simplest logical agent described in chapter 7 dreyfus is correct in saying that logical agents are vulnerable to the qualification problem as we saw in chapter 13 probabilistic reasoning systems are more appropriate for open ended domains the dreyfus critique therefore is not addressed against computers per se but rather against one particular way of programming them it is reasonable to suppose however that a book called what first order logical rule based systems without learning can t do might have had less impact 91 12 93 in other words gofai restricts its view of agents to those controlled by logical rules in contrast to this view symbolic ai also includes non monotonic logic modal logic probabilistic logics multi agent systems symbolic machine learning and hybrid neuro symbolic architectures symbolic machine learning i e non connectionist machine learning specific to symbolic ai includes inductive logic programming statistical relational learning case based learning knowledge compilation chunking 91 13 93 macro operator learning 91 14 93 learning from analogy 91 15 93 and interactive learning from human advice 91 16 93 explanations 91 17 93 and exemplars 91 18 93 the gofai critique of disembodied agents edit russell and norvig do not reject all of dreyfus s arguments they accept his strongest argument one that applies to all disembodied ais whatever their approach one of dreyfus s strongest arguments is for situated agents rather than disembodied logical inference engines an agent whose understanding of dog comes only from a limited set of logical sentences such as dog x mammal x is at a disadvantage compared to an agent that has watched dogs run has played fetch with them and has been licked by one as philosopher andy clark 1998 says biological brains are first and foremost the control systems for biological bodies biological bodies move and act in rich real world surroundings according to clark we are good at frisbee bad at logic the embodied cognition approach claims that it makes no sense to consider the brain separately cognition takes place within a body which is embedded in an environment we need to study the system as a whole the brain s functioning exploits regularities in its environment including the rest of its body under the embodied cognition approach robotics vision and other sensors become central not peripheral 91 2 93 citations edit haugeland 1985 a b c russell amp norvig 2021 p 160 982 kautz 2022 pp 160 109 110 kautz 2022 p 160 110 kautz 2022
