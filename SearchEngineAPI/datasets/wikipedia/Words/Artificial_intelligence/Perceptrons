first implementation of the perceptron algorithm it was connected to a camera with 20 20 cadmium sulfide photocells to make a 400 pixel image the main visible feature is a patch panel that set different combinations of input features to the right arrays of potentiometers that implemented the adaptive weights 91 2 93 58 8202 213 8202 see also history of artificial intelligence 160 perceptrons and the attack on connectionism and ai winter 160 the abandonment of connectionism in 1969 the perceptron was invented in 1943 by mcculloch and pitts 91 3 93 the first implementation was a machine built in 1958 at the cornell aeronautical laboratory by frank rosenblatt 91 4 93 funded by the united states office of naval research 91 5 93 the perceptron was intended to be a machine rather than a program and while its first implementation was in software for the ibm 704 it was subsequently implemented in custom built hardware as the mark 1 perceptron this machine was designed for image recognition it had an array of 400 photocells randomly connected to the neurons weights were encoded in potentiometers and weight updates during learning were performed by electric motors 91 2 93 58 8202 193 8202 in a 1958 press conference organized by the us navy rosenblatt made statements about the perceptron that caused a heated controversy among the fledgling ai community based on rosenblatt s statements the new york times reported the perceptron to be the embryo of an electronic computer that the navy expects will be able to walk talk see write reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence 91 5 93 although the perceptron initially seemed promising it was quickly proved that perceptrons could not be trained to recognise many classes of patterns this caused the field of neural network research to stagnate for many years before it was recognised that a feedforward neural network with two or more layers also called a multilayer perceptron had greater processing power than perceptrons with one layer also called a single layer perceptron single layer perceptrons are only capable of learning linearly separable patterns for a classification task with some step activation function a single node will have a single line dividing the data points forming the patterns more nodes can create more dividing lines but those lines must somehow be combined to form more complex classifications a second layer of perceptrons or even linear nodes are sufficient to solve a lot of otherwise non separable problems in 1969 a famous book entitled perceptrons by marvin minsky and seymour papert showed that it was impossible for these classes of network to learn an xor function it is often believed incorrectly that they also conjectured that a similar result would hold for a multi layer perceptron network however this is not true as both minsky and papert already knew that multi layer perceptrons were capable of producing an xor function see the page on perceptrons book for more information nevertheless the often miscited minsky papert text caused a significant decline in interest and funding of neural network research it took ten more years until neural network research experienced a resurgence in the 1980s this text was reprinted in 1987 as perceptrons expanded edition where some errors in the original text are shown and corrected a 2022 article states that the mark 1 perceptron was part of a previously secret four year npic the us national photographic interpretation center effort from 1963 through 1966 to develop this algorithm into a useful tool for photo interpreters 91 6 93 the kernel perceptron algorithm was already introduced in 1964 by aizerman et al 91 7 93 margin bounds guarantees were given for the perceptron algorithm in the general non separable case first by freund and schapire 1998 91 1 93 and more recently by mohri and rostamizadeh 2013 who extend previous results and give new l1 bounds 91 8 93 the perceptron is a simplified model of a biological neuron while the complexity of biological neuron models is often required to fully understand neural behavior research suggests a perceptron like linear model can produce some behavior seen in real neurons 91 9 93 definition edit in the modern sense the perceptron is an algorithm for learning a binary classifier called a threshold function a function that maps its input x displaystyle mathbf x a real valued vector to an output value f x displaystyle f mathbf x a single binary value f x 1 if xa0 xa0 w x22c5 x b gt 0 0 otherwise displaystyle f mathbf x begin cases 1 amp text if mathbf w cdot mathbf x b gt 0 0 amp text otherwise end cases where w displaystyle mathbf w is a vector of real valued weights w x22c5 x displaystyle mathbf w cdot mathbf x is the dot product x2211 i 1 m w i x i displaystyle sum i 1 m w i x i where m is the number of inputs to the perceptron and b is the bias the bias shifts the decision boundary away from the origin and does not depend on any input value the value of f x displaystyle f mathbf x 0 or 1 is used to classify x displaystyle mathbf x as either a positive or a negative instance in the case of a binary classification problem if b is negative then the weighted combination of inputs must produce a positive value greater than b displaystyle b in order to push the classifier neuron over the 0 threshold spatially the bias alters the position though not the orientation of the decision boundary the perceptron learning algorithm does not terminate if the learning set is not linearly separable if the vectors are not linearly separable learning will never reach a point where all vectors are classified properly the most famous example of the perceptron s inability to solve problems with linearly nonseparable vectors is the boolean exclusive or problem the solution spaces of decision boundaries for all binary functions and learning behaviors are studied in the reference 91 10 93 in the context of neural networks a perceptron is an artificial neuron using the heaviside step function as the activation function the perceptron algorithm is also termed the single layer perceptron to distinguish it from a multilayer perceptron which is a misnomer for a more complicated neural network as a linear classifier the single layer perceptron is the simplest feedforward neural network learning algorithm edit below is an example of a learning algorithm for a single layer perceptron for multilayer perceptrons where a hidden layer exists more sophisticated algorithms such as backpropagation must be used if the activation function or the underlying process being modeled by the perceptron is nonlinear alternative learning algorithms such as the delta rule can be used as long as the activation function is differentiable nonetheless the learning algorithm described in the steps below will often work even for multilayer perceptrons with nonlinear activation functions when multiple perceptrons are combined in an artificial neural network each output neuron operates independently of all the others thus learning each output can be considered in isolation definitions edit we first define some variables r is the learning rate of the perceptron learning rate is between 0 and 1 larger values make the weight changes more volatile y f z displaystyle y f mathbf z denotes the output from the perceptron for an input vector z displaystyle mathbf z d x 1 d 1 x2026 x s d s displaystyle d mathbf x 1 d 1 dots mathbf x s d s is the training set of s displaystyle s samples where x j displaystyle mathbf x j is the n displaystyle n dimensional input vector d j displaystyle d j is the desired output value of the perceptron for that input we show the values of the features as follows x j i displaystyle x j i is the value of the i displaystyle i th feature of the j displaystyle j th training input vector x j 0 1 displaystyle x j 0 1 to represent the weights w i displaystyle w i is the i displaystyle i th value in the weight vector to be multiplied by the value of the i displaystyle i th input feature because x j 0 1 displaystyle x j 0 1 the w 0 displaystyle w 0 is effectively a bias that we use instead of the bias constant b displaystyle b to show the time dependence of w displaystyle mathbf w we use w i t displaystyle w i t is the weight i displaystyle i at time t displaystyle t steps edit initialize the weights weights may be initialized to 0 or to a small random value in the example below we use 0 for each example j in our training set d perform the following steps over the input x j displaystyle mathbf x j and desired output d j displaystyle d j calculate the actual output y j t f w t x22c5 x j f w 0 t x j 0 w 1 t x j 1 w 2 t x j 2 x22ef w n t x j n displaystyle begin

the iteration error 1 s x2211 j 1 s d j x2212 y j t displaystyle frac 1 s sum j 1 s d j y j t is less than a user specified error threshold x03b3 displaystyle gamma or a predetermined number of iterations have been completed where s is again the size of the sample set the algorithm updates the weights after steps 2a and 2b these weights are immediately applied to a pair in the training set and subsequently updated rather than waiting until all pairs in the training set have undergone these steps a diagram showing a perceptron updating its linear boundary as more training examples are added the appropriate weights are applied to the inputs and the resulting weighted sum passed to a function that produces the output o convergence edit the perceptron is a linear classifier therefore it will never get to the state with all the input vectors classified correctly if the training set d is not linearly separable i e if the positive examples cannot be separated from the negative examples by a hyperplane in this case no approximate solution will be gradually approached under the standard learning algorithm but instead learning will fail completely hence if linear separability of the training set is not known a priori one of the training variants below should be used if the training set is linearly separable then the perceptron is guaranteed to converge 91 11 93 furthermore there is an upper bound on the number of times the perceptron will adjust its weights during the training suppose that the input vectors from the two classes can be separated by a hyperplane with a margin x03b3 displaystyle gamma i e there exists a weight vector w w 1 displaystyle mathbf w mathbf w 1 and a bias term b such that w x22c5 x j gt x03b3 displaystyle mathbf w cdot mathbf x j gt gamma for all j displaystyle j with d j 1 displaystyle d j 1 and w x22c5 x j lt x2212 x03b3 displaystyle mathbf w cdot mathbf x j lt gamma for all j displaystyle j with d j 0 displaystyle d j 0 where d j displaystyle d j is the desired output value of the perceptron for input j displaystyle j also let r denote the maximum norm of an input vector novikoff 1962 proved that in this case the perceptron algorithm converges after making o r 2 x03b3 2 displaystyle o r 2 gamma 2 updates the idea of the proof is that the weight vector is always adjusted by a bounded amount in a direction with which it has a negative dot product and thus can be bounded above by o 8730 t where t is the number of changes to the weight vector however it can also be bounded below by o t because if there exists an unknown satisfactory weight vector then every change makes progress in this unknown direction by a positive amount that depends only on the input vector two classes of points and two of the infinitely many linear boundaries that separate them even though the boundaries are at nearly right angles to one another the perceptron algorithm has no way of choosing between them while the perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to converge on some solution in the case of a linearly separable training set it may still pick any solution and problems may admit many solutions of varying quality 91 12 93 the perceptron of optimal stability nowadays better known as the linear support vector machine was designed to solve this problem krauth and mezard 1987 91 13 93 variants edit the pocket algorithm with ratchet gallant 1990 solves the stability problem of perceptron learning by keeping the best solution seen so far in its pocket the pocket algorithm then returns the solution in the pocket rather than the last solution it can be used also for non separable data sets where the aim is to find a perceptron with a small number of misclassifications however these solutions appear purely stochastically and hence the pocket algorithm neither approaches them gradually in the course of learning nor are they guaranteed to show up within a given number of learning steps the maxover algorithm wendemuth 1995 is robust in the sense that it will converge regardless of prior knowledge of linear separability of the data set 91 14 93 in the linearly separable case it will solve the training problem if desired even with optimal stability maximum margin between the classes for non separable data sets it will return a solution with a small number of misclassifications in all cases the algorithm gradually approaches the solution in the course of learning without memorizing previous states and without stochastic jumps convergence is to global optimality for separable data sets and to local optimality for non separable data sets the voted perceptron freund and schapire 1999 is a variant using multiple weighted perceptrons the algorithm starts a new perceptron every time an example is wrongly classified initializing the weights vector with the final weights of the last perceptron each perceptron will also be given another weight corresponding to how many examples do they correctly classify before wrongly classifying one and at the end the output will be a weighted vote on all perceptrons in separable problems perceptron training can also aim at finding the largest separating margin between the classes the so called perceptron of optimal stability can be determined by means of iterative training and optimization schemes such as the min over algorithm krauth and mezard 1987 91 13 93 or the adatron anlauf and biehl 1989 91 15 93 adatron uses the fact that the corresponding quadratic optimization problem is convex the perceptron of optimal stability together with the kernel trick are the conceptual foundations of the support vector machine the x03b1 displaystyle alpha perceptron further used a pre processing layer of fixed random weights with thresholded output units this enabled the perceptron to classify analogue patterns by projecting them into a binary space in fact for a projection space of sufficiently high dimension patterns can become linearly separable another way to solve nonlinear problems without using multiple layers is to use higher order networks sigma pi unit in this type of network each element in the input vector is extended with each pairwise combination of multiplied inputs second order this can be extended to an n order network it should be kept in mind however that the best classifier is not necessarily that which classifies all the training data perfectly indeed if we had the prior constraint that the data come from equi variant gaussian distributions the linear separation in the input space is optimal and the nonlinear solution is overfitted other linear classification algorithms include winnow support vector machine and logistic regression multiclass perceptron edit like most other techniques for training linear classifiers the perceptron generalizes naturally to multiclass classification here the input x displaystyle x and the output y displaystyle y are drawn from arbitrary sets a feature representation function f x y displaystyle f x y maps each possible input output pair to a finite dimensional real valued feature vector as before the feature vector is multiplied by a weight vector w displaystyle w but now the resulting score is used to choose among many possible outputs y x005e argmax y x2061 f x y x22c5 w displaystyle hat y operatorname argmax y f x y cdot w learning again iterates over the examples predicting an output for each leaving the weights unchanged when the predicted output matches the target and changing them when it does not the update becomes w t 1 w t f x y x2212 f x y x005e displaystyle w t 1 w t f x y f x hat y this multiclass feedback formulation reduces to the original perceptron when x displaystyle x is a real valued vector y displaystyle y is chosen from 0 1 displaystyle 0 1 and f x y y x displaystyle f x y yx for certain problems input output representations and features can be chosen so that a r g m a x y f x y x22c5 w displaystyle mathrm argmax y f x y cdot w can be found efficiently even though y displaystyle y is chosen from a very large or even infinite set since 2002 perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part of speech tagging and syntactic parsing collins 2002 it has also been applied to large scale machine learning problems in a distributed computing
