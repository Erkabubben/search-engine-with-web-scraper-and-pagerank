emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own properties or behaviors that emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems for instance the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry in philosophy theories that

article emergentism philosophers often understand emergence as a claim about the etiology of a system s properties an emergent property of a system in this context is one that is not a property of any component of that system but is still a feature of the system as a whole nicolai hartmann 1882 1950 one of the first modern philosophers to write on emergence termed this a categorial novum new category definitions edit this concept of emergence dates from at least the time of aristotle 91 2 93 the many scientists and philosophers 91 3 93 who have written on the concept include john stuart mill composition of causes 1843 91 4 93 and julian huxley 91 5 93 1887 1975 the philosopher g h lewes coined the term emergent in 1875 distinguishing it from the merely resultant every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co operant forces their sum when their directions are the same their difference when their directions are contrary further every resultant is clearly traceable in its components because these are homogeneous and commensurable it is otherwise with emergents when instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind there is a co operation of things of unlike kinds the emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference 91 6 93 91 7 93 in 1999 economist jeffrey goldstein provided a current definition of emergence in the journal emergence 91 8 93 goldstein initially defined emergence as the arising of novel and coherent structures patterns and properties during the process of self organization in complex systems in 2002 systems scientist peter corning described the qualities of goldstein s definition in more detail the common characteristics are 1 radical novelty features not previously observed in systems 2 coherence or correlation meaning integrated wholes that maintain themselves over some period of time 3 a global or macro level i e there is some property of wholeness 4 it is the product of a dynamical process it evolves and 5 it is ostensive it can be perceived 91 9 93 corning suggests a narrower definition requiring that the components be unlike in kind following lewes and that they involve division of labor between these components he also says that living systems comparably to the game of chess while emergent cannot be reduced to underlying laws of emergence rules or laws have no causal efficacy they do not in fact generate anything they serve merely to describe regularities and consistent relationships in nature these patterns may be very illuminating and important but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified though often they are not but that aside the game of chess illustrates why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient even in a chess game you cannot use the rules to predict history i e the course of any given game indeed you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game why because the system involves more than the rules of the game it also includes the players and their unfolding moment by moment decisions among a very large number of available options at each choice point the game of chess is inescapably historical even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules not to mention the laws of physics moreover and this is a key point the game of chess is also shaped by teleonomic cybernetic feedback driven influences it is not simply a self ordered process it involves an organized purposeful activity 91 9 93 strong and weak emergence edit usage of the notion emergence may generally be subdivided into two perspectives that of weak emergence and strong emergence one paper discussing this division is weak emergence by philosopher mark bedau in terms of physical systems weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation or similar forms of after the fact analysis for example the formation of a traffic jam the structure of a flock of starlings in flight or a school of fish or the formation of galaxies crucial in these simulations is that the interacting members retain their independence if not a new entity is formed with new emergent properties this is called strong emergence which it is argued cannot be simulated or analysed some common points between the two notions are that emergence concerns new properties produced as the system grows which is to say ones which are not shared with its components or prior states also it is assumed that the properties are supervenient rather than metaphysically primitive 91 10 93 weak emergence describes new properties arising in systems as a result of the interactions at an elemental level however bedau stipulates that the properties can be determined only by observing or simulating the system and not by any process of a reductionist analysis as a consequence the emerging properties are scale dependent they are only observable if the system is large enough to exhibit the phenomenon chaotic unpredictable behaviour can be seen as an emergent phenomenon while at a microscopic scale the behaviour of the constituent parts can be fully deterministic bedau notes that weak emergence is not a universal metaphysical solvent as the hypothesis that consciousness is weakly emergent would not resolve the traditional philosophical questions about the physicality of consciousness however bedau concludes that adopting this view would provide a precise notion that emergence is involved in consciousness and second the notion of weak emergence is metaphysically benign 91 10 93 strong emergence describes the direct causal action of a high level system upon its components qualities produced this way are irreducible to the system s constituent parts 91 11 93 the whole is other than the sum of its parts it is argued then that no simulation of the system can exist for such a simulation would itself constitute a reduction of the system to its constituent parts 91 10 93 physics lacks well established examples of strong emergence unless it is interpreted as the impossibility in practice to explain the whole in terms of the parts practical impossibility may be a more useful distinction than one in principle since it is easier to determine and quantify and does not imply the use of mysterious forces but simply reflects the limits of our capability 91 12 93 rejecting the distinction edit however biologist peter corning has asserted that the debate about whether or not the whole can be predicted from the properties of the parts misses the point wholes produce unique combined effects but many of these effects may be co determined by the context and the interactions between the whole and its environment s 91 13 93 in accordance with his synergism hypothesis 91 14 93 91 15 93 corning also stated it is the synergistic effects produced by wholes that are the very cause of the evolution of complexity in nature novelist arthur koestler used the metaphor of janus a symbol of the unity underlying complements like open shut peace war to illustrate how the two perspectives strong vs weak or holistic vs reductionistic should be treated as non exclusive and should work together to address the issues of emergence 91 16 93 theoretical physicist pw anderson states it this way the ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe the constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear psychology is not applied biology nor is biology applied chemistry we can now see that the whole becomes not merely more but very different from the sum of its parts 91 17 93 viability of strong emergence edit some thinkers question the plausibility of strong emergence as contravening our usual understanding of physics mark a bedau observes although strong emergence is logically possible it is uncomfortably like magic how does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro level potentialities such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken this not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing 91 18 93 strong emergence can be criticized for being causally overdetermined the canonical example concerns emergent mental states m and m that supervene on physical states p and p respectively let m and m be emergent properties let m supervene on base property p what happens when m causes m jaegwon kim says in our schematic example above we concluded that m causes m by causing p so m causes p now m as an emergent must itself have an emergence base property say p now we face a critical question if an emergent m emerges from basal condition p why cannot p displace m as a cause of any putative effect of m why cannot p do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of m occurred if causation is understood as nomological law based sufficiency p as m s emergence base is nomologically sufficient for it and m as p s cause is nomologically sufficient for p it follows that p is nomologically sufficient for p and hence qualifies as its cause if m is somehow retained as a cause we are faced with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves overdetermination since p remains a cause of p as well moreover this goes against the spirit of emergentism in any case emergents are supposed to make distinctive and novel causal contributions 91 19 93 if m is the cause of m then m is overdetermined because m can also be thought of as being determined by p one escape route that a strong emergentist could take would be to deny downward causation however this would remove the proposed reason that emergent mental states must supervene on physical states which in turn would call physicalism into question and thus be unpalatable for some philosophers and physicists meanwhile others have worked towards developing analytical evidence of strong emergence in 2009 gu et al presented a class of infinite physical systems that exhibits non computable macroscopic properties 91 20 93 91 21 93 more precisely if one could compute certain macroscopic properties of these systems from the microscopic description of these systems then one would be able to solve computational problems known to be undecidable in computer science these results concern infinite systems finite systems being considered computable however macroscopic concepts which only apply in the limit of infinite systems such as phase transitions and the renormalization group are important for understanding and modeling real finite physical systems gu et al concluded that although macroscopic concepts are essential for understanding our world much of fundamental physics has been devoted to the search for a theory of everything a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles the view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts at least in principle the evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic a theory of everything is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe but is not necessarily the only one the development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic and could require conjectures suggested by experiments simulations or insight 91 20 93 emergence and interaction edit emergent structures are patterns that emerge via the collective actions of many individual entities to explain such patterns one might conclude per aristotle 91 2 93 that emergent structures are more than the sum of their parts on the assumption that the emergent order will not arise if the various parts simply act independently of one another however there are those who disagree 91 22 93 according to this argument the interaction of each part with its immediate surroundings causes a complex chain of processes that can lead to order in some form in fact some systems in nature are observed to exhibit emergence based upon the interactions of autonomous parts and some others exhibit emergence that at least at present cannot be reduced in this way in particular renormalization methods in theoretical physics enable scientists to study systems that are not tractable as the combination of their parts 91 23 93 objective or subjective quality edit crutchfield regards the properties of complexity and organization of any system as subjective qualities determined by the observer defining structure and detecting the emergence of complexity in nature are inherently subjective though essential scientific activities despite the difficulties these problems can be analysed in terms of how model building observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non linear processes an observer s notion of what is ordered what is random and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources the amount of raw measurement data of memory and of time available for estimation and inference the discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly though on how those resources are organized the descriptive power of the observer s chosen or implicit computational model class for example can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data 91 24 93 on the other hand peter corning argues must the synergies be perceived observed in order to qualify as emergent effects as some theorists claim most emphatically not the synergies associated with emergence are real and measurable even if nobody is there to observe them 91 13 93 the low entropy of an ordered system can be viewed as an example of subjective emergence the observer sees an ordered system by ignoring the underlying microstructure i e movement of molecules or elementary particles and concludes that the system has a low entropy 91 25 93 on the other hand chaotic unpredictable behaviour can also be seen as subjective emergent while at a microscopic scale the movement of the constituent parts can be fully deterministic in religion art and humanities edit in religion emergence grounds expressions of religious naturalism and syntheism in which a sense of the sacred is perceived in the workings of entirely naturalistic processes by which more complex forms arise or evolve from simpler forms examples are detailed in the sacred emergence of nature by ursula goodenough amp terrence deacon and beyond reductionism reinventing the sacred by stuart kauffman both from 2006 as well as syntheism creating god in the internet age by alexander bard amp jan s derqvist from 2014 and emergentism a religion of complexity for the metamodern world by brendan graham dempsey 2022 an early argument 1904 05 for the emergence of social formations in part stemming from religion can be found in max weber s most famous work the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism 91 26 93 recently the emergence of a new social system is linked with the emergence of order from nonlinear relationships among multiple interacting units where multiple interacting units are individual thoughts consciousness and actions 91 27 93 in art emergence is used to explore the origins of novelty creativity and authorship some art literary theorists wheeler 2006 91 28 93 alexander 2011 91 29 93 have proposed alternatives to postmodern understandings of authorship using the complexity sciences and emergence theory they contend that artistic selfhood and meaning are emergent relatively objective phenomena michael j pearce has used emergence to describe the experience of works of art in relation to contemporary neuroscience 91 30 93 practicing artist leonel moura in turn attributes to his artbots a real if nonetheless rudimentary creativity based on emergent principles 91 31 93 in literature and linguistics the concept of emergence has been applied in the domain of stylometry to explain the interrelation between the syntactical structures of the text and the author style slautina marusenko 2014 91 32 93 in international development concepts of emergence have been used within a theory of social change termed seed scale to show how standard principles interact to bring forward socio economic development fitted to cultural values community economics and natural environment local solutions emerging from the larger socio econo biosphere these principles can be implemented utilizing a sequence of standardized tasks that self assemble in individually specific ways utilizing recursive evaluative criteria 91 33 93 in postcolonial studies the term emerging literature refers to a contemporary body of texts that is gaining momentum in the global literary landscape v esp j m grassin ed emerging literatures bern berlin etc 160 peter lang 1996 by opposition emergent literature is rather a concept used in the theory of literature emergent properties and processes edit an emergent behavior or emergent property can appear when a number of simple entities agents operate in an environment forming more complex behaviors as a collective if emergence happens over disparate size scales then the reason is usually a causal relation across different scales in other words there is often a form of top down feedback in systems with emergent properties the processes causing emergent properties may occur in either the observed or observing system and are commonly identifiable by their patterns of accumulating change generally called growth emergent behaviours can occur because of intricate causal relations across different scales and feedback known as interconnectivity the emergent property itself may be either very predictable or unpredictable and unprecedented and represent a new level of the system s evolution the complex behaviour or properties are not a property of any single such entity nor can they easily be predicted or deduced from behaviour in the lower level entities 91 34 93 the shape and behaviour of a flock of birds or school of fish are good examples of emergent properties one reason emergent behaviour is hard to predict is that the number of interactions between a system s components increases exponentially with the number of components thus allowing for many new and subtle types of behaviour to emerge emergence is often a product of particular patterns of interaction negative feedback introduces constraints that serve to fix structures or behaviours in contrast positive feedback promotes change allowing local variations to grow into global patterns another way in which interactions lead to emergent properties is dual phase evolution this occurs where interactions are applied intermittently leading to two phases one in which patterns form or grow the other in which they are refined or removed on the other hand merely having a large number of interactions is not enough by itself to guarantee emergent behaviour many of the interactions may be negligible or irrelevant or may cancel each other out in some cases a large number of interactions can in fact hinder the emergence of interesting behaviour by creating a lot of noise to drown out any emerging signal the emergent behaviour may need to be temporarily isolated from other interactions before it reaches enough critical mass to self support thus it is not just the sheer number of connections between components which encourages emergence it is also how these connections are organised a hierarchical organisation is one example that can generate emergent behaviour a bureaucracy may behave in a way quite different from the individual departments of that bureaucracy but emergent behaviour can also arise from more decentralized organisational structures such as a marketplace in some cases the system has to reach a combined threshold of diversity organisation and connectivity before emergent behaviour appears unintended consequences and side effects are closely related to emergent properties luc steels writes a component has a particular functionality but this is not recognizable as a subfunction of the global functionality instead a component implements a behaviour whose side effect contributes to the global functionality each behaviour has a side effect and the sum of the side effects gives the desired functionality 91 35 93 in other words the global or macroscopic functionality of a system with emergent functionality is the sum of all side effects of all emergent properties and functionalities systems with emergent properties or emergent structures may appear to defy entropic principles and the second law of thermodynamics because they form and increase order despite the lack of command and central control this is possible because open systems can extract information and order out of the environment emergence helps to explain why the fallacy of division is a fallacy emergent structures in nature edit main article patterns in

learn how and when to remove this template message ripple patterns in a sand dune created by wind or water are an example of an emergent structure in nature giant s causeway in northern ireland is an example of a complex emergent structure emergent structures can be found in many natural phenomena from the physical to the biological domain for example the shape of weather phenomena such as hurricanes are emergent structures the development and growth of complex orderly crystals as driven by the random motion of water molecules within a conducive natural environment is another example of an emergent process where randomness can give rise to complex and deeply attractive orderly structures water crystals forming on glass demonstrate an emergent fractal process occurring under appropriate conditions of temperature and humidity however crystalline structure and hurricanes are said to have a self organizing phase it is useful to distinguish three forms of emergent structures a first order emergent structure occurs as a result of shape interactions for example hydrogen bonds in water molecules lead to surface tension a second order emergent structure involves shape interactions played out sequentially over time for example changing atmospheric conditions as a snowflake falls to the ground build upon and alter its form finally a third order emergent structure is a consequence of shape time and heritable instructions for example an organism s genetic code affects the form of the organism s systems in space and time nonliving physical systems edit in physics emergence is used to describe a property law or phenomenon which occurs at macroscopic scales in space or time but not at microscopic scales despite the fact that a macroscopic system can be viewed as a very large ensemble of microscopic systems 91 36 93 91 37 93 an emergent property need not be more complicated than the underlying non emergent properties which generate it for instance the laws of thermodynamics are remarkably simple even if the laws which govern the interactions between component particles are complex the term emergence in physics is thus used not to signify complexity but rather to distinguish which laws and concepts apply to macroscopic scales and which ones apply to microscopic scales however another perhaps more broadly applicable way to conceive of the emergent divide does involve a dose of complexity insofar as the computational feasibility of going from the microscopic to the macroscopic property tells the strength of the emergence this is better understood given the following definition of weak emergence that comes from physics an emergent behavior of a physical system is a qualitative property that can only occur in the limit that the number of microscopic constituents tends to infinity 91 38 93 since there are no actually infinite systems in the real world there is no obvious naturally occurring notion of a hard separation between the properties of the constituents of a system and those of the emergent whole as discussed below classical mechanics is thought to be emergent from quantum mechanics though in principle quantum dynamics fully describes everything happening at a classical level however it would take a computer larger than the size of the universe with more computing time than life time of the universe to describe the motion of a falling apple in terms of the locations of its electrons 91 citation needed 93 thus we can take this to be a strong emergent divide in the case of strong emergence the number of constituents can be much smaller f i the emergent properties of a h2o molecule are very different from its constituent parts oxygen and hydrogen some examples include classical mechanics the laws of classical mechanics can be said to emerge as a limiting case from the rules of quantum mechanics applied to large enough masses this is particularly strange since quantum mechanics is generally thought of as more complicated than classical mechanics friction forces between elementary particles are conservative however friction emerges when considering more complex structures of matter whose surfaces can convert mechanical energy into heat energy when rubbed against each other similar considerations apply to other emergent concepts in continuum mechanics such as viscosity elasticity tensile strength etc patterned ground the distinct and often symmetrical geometric shapes formed by ground material in periglacial regions statistical mechanics initially derived using the concept of a large enough ensemble that fluctuations about the most likely distribution can be all but ignored however small clusters do not exhibit sharp first order phase transitions such as melting and at the boundary it is not possible to completely categorize the cluster as a liquid or solid since these concepts are without extra definitions only applicable to macroscopic systems describing a system using statistical mechanics methods is much simpler than using a low level atomistic approach electrical networks the bulk conductive response of binary rc electrical networks with random arrangements known as the universal dielectric response udr can be seen as emergent properties of such physical systems such arrangements can be used as simple physical prototypes for deriving mathematical formulae for the emergent responses of complex systems 91 39 93 weather temperature is sometimes used as an example of an emergent macroscopic behaviour in classical dynamics a snapshot of the instantaneous momenta of a large number of particles at equilibrium is sufficient to find the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom which is proportional to the temperature for a small number of particles the instantaneous momenta at a given time are not statistically sufficient to determine the temperature of the system however using the ergodic hypothesis the temperature can still be obtained to arbitrary precision by further averaging the momenta over a long enough time convection in a liquid or gas is another example of emergent macroscopic behaviour that makes sense only when considering differentials of temperature convection cells particularly b nard cells are an example of a self organizing system more specifically a dissipative system whose structure is determined both by the constraints of the system and by random perturbations the possible realizations of the shape and size of the cells depends on the temperature gradient as well as the nature of the fluid and shape of the container but which configurations are actually realized is due to random perturbations thus these systems exhibit a form of symmetry breaking in some theories of particle physics even such basic structures as mass space and time are viewed as emergent phenomena arising from more fundamental concepts such as the higgs boson or strings in some interpretations of quantum mechanics the perception of a deterministic reality in which all objects have a definite position momentum and so forth is actually an emergent phenomenon with the true state of matter being described instead by a wavefunction which need not have a single position or momentum most of the laws of physics themselves as we experience them today appear to have emerged during the course of time making emergence the most fundamental principle in the universe 91 according to whom 93 and raising the question of what might be the most fundamental law of physics from which all others emerged chemistry can in turn be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of physics biology including biological evolution can be viewed as an emergent property of the laws of chemistry similarly psychology could be understood as an emergent property of neurobiological laws finally some economic theories understand economy as an emergent feature of psychology according to laughlin 91 11 93 for many particle systems nothing can be calculated exactly from the microscopic equations and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system due to phase transitions as a result these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details this does not mean that the microscopic interactions are irrelevant but simply that you do not see them anymore 160 you only see a renormalized effect of them laughlin is a pragmatic theoretical physicist if you cannot possibly ever calculate the broken symmetry macroscopic properties from the microscopic equations then what is the point of talking about reducibility living biological systems edit emergence and evolution edit see also abiogenesis life is a major source of complexity and evolution is the major process behind the varying forms of life in this view evolution is the process describing the growth of complexity in the natural world and in speaking of the emergence of complex living beings and life forms life is thought to have emerged in the early rna world when rna chains began to express the basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by darwin heritability variation of type and competition for limited resources fitness of an rna replicator its per capita rate of increase would likely be a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic in the sense that they were determined by the nucleotide sequence and the availability of resources 91 40 93 91 41 93 the three primary adaptive capacities may have been 1 the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity giving rise to both heritability and variation of type 2 the capacity to avoid decay and 3 the capacity to acquire and process resources 91 40 93 91 41 93 these capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations of the rna replicators see ribozyme that in turn would be encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences competitive success among different replicators would have depended on the relative values of these adaptive capacities regarding causality in evolution peter corning observes synergistic effects of various kinds have played a major causal role in the evolutionary process generally and in the evolution of cooperation and complexity in particular natural selection is often portrayed as a mechanism or is personified as a causal agency in reality the differential selection of a trait or an adaptation is a consequence of the functional effects it produces in relation to the survival and reproductive success of a given organism in a given environment it is these functional effects that are ultimately responsible for the trans generational continuities and changes in nature 91 13 93 per his definition of emergence corning also addresses emergence and evolution in evolutionary processes causation is iterative effects are also causes and this is equally true of the synergistic effects produced by emergent systems in other words emergence itself has been the underlying cause of the evolution of emergent phenomena in biological evolution it is the synergies produced by organized systems that are the key 91 13 93 swarming is a well known behaviour in many animal species from marching locusts to schooling fish to flocking birds emergent structures are a common strategy found in many animal groups colonies of ants mounds built by termites swarms of bees shoals schools of fish flocks of birds and herds packs of mammals an example to consider in detail is an ant colony the queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do instead each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae other ants intruders food and buildup of waste and leaves behind a chemical trail which in turn provides a stimulus to other ants here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant despite the lack of centralized decision making ant colonies exhibit complex behavior and have even demonstrated the ability to solve geometric problems for example colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies 91 42 93 it appears that environmental factors may play a role in influencing emergence research suggests induced emergence of the bee species macrotera portalis in this species the bees emerge in a pattern consistent with rainfall specifically the pattern of emergence is consistent with southwestern deserts late summer rains and lack of activity in the spring 91 43 93 organization of life edit a broader example of emergent properties in biology is viewed in the biological organisation of life ranging from the subatomic level to the entire biosphere for example individual atoms can be combined to form molecules such as polypeptide chains which in turn fold and refold to form proteins which in turn create even more complex structures these proteins assuming their functional status from their spatial conformation interact together and with other molecules to achieve higher biological functions and eventually create an organism another example is how cascade phenotype reactions as detailed in chaos theory arise from individual genes mutating respective positioning 91 44 93 at the highest level all the biological communities in the world form the biosphere where its human participants form societies and the complex interactions of meta social systems emergence of mind edit among the considered phenomena in the evolutionary account of life as a continuous history marked by stages at which fundamentally new forms have appeared the origin of sapiens intelligence 91 45 93 the emergence of mind and its evolution is researched and considered as a separate phenomenon in a special system knowledge called noogenesis 91 46 93 in humanity edit spontaneous order edit see also spontaneous order and self organization groups of human beings left free to each regulate themselves tend to produce spontaneous order rather than the meaningless chaos often feared this has been observed in society at least since chuang tzu in ancient china human beings are the basic elements of social systems which perpetually interact and create maintain or untangle mutual social bonds social bonds in social systems are perpetually changing in the sense of the ongoing reconfiguration of their structure 91 47 93 a classic traffic roundabout is also a good example with cars moving in and out with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with roundabouts 91 48 93 and getting better results open source software and wiki projects form an even more compelling illustration emergent processes or behaviors can be seen in many other places such as cities cabal and market dominant minority phenomena in economics organizational phenomena in computer simulations and cellular automata whenever there is a multitude of individuals interacting an order emerges from disorder a pattern a decision a structure or a change in direction occurs 91 49 93 economics edit the stock market or any market for that matter is an example of emergence on a grand scale as a whole it precisely regulates the relative security prices of companies across the world yet it has no leader when no central planning is in place there is no one entity which controls the workings of the entire market agents or investors have knowledge of only a limited number of companies within their portfolio and must follow the regulatory rules of the market and analyse the transactions individually or in large groupings trends and patterns which emerge are studied intensively by technical analysts 91 50 93 world wide web and the internet edit the world wide web is a popular example of a decentralized system exhibiting emergent properties there is no central organization rationing the number of links yet the number of links pointing to each page follows a power law in which a few pages are linked to many times and most pages are seldom linked to a related property of the network of links in the world wide web is that almost any pair of pages can be connected to each other through a relatively short chain of links although relatively well known now this property was initially unexpected in an unregulated network it is shared with many other types of networks called small world networks 91 51 93 internet traffic can also exhibit some seemingly emergent properties in the congestion control mechanism tcp flows can become globally synchronized at bottlenecks simultaneously increasing and then decreasing throughput in coordination congestion widely regarded as a nuisance is possibly an emergent property of the spreading of bottlenecks across a network in high traffic flows which can be considered as a phase transition 91 52 93 another important example of emergence in web based systems is social bookmarking also called collaborative tagging in social bookmarking systems users assign tags to resources shared with other users which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems 91 53 93 has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge even in the absence of a central controlled vocabulary some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words the convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information a process called semantic imitation 91 54 93 91 55 93 architecture and cities edit traffic patterns in cities can be seen as an example of spontaneous order 91 citation needed 93 emergent structures appear at many different levels of organization or as spontaneous order emergent self organization appears frequently in cities where no planning or zoning entity predetermines the layout of the city 91 56 93 the interdisciplinary study of emergent behaviors is not generally considered a homogeneous field but divided across its application or problem domains architects may not design all the pathways of a complex of buildings instead they might let usage patterns emerge and then place pavement where pathways have become worn such as a desire path the on course action and vehicle progression of the 2007 urban challenge could possibly be regarded as an example of cybernetic emergence patterns of road use indeterministic obstacle clearance times etc will work together to form a complex emergent pattern that can not be deterministically planned in advance the architectural school of christopher alexander takes a deeper approach to emergence attempting to rewrite the process of urban growth itself in order to affect form establishing a new methodology of planning and design tied to traditional practices an emergent urbanism urban emergence has also been linked to theories of urban complexity 91 57 93 and urban evolution 91 58 93 building ecology is a conceptual framework for understanding architecture and the built environment as the interface between the dynamically interdependent elements of buildings their occupants and the larger environment rather than viewing buildings as inanimate or static objects building ecologist hal levin views them as interfaces or intersecting domains of living and non living systems 91 59 93 the microbial ecology of the indoor environment is strongly dependent on the building materials occupants contents environmental context and the indoor and outdoor climate the strong relationship between atmospheric chemistry and indoor air quality and the chemical reactions occurring indoors the chemicals may be nutrients neutral or biocides for the microbial organisms the microbes produce chemicals that affect the building materials and occupant health and well being humans manipulate the ventilation temperature and humidity to achieve comfort with the concomitant effects on the microbes that populate and evolve 91 59 93 91 60 93 91 61 93 eric bonabeau s attempt to define emergent phenomena is through traffic traffic jams are actually very complicated and mysterious on an individual level each driver is trying to get somewhere and is following or breaking certain rules some legal the speed limit and others societal or personal slow down to let another driver change into your lane but a traffic jam is a separate and distinct entity that emerges from those individual behaviors gridlock on a highway for example can travel backward for no apparent reason even as the cars are moving forward he has also likened emergent phenomena to the analysis of market trends and employee behavior 91 62 93 computer ai edit some artificially intelligent ai computer applications simulate emergent behavior 91 63 93 one example is boids which mimics the swarming behavior of birds 91 64 93 language edit it has been argued that the structure and regularity of language grammar or at least language change is an emergent phenomenon 91 65 93 while each speaker merely tries to reach their own communicative goals they use language in a particular way if enough speakers behave in that way language is changed 91 66 93 in a wider sense the norms of a language i e the linguistic conventions of its speech society can be seen as a system emerging from long time participation in communicative problem solving in various social circumstances 91 67 93 emergent change processes edit within the field of group facilitation and organization development there have been a number of new group processes that are designed to maximize emergence and self organization by offering a minimal set of effective initial conditions examples of these processes include seed scale appreciative inquiry future search the world cafe or knowledge cafe open space technology and others holman 2010 91 68 93 see also edit abstraction 160 8211 process of
