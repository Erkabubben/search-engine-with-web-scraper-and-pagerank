methods that learn that is methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks 91 1 93 it is seen as a part of artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so 91 2 93 machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications such as in medicine email filtering speech recognition agriculture and computer vision where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks 91 3 93 91 4 93 a subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics which focuses on making predictions using computers but not all machine learning is statistical learning the study of mathematical optimization delivers methods theory and application domains to the field of machine learning data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning 91 6 93 91 7 93 some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain 91 8 93 91 9 93 in its

inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning for the last 10 000 days it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well they can be nuanced such as x of families have geographically separate species with color variants so there is a y chance that undiscovered black swans exist 91 10 93 machine learning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so it involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks for simple tasks assigned to computers it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand on the computer s part no learning is needed for more advanced tasks it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms in practice it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm rather than having human programmers specify every needed step 91 11 93 the discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available in cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid this can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm s it uses to determine correct answers for example to train a system for the task of digital character recognition the mnist dataset of handwritten digits has often been used 91 11 93 history and relationships to other fields edit see also timeline of machine learning the term machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence 91 12 93 91 13 93 the synonym self teaching computers was also used in this time period 91 14 93 91 15 93 by the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called cybertron had been developed by raytheon company to analyze sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning it was repetitively trained by a human operator teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to re evaluate incorrect decisions 91 16 93 a representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was nilsson s book on learning machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification 91 17 93 interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by duda and hart in 1973 91 18 93 in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal 91 19 93 tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e 91 20 93 this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turing s proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do 91 21 93 modern day machine learning has two objectives one is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models a hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions 91 22 93 artificial intelligence edit machine learning as subfield of ai 91 23 93 part of machine learning as subfield of ai or part of ai as subfield of machine learning 91 24 93 as a scientific endeavor machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what was then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics 91 25 93 probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis 91 26 93 58 8202 488 8202 however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledge based approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation 91 26 93 58 8202 488 8202 by 1980 expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favor 91 27 93 work on symbolic knowledge based learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval 91 26 93 58 8202 708 710 8202 755 8202 neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the ai cs field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mid 1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation 91 26 93 58 8202 25 8202 machine learning ml reorganized as a separate field started to flourish in the 1990s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory 91 27 93 the difference between ml and ai is frequently misunderstood ml learns and predicts based on passive observations whereas ai implies an agent interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals 91 28 93 as of 2020 many sources continue to assert that ml remains a subfield of ai 91 29 93 91 30 93 91 27 93 others have the view that not all ml is part of ai but only an intelligent subset of ml should be considered ai 91 5 93 91 31 93 91 32 93 data mining edit machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data optimization edit machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the pre assigned labels of a set of examples 91 33 93 generalization edit the difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms statistics edit machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns 91 34 93 according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long pre history in statistics 91 35 93 he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field 91 35 93 leo breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model 91 29 93 wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning 91 30 93 physics edit analytical and computational techniques derived from statistical physics of disordered systems can be extended to large scale problems including machine learning e g to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks 91 36 93 statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics 91 37 93 theory edit main articles computational learning theory and statistical learning theory a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience 91 5 93 91 31 93 generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examples tasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning pac model because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the bias variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer 91 32 93 in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time approaches edit machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent as it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback that s analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize 91 5 93 supervised learning edit main article supervised learning a support vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary here the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs 91 38 93 the data is known as training data and consists of a set of training examples each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs 91 39 93 an optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task 91 20 93 types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning classification and regression 91 28 93 classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range as an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are it has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification unsupervised learning edit main article unsupervised learningsee also cluster analysis unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs and find structure in the data like grouping or clustering of data points the algorithms therefore learn from test data that has not been labeled classified or categorized instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data a central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics such as finding the probability density function 91 40 93 though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity semi supervised learning edit main article semi supervised learning semi supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machine learning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy in weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets 91 41 93 reinforcement learning edit main article reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulation based optimization multi agent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in machine learning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques 91 42 93 reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent dimensionality reduction edit dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables 91 43 93 in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca pca involves changing higher dimensional data e g 3d to a smaller space e g 2d this results in a smaller dimension of data 2d instead of 3d while keeping all original variables in the model without changing the data 91 44 93 the manifold hypothesis proposes that high dimensional data sets lie along low dimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization other types edit other approaches have been developed which don t fit neatly into this three fold categorization and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system for example topic modeling meta learning 91 45 93 as of 2022 deep learning is the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning 91 11 93 self learning edit self learning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self learning named crossbar adaptive array caa 91 46 93 it is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice the caa self learning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion 91 47 93 the self learning algorithm updates a memory matrix w w a s such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s perform action a receive consequence situation s compute emotion of being in consequence situation v s update crossbar memory w a s w a s v s it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goal seeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations 91 48 93 feature learning edit main article feature learning several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training 91 49 93 classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a pre processing step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization 91 50 93 and various forms of clustering 91 51 93 91 52 93 91 53 93 manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low dimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higher dimensional vectors 91 54 93 deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higher level more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lower level features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data 91 55 93 feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however real world data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms sparse dictionary learning edit main article sparse dictionary learning sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and is assumed to be a sparse matrix the method is strongly np hard and difficult to solve approximately 91 56 93 a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k svd algorithm sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de noising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot 91 57 93 anomaly detection edit main article anomaly detection in data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data 91 58 93 typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions 91 59 93 in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro clusters formed by these patterns 91 60 93 three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist 91 61 93 unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection semi supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model robot learning edit robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning 91 62 93 91 63 93 and finally meta learning e g maml association rules edit main article association rule learningsee also inductive logic programming association rule learning is a rule based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness 91 64 93 rule based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge the defining characteristic of a rule based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction 91 65 93 rule based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal tomasz imieli ski and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale pos systems in supermarkets 91 66 93 for example the rule o n i o n s p o t a t o e s x21d2 b u r g e r displaystyle mathrm onions potatoes rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements in addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics in contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions learning classifier systems lcs are a family of rule based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning they seek to identify a set of context dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions 91 67 93 inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting 91 68 93 91 69 93 91 70 93 shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in 1981 a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples 91 71 93 the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a well ordered set models edit performing machine learning involves creating a model which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems artificial neural networks edit main article artificial neural networksee also deep learning an artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain here each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any task specific rules an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non linear function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition 91 72 93 decision trees edit main article decision tree learning a decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the titanic decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the item s target value represented in the leaves it is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making in data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making support vector machines edit main article support vector machine support vector machines svms also known as support vector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category 91 73 93 an svm training algorithm is a non probabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a non linear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into high dimensional feature spaces regression analysis edit main article regression analysis illustration of linear regression on a data set regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with non linear problems go to models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel 91 74 93 logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces non linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space bayesian networks edit main article bayesian network a simple bayesian network rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams gaussian processes edit main article gaussian processes an example of gaussian process regression prediction compared with other regression models 91 75 93 a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a pre defined covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations given a set of observed points or input output examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization genetic algorithms edit main article genetic algorithm a genetic algorithm ga is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s 91 76 93 91 77 93 conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms 91 78 93 training models edit typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data in order for the models to perform accurate predictions when training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model trained models derived from biased or non evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably be integrated within machine learning engineering teams federated learning edit main article federated learning federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server this also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices for example gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google 91 79 93 applications edit there are many applications for machine learning including agriculture anatomy adaptive website affective computing astronomy automated decision making banking behaviorism bioinformatics brain machine interfaces cheminformatics citizen science climate science computer networks computer vision credit card fraud detection data quality dna sequence classification economics financial market analysis 91 80 93 general game playing handwriting recognition information retrieval insurance internet fraud detection knowledge graph embedding linguistics machine learning control machine perception machine translation marketing medical diagnosis natural language processing natural language understanding online advertising optimization recommender systems robot locomotion search engines sentiment analysis sequence mining software engineering speech recognition structural health monitoring syntactic pattern recognition telecommunication theorem proving time series forecasting user behavior analytics in 2006 the media services provider netflix held the first netflix prize competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10 a joint team made up of researchers from at amp t labs research in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in 2009 for 1 million 91 81 93 shortly after the prize was awarded netflix realized that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly 91 82 93 in 2010 the wall street journal wrote about the firm rebellion research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis 91 83 93 in 2012 co founder of sun microsystems vinod khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software 91 84 93 in 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists 91 85 93 in 2019 springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning 91 86 93 in 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for covid 19 91 87 93 machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro environmental behavior of travelers 91 88 93 recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone s performance and thermal behavior based on the user s interaction with the phone 91 89 93 91 90 93 91 91 93 limitations edit although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machine learning programs often fail to deliver expected results 91 92 93 91 93 93 91 94 93 reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems 91 95 93 in 2018 a self driving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision 91 96 93 attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested 91 97 93 91 98 93 machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves 91 99 93 bias edit main article algorithmic bias machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data when trained on man made data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society 91 100 93 language models learned from data have been shown to contain human like biases 91 101 93 91 102 93 machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people 91 103 93 91 104 93 in 2015 google photos would often tag black people as gorillas 91 105 93 and in 2018 this still was not well resolved but google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all 91 106 93 similar issues with recognizing non white people have been found in many other systems 91 107 93 in 2016 microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language 91 108 93 because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains 91 109 93 concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including fei fei li who reminds engineers that there s nothing artificial about ai it s inspired by people it s created by people and most importantly it impacts people it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility 91 110 93 explainability edit main article explainable artificial intelligence explainable ai xai or interpretable ai or explainable machine learning xml is artificial intelligence ai in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai it contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an ai arrived at a specific decision by refining the mental models of users of ai powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions xai promises to help users perform more effectively xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation overfitting edit main article overfitting the blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is 91 10 93 other limitations and vulnerabilities edit learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses 91 111 93 a real world example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often don t primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies 91 112 93 91 113 93 adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from non pattern perturbations some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification 91 citation needed 93 machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and or evasion via adversarial machine learning 91 114 93 researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying e g for categories spam and well visible not spam of posts machine learning models which are often developed and or trained by third parties parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of data software transparency is provided possibly including white box access 91 115 93 91 116 93 91 117 93 model assessments edit classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 2 3 training set and 1 3 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the k fold cross validation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k 1 subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and cross validation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy 91 118 93 in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators the total operating characteristic toc is an effective method to express a model s diagnostic ability toc shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc and roc s associated area under the curve auc 91 119 93 ethics edit see also ai control problem and toronto declaration machine learning poses a host of ethical questions systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices 91 120 93 for example in 1988 the uk s commission for racial equality found that st george s medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to be either women or had non european sounding names 91 100 93 using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants 91 121 93 91 122 93 responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning ai can be well equipped to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information these decisions rely on the objectivity and logical reasoning 91 123 93 because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases 91 124 93 91 125 93 other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public s interest but as income generating machines 91 126 93 this is especially true in the united states where there is a long standing ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increase profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm s proprietary owners hold stakes there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated 91 127 93 hardware edit since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of non linear hidden units 91 128 93 by 2019 graphic processing units gpus often with ai specific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large scale commercial cloud ai 91 129 93 openai estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet 2012 to alphazero 2017 and found a 300 000 fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doubling time trendline of 3 4 months 91 130 93 91 131 93 neuromorphic physical neural networks edit a physical neural network or neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software based approaches more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse 91 132 93 91 133 93 embedded machine learning edit embedded machine learning is a sub field of machine learning where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers 91 134 93 91 135 93 91 136 93 running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets embedded machine learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration 91 137 93 91 138 93 using approximate computing 91 139 93 optimization of machine learning models and many more 91
