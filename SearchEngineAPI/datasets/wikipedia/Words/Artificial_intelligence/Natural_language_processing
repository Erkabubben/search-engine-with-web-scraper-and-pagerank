computers for the natural language processing done by the human brain see language processing in the brain an automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page an example of an application where natural language processing is a major component 91 1 93 natural language processing nlp is an interdisciplinary subfield of linguistics computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data the goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents including the contextual nuances of the language within them the technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition natural language understanding and natural language

published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language symbolic nlp 1950s early 1990s edit the premise of symbolic nlp is well summarized by john searle s chinese room experiment given a collection of rules e g a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other nlp tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s the georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty russian sentences into english the authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem 91 2 93 however real progress was much slower and after the alpac report in 1966 which found that ten year long research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were shrdlu a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and eliza a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist written by joseph weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 using almost no information about human thought or emotion eliza sometimes provided a startlingly human like interaction when the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base eliza might provide a generic response for example responding to my head hurts with why do you say your head hurts 1970s during the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured real world information into computer understandable data examples are margie schank 1975 sam cullingford 1978 pam wilensky 1978 talespin meehan 1976 qualm lehnert 1977 politics carbonell 1979 and plot

and jabberwacky an important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period 91 5 93 statistical nlp 1990s 2010s edit up to the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand written rules starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moore s law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics e g transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine learning approach to language processing 91 6 93 1990s many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in nlp occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government however most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems as a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s with the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data has become available since the mid 1990s research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi supervised learning algorithms such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non annotated data generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data however there is an enormous amount of non annotated data available including among other things the entire content of the world wide web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical neural nlp present edit in the 2010s representation learning and deep neural network style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing that popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques 91 7 93 91 8 93 can achieve state of the art results in many natural language tasks e g in language modeling 91 9 93 and parsing 91 10 93 91 11 93 this is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where nlp helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care 91 12 93 methods rules statistics neural networks edit in the early days many language processing systems were designed by symbolic methods i e the hand coding of a set of rules coupled with a dictionary lookup 91 13 93 91 14 93 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming more recent systems based on machine learning algorithms have many advantages over hand produced rules the learning procedures used during machine learning automatically focus on the most common cases whereas when writing rules by hand it is often not at all obvious where the effort should be directed automatic learning procedures can make use of statistical inference algorithms to produce models that are robust to unfamiliar input e g containing words or structures that have not been seen before and to erroneous input e g with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted generally handling such input gracefully with handwritten rules or more generally creating systems of handwritten rules that make soft decisions is extremely difficult error prone and time consuming systems based on automatically learning the rules can be made more accurate simply by supplying more input data however systems based on handwritten rules can only be made more accurate by increasing the complexity of the rules which is a much more difficult task in particular there is a limit to the complexity of systems based on handwritten rules beyond which the systems become more and more unmanageable however creating more data to input to machine learning systems simply requires a corresponding increase in the number of man hours worked generally without significant increases in the complexity of the annotation process despite the popularity of machine learning in nlp research symbolic methods are still 2020 commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods e g for the machine translation of low resource languages such as provided by the apertium system for preprocessing in nlp pipelines e g tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of nlp pipelines e g for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses statistical methods edit since the so called statistical revolution 91 15 93 91 16 93 in the late 1980s and mid 1990s much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning the machine learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora the plural form of corpus is a set of documents possibly with human or computer annotations of typical real world examples many different classes of machine learning algorithms have been applied to natural language processing tasks these algorithms take as input a large set of features that are generated from the input data increasingly however research has focused on statistical models which make soft probabilistic decisions based on attaching real valued weights to each input feature complex valued embeddings 91 17 93 and neural networks in general have also been proposed for e g speech 91 18 93 such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system some of the earliest used machine learning algorithms such as decision trees produced systems of hard if then rules similar to existing hand written rules however part of speech tagging introduced the use of hidden markov models to natural language processing and increasingly research has focused on statistical models which make soft probabilistic decisions based on attaching real valued weights to the features making up the input data the cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input especially input that contains errors as is very common for real world data and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks since the neural turn statistical methods in nlp research have been largely replaced by neural networks however they continue to be relevant for contexts in which statistical interpretability and transparency is required neural networks edit further information artificial neural network a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since 2015 91 19 93 the field has thus largely abandoned statistical methods and shifted to neural networks for machine learning popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words and an increase in end to end learning of a higher level task e g question answering instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks e g part of speech tagging and dependency parsing in some areas this shift has entailed substantial changes in how nlp systems are designed such that deep neural network based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing for instance the term neural machine translation nmt emphasizes the fact that deep learning based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence to sequence transformations obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation smt common nlp tasks edit the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct real world applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below text and speech processing edit optical character recognition ocr given an image representing printed text determine the corresponding text speech recognition given a sound clip of a person or people speaking determine the textual representation of the speech this is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed ai complete see above in natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition see below in most spoken languages the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process also given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent speech segmentation given a sound clip of a person or people speaking separate it into words a subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it text to speech given a text transform those units and produce a spoken representation text to speech can be used to aid the visually impaired 91 20 93 word segmentation tokenization separate a chunk of continuous text into separate words for a language like english this is fairly trivial since words are usually separated by spaces however some written languages like chinese japanese and thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words bow creation in data mining morphological analysis edit lemmatization the task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form but in this case the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form 91 21 93 morphological segmentation separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes the difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology i e the structure of words of the language being considered english has fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word e g open opens opened opening as separate words in languages such as turkish or meitei 91 22 93 a highly agglutinated indian language however such an approach is not possible as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms part of speech tagging given a sentence determine the part of speech pos for each word many words especially common ones can serve as multiple parts of speech for example book can be a noun the book on the table or verb to book a flight set can be a noun verb or adjective and out can be any of at least five different parts of speech stemming the process of reducing inflected or sometimes derived words to a base form e g close will be the root for closed closing close closer etc stemming yields similar results as lemmatization but does so on grounds of rules not a dictionary syntactic analysis edit grammar induction 91 23 93 generate a formal grammar that describes a language s syntax sentence breaking also known as sentence boundary disambiguation given a chunk of text find the sentence boundaries sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks but these same characters can serve other purposes e g marking abbreviations parsing determine the parse tree grammatical analysis of a given sentence the grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses perhaps surprisingly for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human there are two primary types of parsing dependency parsing and constituency parsing dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence marking things like primary objects and predicates whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context free grammar pcfg see also stochastic grammar lexical semantics of individual words in context edit lexical semantics what is the computational meaning of individual words in context distributional semantics how can we learn semantic representations from data named entity recognition ner given a stream of text determine which items in the text map to proper names such as people or places and what the type of each such name is e g person location organization although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as english this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity and in any case is often inaccurate or insufficient for example the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized and named entities often span several words only some of which are capitalized furthermore many other languages in non western scripts e g chinese or arabic do not have any capitalization at all and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names for example german capitalizes all nouns regardless of whether they are names and french and spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives sentiment analysis see also multimodal sentiment analysis extract subjective information usually from a set of documents often using online reviews to determine polarity about specific objects it is especially useful for identifying trends of public opinion in social media for marketing terminology extraction the goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus word sense disambiguation wsd many words have more than one meaning we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context for this problem we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses e g from a dictionary or an online resource such as wordnet entity linking many words typically proper names refer to named entities here we have to select the entity a famous individual a location a company etc which is referred to in context relational semantics semantics of individual sentences edit relationship extraction given a chunk of text identify the relationships among named entities e g who is married to whom semantic parsing given a piece of text typically a sentence produce a formal representation of its semantics either as a graph e g in amr parsing or in accordance with a logical formalism e g in drt parsing this challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary nlp tasks from semantics e g semantic role labelling word sense disambiguation and can be extended to include full fledged discourse analysis e g discourse analysis coreference see natural language understanding below semantic role labelling see also implicit semantic role labelling below given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates e g verbal frames then identify and classify the frame elements semantic roles discourse semantics beyond individual sentences edit coreference resolution given a sentence or larger chunk of text determine which words mentions refer to the same objects entities anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer the more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so called bridging relationships involving referring expressions for example in a sentence such as he entered john s house through the front door the front door is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of john s house rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to discourse analysis this rubric includes several related tasks one task is discourse parsing i e identifying the discourse structure of a connected text i e the nature of the discourse relationships between sentences e g elaboration explanation contrast another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text e g yes no question content question statement assertion etc implicit semantic role labelling given a single sentence identify and disambiguate semantic predicates e g verbal frames and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence see semantic role labelling above then identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified and resolve the former against the local text a closely related task is zero anaphora resolution i e the extension of coreference resolution to pro drop languages recognizing textual entailment given two text fragments determine if one being true entails the other entails the other s negation or allows the other to be either true or false 91 24 93 topic segmentation and recognition given a chunk of text separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic and identify the topic of the segment argument mining the goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs 91 25 93 such argumentative structures include the premise conclusions the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument or the main and counter argument within discourse 91 26 93 91 27 93 higher level nlp applications edit automatic summarization text summarization produce a readable summary of a chunk of text often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type such as research papers articles in the financial section of a newspaper book generation not an nlp task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other nlp tasks is the creation of full fledged books the first machine generated book was created by a rule based system in 1984 racter the policeman s beard is half constructed 91 28 93 the first published work by a neural network was published in 2018 1 the road marketed as a novel contains sixty million words both these systems are basically elaborate but non sensical semantics free language models the first machine generated science book was published in 2019 beta writer lithium ion batteries springer cham 91 29 93 unlike racter and 1 the road this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization dialogue management computer systems intended to converse with a human document ai a document ai platform sits on top of the nlp technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence machine learning or nlp to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types nlp powered document ai enables non technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents for example lawyers business analysts and accountants 91 30 93 grammatical error correction grammatical error detection and correction involves a great band width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis phonology orthography morphology syntax semantics pragmatics grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire english as a second language it has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011 91 31 93 91 32 93 91 33 93 as far as orthography morphology syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as gpt 2 this can now 2019 be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications machine translation automatically translate text from one human language to another this is one of the most difficult problems and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed ai complete i e requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess grammar semantics facts about the real world etc to solve properly natural language generation nlg convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language natural language understanding nlu convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions an explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed world assumption cwa vs open world assumption or subjective yes no vs objective true false is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization 91 34 93 question answering given a human language question determine its answer typical questions have a specific right answer such as what is the capital of canada but sometimes open ended questions are also considered such as what is the meaning of life text to image generation given a description of an image generate an image that matches the description 91 35 93 text to scene generation given a description of a scene generate a 3d model of the scene 91 36 93 91 37 93 text to video given a description of a video generate a video that matches the description 91 38 93 91 39 93 general tendencies and possible future directions edit based on long standing trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of nlp as of 2020 three trends among the topics of the long standing series of conll shared tasks can be observed 91

edit most higher level nlp applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of nlp see trends among conll shared tasks above cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses 91 41 93 cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes 91 42 93 cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics 91 43 93 especially during the age of symbolic nlp the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing nlp algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics 91 44 93 with two defining aspects apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author 91 45 93 for example consider the english word big when used in a comparison that is a big tree the author s intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience when used metaphorically tomorrow is a big day the author s intent to imply importance the intent behind other usages like in she is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive nlp algorithm alike without additional information assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed e g by means of a probabilistic context free grammar pcfg the mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in us 32 patent 9269353 160 r m m t o k e n n p m m t o k e n n x00d7 1 2 d x2211 i x2212 d d p m m t o k e n n x2212 1 x00d7 p f t o k e n n t o k e n n x2212 1 i displaystyle
