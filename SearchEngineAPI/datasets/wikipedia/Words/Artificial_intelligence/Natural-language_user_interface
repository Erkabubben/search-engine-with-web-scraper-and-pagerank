natural language user interface from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search natural language user interface lui or nlui is a type of computer human interface where linguistic phenomena such as verbs phrases and clauses act as ui controls for creating selecting and modifying data in software applications in interface design natural language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use but most suffer the challenges to understanding wide varieties of ambiguous input 91 1 93 natural language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics an intuitive general natural language interface is one of the active goals of the semantic web text interfaces are natural to varying degrees many formal un natural programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language likewise a traditional keyword search engine could be described as a shallow natural language user interface

theory find targeted answers to user questions as opposed to keyword search for example when confronted with a question of the form which u s state has the highest income tax conventional search engines ignore the question and instead search on the keywords state income and tax natural language search on the other hand attempts to use natural language processing to understand the nature of the question and then to search and return a subset of the web that contains the answer to the question if it works results would have a higher relevance than results from a keyword search engine due to the question being included 91 citation needed 93 history edit prototype nl interfaces had already appeared in the late sixties and early seventies 91 2 93 shrdlu a natural language interface that

questions into prolog expressions which were evaluated against the prolog database the code of chat 80 was circulated widely and formed the basis of several other experimental nl interfaces an online

almost no information about human thought or emotion the doctor script sometimes provided a startlingly human like interaction an online demo is available on the lpa website 91 4 93 janus is also one

in the past led users to anthropomorphize the computer or at least to attribute more intelligence to machines than is warranted on the part of the user this has led to unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system such expectations will make it difficult to learn the restrictions of the system if users attribute too much capability to it and will ultimately lead to disappointment when the system fails to perform as expected as was the case in the ai winter of the 1970s and 80s a 1995 paper titled natural language interfaces to databases an introduction describes some challenges 91 2 93 modifier attachment the request list all employees in the company with a driving licence is ambiguous unless you know that companies can t have driving licences conjunction and disjunction list all applicants who live in california and arizona is ambiguous unless you know that a person can t live in two places at once anaphora resolution resolve what a user means by he she or it in a self referential query other goals to consider more generally are the speed and efficiency of the interface in all algorithms these two points are the main point that will determine if some methods are better than others and therefore have greater success in the market in addition localisation across multiple language sites requires extra consideration this is based on differing sentence structure and language syntax variations between most languages finally regarding the methods used the main problem to be solved is creating a general algorithm that can recognize the entire spectrum of different voices while disregarding nationality gender or age the significant differences between the extracted features even from speakers who says the same word or phrase must be successfully overcome uses and applications edit the natural language interface gives rise to technology used for many different applications some of the main uses are dictation is the most common use for automated speech recognition asr systems today this includes medical transcriptions legal and business dictation and general word processing in some cases special vocabularies are used to increase the accuracy of the system command and control asr systems that are designed to perform functions and actions on the system are defined as command and control systems utterances like open netscape and start a new xterm will do just that telephony some pbx voice mail systems allow callers to speak commands instead of pressing buttons to send specific tones wearables because inputs are limited for wearable devices speaking is a natural possibility medical disabilities many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such as repetitive strain injuries rsi muscular dystrophy and many others for example people with difficulty hearing could use a system connected to their telephone to convert a caller s speech to text embedded applications some new cellular phones include c amp c speech recognition that allow utterances such as call home this may be a major factor in the future of automatic speech recognition and linux software development an integrated development environment can embed natural language interfaces to help developers 91 5 93 below are named and defined some of the applications that use natural language recognition and so have integrated utilities listed above ubiquity edit main article ubiquity firefox ubiquity an add on for mozilla firefox is a collection of quick and easy natural language derived commands that act as mashups of web services thus allowing users to get information and relate it to current and other webpages wolfram alpha edit main article wolfram alpha wolfram alpha is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine would 91 6 93 it was announced in march

system ios the application uses natural language processing to answer questions and make recommendations siri s marketing claims include that it adapts to a user s individual preferences over time and personalizes results and performs tasks such as making dinner reservations while trying to catch a cab 91 8 93 others edit ask com the original idea behind ask jeeves ask com was traditional keyword

search results web sites pages and content that it presented in a visually indexed format that is more aligned with initial human intent yebol used association ranking and clustering algorithms to
