transfer learning from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search applying previously learned knowledge to new problems transfer learning tl is a research problem in machine learning ml that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem 91 1 93 for example knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks this area of research bears some relation to the long history of psychological literature on transfer of learning although practical ties between the two fields are limited from the practical standpoint reusing or transferring information from previously learned tasks for the learning of new tasks has the potential to significantly improve the sample efficiency of a reinforcement learning agent 91 2 93 contents 1 history 2 definition 3 applications 4 softwares 5 see also 6 references 7 sources history edit this section may lend undue weight to

fulgosi published a paper explicitly addressing transfer learning in neural networks training 91 3 93 91 4 93 the paper gives a mathematical and geometrical model of transfer learning in 1981 a report was given on the application of transfer learning in training a neural network on a dataset of images representing letters of computer terminals both positive and negative transfer learning was experimentally demonstrated 91 5 93 in 1993 lorien pratt published a paper on transfer in machine learning formulating the discriminability based transfer dbt algorithm 91 6 93 in 1997 pratt and sebastian thrun guest edited a special issue of machine learning devoted to transfer learning 91 7 93 and by 1998 the field had advanced to include multi task learning 91 8 93 along with a more formal analysis of its theoretical foundations 91 9 93 learning to learn 91 10 93 edited by thrun and pratt is a 1998 review of the subject transfer learning has also been applied in cognitive science with pratt also guest editing an issue of connection science on reuse of neural networks through transfer in 1996 91 11 93 andrew ng said in his nips 2016 tutorial 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 that tl will be the next driver of ml commercial success after supervised learning to highlight the importance of tl in the 2020 paper rethinking pre training and self training 91 15 93 zoph et al show that pre training can hurt accuracy and advocate self training instead definition edit the definition of transfer learning is given in terms of domains and tasks a domain d displaystyle mathcal d consists of a feature space x displaystyle mathcal x and a marginal probability distribution p x displaystyle p x where x x 1 x n x2208 x displaystyle x x 1 x n in mathcal x given a specific domain d x p x

mathcal y the function f displaystyle f is used to predict the corresponding label f x displaystyle f x of a new instance x displaystyle x this task denoted by t y f x displaystyle mathcal t mathcal y

natures transfer learning is possible between electromyographic emg signals from the muscles and classifying the behaviors of electroencephalographic eeg brainwaves from the gesture recognition domain to the mental state recognition domain it was also noted that this relationship worked vice versa showing that eeg can likewise be used to classify emg 91 27 93 the experiments noted that the accuracy of neural networks and convolutional neural networks were improved 91 28 93 through transfer learning at both the first epoch prior to any learning ie compared to standard random weight distribution and the asymptote the end of the learning process that is algorithms are improved by exposure to another domain moreover the end user of a pre trained model can change the structure of fully connected layers to achieve superior performance 91 29 93 in the domain of machine learning on code 91 30 93 it has been shown that transfer learning is useful for automatically repairing security
