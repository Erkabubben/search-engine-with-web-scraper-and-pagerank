decision tree pruning from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from pruning algorithm jump to navigation jump to search before and after pruning pruning is a data compression technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that are non critical and redundant to classify instances pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting one of the questions that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree a tree that is too large risks overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples a small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space however it is hard to tell when a tree algorithm should stop because it is impossible to tell if the addition of a single extra node will dramatically decrease error this problem is known as the horizon effect a common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information 91 1 93 pruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross validation set there are many techniques for tree pruning that differ in the measurement that is used to optimize

external links techniques edit pruning processes can be divided into two types pre and post pruning pre pruning procedures prevent a complete induction of the training set by replacing a stop criterion in the induction algorithm e g max tree depth or information gain attr gt mingain pre pruning methods are considered to be more efficient because they do not induce an entire set but rather trees remain small from the start prepruning methods share a common problem the horizon effect this is to be understood as the undesired premature termination of the induction by the stop criterion post pruning or just pruning is the most common way of simplifying trees here nodes and subtrees are replaced with leaves to reduce complexity pruning can not only significantly reduce the size but also improve the classification accuracy of unseen objects it may be the case that the accuracy of the assignment on the train set deteriorates but the accuracy of the classification properties of the tree increases overall the procedures are differentiated on the basis of their approach in the tree top down or bottom up bottom up pruning edit these procedures start at the last node in the tree the lowest point following recursively upwards they determine the relevance of each individual node if the relevance for the classification is not given the node is dropped or replaced by a leaf the advantage is that no relevant sub trees can be lost with this method these methods include reduced error pruning rep minimum cost complexity pruning mccp or minimum error pruning mep top down pruning edit in contrast to the bottom up method this method starts at the root of the tree following the structure below a relevance check is carried out which decides whether a node is relevant for the classification of all n items or not by pruning the tree at an inner node it can happen that an entire sub tree regardless of its relevance is dropped one of these representatives is pessimistic error pruning pep which brings quite good results with unseen items pruning algorithms edit reduced error pruning edit one of the simplest forms of pruning is reduced error pruning starting at the leaves each node is replaced with its most popular class if the prediction accuracy is not affected then the change is kept while somewhat naive reduced error pruning has the advantage of simplicity and speed cost complexity pruning edit cost complexity pruning generates a series of trees t 0 x2026 t m displaystyle t 0 dots t m where t 0 displaystyle t 0 is the initial tree and t m displaystyle t m is the root alone at step i displaystyle i the tree is created by removing a subtree from tree i x2212 1 displaystyle i 1 and replacing it with a leaf node with value chosen as in the tree building algorithm the subtree that is removed is chosen as follows define the error rate of tree t displaystyle t over data set s displaystyle s as err x2061 t s displaystyle operatorname err t s the subtree
