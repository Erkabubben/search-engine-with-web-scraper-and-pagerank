means ends analysis from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from means ends analysis jump to navigation jump to search problem solving technique means ends analysis 91 1 93 mea is a problem solving technique used commonly in artificial intelligence ai for limiting search in ai programs it is also a technique used at least since the 1950s as a creativity tool most frequently mentioned in engineering books on design methods mea is also related to means ends chain approach used commonly in consumer behavior analysis 91 2 93 it is also a way to clarify one s thoughts when embarking on a mathematical proof contents 1 problem solving as search 2 how means ends analysis works 3 some ai systems using mea 4 see also 5 references problem solving as search edit an important aspect of intelligent behavior as studied in ai is goal based problem solving a framework in which the solution to a problem can be described by finding a sequence of actions that lead to a desirable goal a goal seeking system is supposed to be connected to its outside environment by sensory channels through which it receives information about the environment and motor channels through which it acts on the environment the term afferent is used to describe inward sensory flows and efferent is used to describe outward motor commands in addition the system has some means of storing in a memory information about the state of the environment afferent information and information about actions efferent information ability to attain goals depends on building up associations simple or complex between particular changes in states and particular actions that will bring these changes about search is the process of discovery and assembly of sequences of actions that will lead from a given state to a desired state while this strategy may be appropriate for machine learning and problem solving it is not always suggested for humans e g cognitive load theory and its implications how means ends analysis works edit the mea technique is a strategy to control search in problem solving given a current state and a goal state an action is chosen which will reduce the difference between the two the action is performed on the current state to produce a new state and the process is recursively applied to this new state and the goal state note that in order for mea to be effective the goal seeking system must have a means of associating to any kind of detectable difference those actions that are relevant to reducing that difference it must also have means for detecting the progress it is making the changes in the differences between the actual and the desired state as some attempted sequences of actions may fail and hence some alternate sequences may be tried when knowledge is available concerning the importance of differences the most important difference is selected first to further improve the average performance of mea over other brute force search strategies however even without the ordering of differences according to importance mea improves over other search heuristics again in the average case by focusing the problem solving on the actual differences between the current state and that of the goal some ai systems using mea edit the mea technique as a problem solving strategy was first introduced in 1961 by allen newell and herbert a simon in their computer problem solving program general problem solver gps 91 3 93 91 4 93 in that implementation the correspondence between differences and actions also called operators is provided a priori as knowledge in the system in gps this knowledge was in the form of table of connections when the action and side effects of applying an operator are penetrable 91 clarification needed 93 the search may select the relevant operators by inspection of the operators and do without a table of connections this latter case of which the canonical example is strips an automated planning computer program allows task independent correlation of differences to the operators which reduce them prodigy a problem solver developed in a larger learning assisted automated planning project started at carnegie mellon university by jaime carbonell steven minton and craig knoblock is another system that used mea professor morten lind at technical university of denmark has developed a tool called multilevel flow modeling mfm it performs means ends based diagnostic reasoning for industrial control and automation systems 91 citation needed 93 see also edit causal layered analysis knowledge representation
