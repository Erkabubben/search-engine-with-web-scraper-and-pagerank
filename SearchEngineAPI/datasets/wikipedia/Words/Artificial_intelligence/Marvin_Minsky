activist 91 15 93 91 16 93 91 17 93 his family was jewish he attended the ethical culture fieldston school and the bronx high school of science he later attended phillips academy in andover massachusetts he then served in the us navy from 1944 to 1945 he received a b a in mathematics from harvard university in 1950 and a ph d in mathematics from princeton university in 1954 his doctoral dissertation was titled theory of neural analog reinforcement systems and its application to the brain model problem 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 he was a junior fellow of the harvard society of fellows from 1954 to 1957 91 21 93 91 22 93 he was on the mit faculty from 1958 to his death he joined the staff at mit lincoln laboratory in 1958 and a year later he and john mccarthy initiated what is as of 2019 91 update 93 named the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory 91 23 93 91 24 93 he was the toshiba professor of media arts and sciences and professor of electrical engineering and computer science contributions in computer science edit 3d profile of a coin partial measured with a modern confocal white light microscope minsky s inventions include the first head mounted graphical display 1963 91 25 93 and the confocal microscope 91 2 93 91 note 1 93 1957 a predecessor to today s widely used confocal laser scanning microscope he developed with seymour papert the first logo turtle minsky also built in 1951 the first randomly wired neural network learning machine snarc in 1962 minsky worked in small universal turing machines and published his well known 7 state 4 symbol machine 91 26 93 minsky s book perceptrons written with seymour papert attacked the work of frank rosenblatt and became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks the book is the center of a controversy in the history of ai as some claim it to have had great importance in discouraging research of neural networks in the 1970s and contributing to the so called ai winter 91 27 93 he also founded several other ai models his paper a framework for representing knowledge 91 28 93 created a new paradigm in knowledge representation while his perceptrons is now more a historical than practical book the theory of frames is in wide use 91 29 93 minsky also wrote of the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans permitting communication 91 30 93 in the early 1970s at the mit artificial intelligence lab minsky and papert started developing what came to be known as the society of mind theory the theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non intelligent parts minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm a video camera and a computer to build with children s blocks in 1986 minsky published the society of mind a comprehensive book on the theory which unlike most of his previously published work was written for the general public the ma 3 robotic manipulator arm on display at mit museum general view the belgrade hand in november 2006 minsky published the emotion machine a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones recent drafts of the book are freely available from his webpage 91 31 93 role in popular culture edit minsky was an adviser 91 32 93 on stanley kubrick s movie 2001 a space odyssey one of the movie s characters victor kaminski was named in minsky s honor 91 33 93 minsky is mentioned explicitly in arthur c clarke s derivative novel of the same name where he is portrayed as achieving a crucial break through in artificial intelligence in the then future 1980s paving the way for hal 9000 in the early 21st century in the 1980s minsky and good had shown how artificial neural networks could be generated automatically self replicated in accordance with any arbitrary learning program artificial brains could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human brain in any given case the precise details would never be known and even if they were they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding 91 34 93 in fargo season 3 episode 3 titled the law of non contradiction at least two allusions are made to minsky the first through the depiction of a useless machine a device that was invented by minsky as a philosophical joke the second through the depiction of an animation of a robot called minsky a character in a sci fi novel called the planet wyh personal life edit the minskytron or three position display running on the computer history museum s pdp 1 2007 in 1952 minsky married pediatrician gloria rudisch together they had three children 91 35 93 minsky was a talented improvisational pianist 91 36 93 who published musings on the relations between music and psychology opinions edit minsky was an atheist 91 37 93 he was a signatory to the scientists open letter on cryonics 91 38 93 he was a critic of the loebner prize for conversational robots 91 39 93 and argued that a fundamental difference between humans and machines was that while humans are machines they are machines in which intelligence emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semi autonomous agents that comprise the brain 91 40 93 he argued that somewhere down the line some computers will become more intelligent than most people but that it was very hard to predict how fast progress would be 91 41 93 he cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of earth s resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal 91 42 93 but believed that such negative scenarios are hard to take seriously because he felt confident that ai would go through a lot of testing before being deployed 91 43 93 association with jeffrey epstein edit minsky received a 100 000 research grant from jeffrey epstein in 2002 four years before epstein s first arrest for sex offenses it was the first from epstein to mit minsky received no further research grants from him 91 44 93 91 45 93 minsky organized two academic symposia on epstein s private island little saint james one in 2002 and another in 2011 after epstein was a registered sex offender 91 46 93 virginia giuffre testified in a 2015 deposition in her defamation lawsuit against epstein s associate ghislaine maxwell that maxwell directed her to have sex with minsky among others there has been no allegation that sex between them took place nor a lawsuit against minsky s estate 91 47 93 minsky s widow gloria rudisch says that he could not have had sex with any of the women at epstein s residences as they were always together during all of the visits to epstein s residences 91 48 93 91 49 93 death edit in january 2016 minsky died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 88 91
