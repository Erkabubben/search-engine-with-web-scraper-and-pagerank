sentiment analysis from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search marketing and customer service tool sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining or emotion ai is the use of natural language processing text analysis computational linguistics and biometrics to systematically identify extract quantify and study affective states and subjective information sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses online and social media and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine with the rise of deep language models such as roberta also more difficult data domains can be analyzed e g news texts where authors typically express their opinion sentiment less explicitly 91 1 93 contents 1 examples 1 1 simple cases 1 2 more challenging examples 2 types 2 1 subjectivity objectivity identification 2 2 feature aspect based 2 3 intensity

plot twists negative term used in a positive sense in certain domains you should see their decadent dessert menu attitudinal term has shifted polarity recently in certain domains i love my mobile but would not recommend it to any of my colleagues qualified positive sentiment difficult to categorise next week s gig will be right koide9 quoi de neuf french for what s new newly minted terms can be highly attitudinal but volatile in polarity and often out of known vocabulary types edit a basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the polarity of a given text at the document sentence or feature aspect level whether the expressed opinion in a document a sentence or an entity feature aspect is positive negative or neutral advanced beyond polarity sentiment classification looks for instance at emotional states such as enjoyment anger disgust sadness fear and surprise 91 2 93 precursors to sentimental analysis include the general inquirer 91 3 93 which provided hints toward quantifying patterns in text and separately psychological research that examined a person s psychological state based on analysis of their verbal behavior 91 4 93 subsequently the method described in a patent by volcani and fogel 91 5 93 looked specifically at sentiment and identified individual words and phrases in text with respect to different emotional scales a current system based on their work called effectcheck presents synonyms that can be used to increase or decrease the level of evoked emotion in each scale many other subsequent efforts were less sophisticated using a mere polar view of sentiment from positive to negative such as work by turney 91 6 93 and pang 91 7 93 who applied different methods for detecting the polarity of product reviews and movie reviews respectively this work is at the document level one can also classify a document s polarity on a multi way scale which was attempted by pang 91 8 93 and snyder 91 9 93 among others pang and lee 91 8 93 expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3 or a 4 star scale while snyder 91 9 93 performed an in depth analysis of restaurant reviews predicting ratings for various aspects of the given restaurant such as the food and atmosphere on a five star scale first steps to bringing together various approaches learning lexical knowledge based etc were taken in the 2004 aaai spring symposium where linguists computer scientists and other interested researchers first aligned interests and proposed shared tasks and benchmark data sets for the systematic computational research on affect appeal subjectivity and sentiment in text 91 10 93 even though in most statistical classification methods the neutral class is ignored under the assumption that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier several researchers suggest that as in every polarity problem three categories must be identified moreover it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the max entropy 91 11 93 and svms 91 12 93 can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification there are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class either the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments or it builds a three way classification in one step 91 13 93 this second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories e g naive bayes classifiers as implemented by the nltk whether and how to use a neutral class depends on the nature of the data if the data is clearly clustered into neutral negative and positive language it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments if in contrast the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles a different method for determining sentiment is the use of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative neutral or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a 10 to 10 scale most negative up to most positive or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as 4 this makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment usually on the level of the sentence when a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 this allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it words for example that intensify relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score alternatively texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text 91 17 93 there are various other types of sentiment analysis like aspect based sentiment analysis grading sentiment analysis positive negative neutral multilingual sentiment analysis and detection of emotions subjectivity objectivity identification edit this task is commonly defined as classifying a given text usually a sentence into one of two classes objective or subjective 91 18 93 this problem can sometimes be more difficult than polarity classification 91 19 93 the subjectivity of words and phrases may depend on their context and an objective document may contain subjective sentences e g a news article quoting people s opinions moreover as mentioned by su 91 20 93 results are largely dependent on the definition of subjectivity used when annotating texts however pang 91 21 93 showed that removing objective sentences from a document before classifying its polarity helped improve performance subjective and objective identification emerging subtasks of sentiment analysis to use syntactic semantic features and machine learning knowledge to identify a sentence or document are facts or opinions awareness of recognizing factual and opinions is not recent having possibly first presented by carbonell at yale university in 1979 91 clarify 93 the term objective refers to the incident carrying factual information 91 22 93 example of an objective sentence to be elected president of the united states a candidate must be at least thirty five years of age the term subjective describes the incident contains non factual information in various forms such as personal opinions judgment and predictions also known as private states mentioned by quirk et al 91 23 93 in the example down below it reflects a private states we americans 160 moreover the target entity commented by the opinions can take several forms from tangible product to intangible topic matters stated in liu 2010 91 24 93 furthermore three types of attitudes were observed by liu 2010 1 positive opinions 2 neutral opinions and 3 negative opinions 91 24 93 example of a subjective sentence we americans need to elect a president who is mature and who is able to make wise decisions this analysis is a classification problem 91 25 93 each class s collections of words or phrase indicators are defined for to locate desirable patterns on unannotated text for subjective expression a different word list has been created lists of subjective indicators in words or phrases have been developed by multiple researchers in the linguist and natural language processing field states in riloff et al 2003 91 26 93 a dictionary of extraction rules has to be created for measuring given expressions over the years in subjective detection the features extraction progression from curating features by hand to automated features learning at the moment automated learning methods can further separate into supervised and unsupervised machine learning patterns extraction with machine learning process annotated and unannotated text have been explored extensively by academic researchers however researchers recognized several challenges in developing fixed sets of rules for expressions respectably much of the challenges in rule development stems from the nature of textual information six challenges have been recognized by several researchers 1 metaphorical expressions 2 discrepancies in writings 3 context sensitive 4 represented words with fewer usages 5 time sensitive and 6 ever growing volume metaphorical expressions the text contains metaphoric expression may impact on the performance on the extraction 91 27 93 besides metaphors take in different forms which may have been contributed to the increase in detection discrepancies in writings for the text obtained from the internet the discrepancies in the writing style of targeted text data involve distinct writing genres and styles context sensitive classification may vary based on the subjectiveness or objectiveness of previous and following sentences 91 25 93 time sensitive attribute the task is challenged by some textual data s time sensitive attribute if a group of researchers wants to confirm a piece of fact in the news they need a longer time for cross validation than the news becomes outdated cue words with fewer usages ever growing volume the task is also challenged by the sheer volume of textual data the textual data s ever growing nature makes the task overwhelmingly difficult for the researchers to complete the task on time previously the research mainly focused on document level classification however classifying a document level suffers less accuracy as an article may have diverse types of expressions involved researching evidence suggests a set of news articles that are expected to dominate by the objective expression whereas the results show that it consisted of over 40 of subjective expression 91 22 93 to overcome those challenges researchers conclude that classifier efficacy depends on the precisions of patterns learner and the learner feeds with large volumes of annotated training data outperformed those trained on less comprehensive subjective features however one of the main obstacles to executing this type of work is to generate a big dataset of annotated sentences manually 160 the manual annotation method has been less favored than automatic learning for three reasons variations in comprehensions in the manual annotation task disagreement of whether one instance is subjective or objective may occur among annotators because of languages ambiguity human errors manual annotation task is a meticulous assignment it require intense concentration to finish time consuming manual annotation task is an assiduous work riloff 1996 show that a 160 texts cost 8 hours for one annotator to finish 91 28 93 all these mentioned reasons can impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of subjective and objective classification accordingly two bootstrapping methods were designed to learning linguistic patterns from unannotated text data both methods are starting with a handful of seed words and unannotated textual data meta bootstrapping by riloff and jones in 1999 91 29 93 level one generate extraction patterns based on the pre defined rules and the extracted patterns by the number of seed words each pattern holds leve two top 5 words will be marked and add to the dictionary repeat basilisk bootstrapping approach to semantic lexicon induction using semantic knowledge by thelen and riloff 91 30 93 step one generate extraction patterns step two move best patterns from pattern pool to candidate word pool step three top 10 words will be marked and add to the dictionary repeat overall these algorithms highlight the need for automatic pattern recognition and extraction in subjective and objective task subjective and object classifier can enhance the serval applications of natural language processing one of the classifier s primary benefits is that it popularized the practice of data driven decision making processes in various industries 160 according to liu the applications of subjective and objective identification have been implemented in business advertising sports and social science 91 31 93 online review classification in the business industry the classifier helps the company better understand the feedbacks on product and reasonings behind the reviews stock price prediction in the finance industry the classier aids the prediction model by process auxiliary information from social media and other textual information from the internet previous studies on japanese stock price conducted by dong et al indicates that model with subjective and objective module may perform better than those without this part 91 32 93 social media analysis students feedback classification 91 33 93 document summarising the classifier can extract target specified comments and gathering opinions made by one particular entity complex question answering the classifier can dissect the complex questions by classing the language subject or objective and focused target in the research yu et al 2003 the researcher developed a sentence and document level clustered that identity opinion pieces 91 34 93 domain specific applications email analysis the subjective and objective classifier detects spam by tracing language patterns with target words feature aspect based edit it refers to determining the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities e g of a cell phone a digital camera or a bank 91 35 93 a feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity e g the screen of a cell phone the service for a restaurant or the picture quality of a camera the advantage of feature based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest different features can generate different sentiment responses for example a hotel can have a convenient location but mediocre food 91 36 93 this problem involves several sub problems e g identifying relevant entities extracting their features aspects and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature aspect is positive negative or neutral 91 37 93 the automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods with topic modeling 91 38 93 91 39 93 or with deep learning 91 40 93 91 41 93 more detailed discussions about this level of sentiment analysis can be found in liu s work 91 24 93 intensity ranking edit emotions and sentiments are subjective in nature the degree of emotions sentiments expressed in a given text at the document sentence or feature aspect level to what degree of intensity is expressed in the opinion of a document a sentence or an entity differs on a case to case basis 91 42 93 however predicting only the emotion and sentiment does not always convey complete information the degree or level of emotions and sentiments often plays a crucial role in understanding the exact feeling within a single class e g good versus awesome some methods leverage a stacked ensemble method 91 43 93 for predicting intensity for emotion and sentiment by combining the outputs obtained and using deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks 91 44 93 long short term memory networks and gated recurrent units 91 45 93 methods and features edit existing approaches to sentiment analysis can be grouped into three main categories knowledge based techniques statistical methods and hybrid approaches 91 46 93 knowledge based techniques classify text by affect categories based on the presence of unambiguous affect words such as happy sad afraid and bored 91 47 93 some knowledge bases not only list obvious affect words but also assign arbitrary words a probable affinity to particular emotions 91 48 93 statistical methods leverage elements from machine learning such as latent semantic analysis support vector machines bag of words pointwise mutual information for semantic orientation 91 6 93 semantic space models or word embedding models 91 49 93 and deep learning more sophisticated methods try to detect the holder of a sentiment i e the person who maintains that affective state and the target i e the entity about which the affect is felt 91 50 93 to mine the opinion in context and get the feature about which the speaker has opined the grammatical relationships of words are used grammatical dependency relations are obtained by deep parsing of the text 91 51 93 hybrid approaches leverage both machine learning and elements from knowledge representation such as ontologies and semantic networks in order to detect semantics that are expressed in a subtle manner e g through the analysis of concepts that do not explicitly convey relevant information but which are implicitly linked to other concepts that do so 91 52 93 open source software tools as well as range of free and paid sentiment analysis tools deploy machine learning statistics and natural language processing techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts including web pages online news internet discussion groups online reviews web blogs and social media 91 53 93 knowledge based systems on the other hand make use of publicly available resources to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts the system can help perform affective commonsense reasoning 91 54 93 sentiment analysis can also be performed on visual content i e images and videos see multimodal sentiment analysis one of the first approaches in this direction is sentibank 91 55 93 utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content in addition the vast majority of sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag of words model which disregards context grammar and even word order approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result 91 56 93 but they incur an additional annotation overhead a human analysis component is required in sentiment analysis as automated systems are not able to analyze historical tendencies of the individual commenter or the platform and are often classified incorrectly in their expressed sentiment automation impacts approximately 23 of comments that are correctly classified by humans 91 57 93 however humans often disagree and it is argued that the inter human agreement provides an upper bound that automated sentiment classifiers can eventually reach 91 58 93 evaluation edit the accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is in principle how well it agrees with human judgments this is usually measured by variant measures based on precision and recall over the two target categories of negative and positive texts however according to research human raters typically only agree about 80 91 59 93 of the time see inter rater reliability thus a program that achieves 70 accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans even though such accuracy may not sound impressive if a program were right 100 of the time humans would still disagree with it about 20 of the time since they disagree that much about any answer 91 60 93 on the other hand computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors and thus the figures are not entirely comparable for instance a computer system will have trouble with negations exaggerations jokes or sarcasm which typically are easy to handle for a human reader some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human in general the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question mostly since the simple one dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying about the effect of public discourse on e g brand or corporate reputation 91 61 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 to better fit market needs evaluation of sentiment analysis has moved to more task based measures formulated together with representatives from pr agencies and market research professionals the focus in e g the replab evaluation data set is less on the content of the text under consideration and more on the effect of the text in question on brand reputation 91 64 93 91 65 93 91 66 93 because evaluation of sentiment analysis is becoming more and more task based each implementation needs a separate training model to get a more accurate representation of sentiment for a given data set web 2 0 edit see also reputation management web 2 0 and web mining the rise of social media such as blogs and social networks has fueled interest in sentiment analysis with the proliferation of reviews ratings recommendations and other forms of online expression online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products identify new opportunities and manage their reputations as businesses look to automate the process of filtering out the noise understanding the conversations identifying the relevant content and actioning it appropriately many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis 91 67 93 further complicating the matter is the rise of anonymous social media platforms such as 4chan and reddit 91 68 93 if web 2 0 was all about democratizing publishing then the next stage of the web may well be based on democratizing data mining of all the content that is getting published 91 69 93 one step towards this aim is accomplished in research several research teams in universities around the world currently focus on understanding the dynamics of sentiment in e communities through sentiment analysis 91 70 93 the cyberemotions project for instance recently identified the role of negative emotions in driving social networks discussions 91 71 93 the problem is that most sentiment analysis algorithms use simple terms to express sentiment about a product or service however cultural factors linguistic nuances and differing contexts make it extremely difficult to turn a string of written text into a simple pro or con sentiment 91 67 93 the fact that humans often disagree on the sentiment of text illustrates how big a task it is for computers to get this right the shorter the string of text the harder it becomes even though short text strings might be a problem sentiment analysis within microblogging has shown that twitter can be seen as a valid online indicator of political sentiment tweets political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to parties and politicians political positions indicating that the content of twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape 91 72 93 furthermore sentiment analysis on twitter has also been shown to capture the public mood behind human reproduction cycles globally 91 73 93 as well as other problems of public health relevance such as adverse drug reactions 91 74 93 while sentiment analysis has been popular for domains where authors express their opinion rather explicitly the movie is awesome such as social media and product reviews only recently robust methods were devised for other domains where sentiment is strongly implicit or indirect for example in news articles mostly due to the expected journalistic objectivity journalists often describe actions or events rather than directly stating the polarity of a piece of information earlier approaches using dictionaries or shallow machine learning features were unable to catch the meaning between the lines but recently researchers have proposed a deep learning based approach and dataset that is able to analyze sentiment in news articles 91 1 93 application in recommender systems edit see also recommender system for a recommender system sentiment analysis has been proven to be a valuable technique a recommender system aims to predict the preference for an item of a target user mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set for example collaborative filtering works on the rating matrix and content based filtering works on the meta data of the items in many social networking services or e commerce websites users can provide text review comment or feedback to the items these user generated text provide a rich source of user s sentiment opinions about numerous products and items potentially for an item such text can reveal both the related feature aspects of the item and the users sentiments on each feature 91 75 93 the item s feature aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta data in content based filtering but the former are more valuable for the recommender system since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user s experience on the item while the meta data of the item usually provided by the producers instead of consumers may ignore features that are concerned by the users for different items with common features a user may give different sentiments also a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users users sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi dimensional rating score reflecting their preference on the items based on the feature aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user generated text a hybrid recommender system can be constructed 91 76 93 there are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user the first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user s preferred items 91 77 93 while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features for a preferred item it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility so these items will also likely to be preferred by the user on the other hand for a shared feature of two candidate items other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while giving negative sentiment to another clearly the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user based on these two motivations a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item 91 76 93 except for the difficulty of the sentiment analysis itself applying sentiment analysis on reviews or feedback also faces the challenge of spam and biased reviews one direction of work is focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review 91 78 93 review or feedback poorly written is hardly helpful for recommender system besides a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written researchers also found that long and short forms of user generated text should be treated differently an interesting result shows that short form reviews are sometimes more helpful than long form 91 79 93 because it is easier to filter out the noise in a short form text for the long form text the growing length of the text does not always bring a proportionate increase in the number of features or sentiments in the text lamba amp madhusudhan 91 80 93 introduce a nascent way to cater the information needs of today s library users by repackaging the results from sentiment analysis of social media platforms like twitter and provide it as a consolidated time based service in different formats further they propose a new way of conducting marketing in
