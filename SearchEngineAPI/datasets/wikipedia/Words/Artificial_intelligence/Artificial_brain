artificial brain from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search software and hardware with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or human brain an artificial brain or artificial mind is software and hardware with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or human brain 91 1 93 research investigating artificial brains and brain emulation plays three important roles in science an ongoing attempt by neuroscientists to understand how the human brain works known as cognitive neuroscience a thought experiment in the philosophy of artificial intelligence demonstrating that it is possible at least in theory to create a machine that has all the capabilities of a human being a long term project to create machines exhibiting behavior comparable to those of animals with complex central nervous system such as mammals and most particularly humans the ultimate goal of creating a machine exhibiting human like behavior or intelligence is sometimes called strong ai an example of the first objective is the project reported by aston university in birmingham england 91 2 93 where researchers are using biological cells to create neurospheres small clusters of neurons in order to develop new treatments for diseases including alzheimer s motor neurone and parkinson s disease the second objective is a reply to arguments such as john searle s chinese room argument hubert dreyfus s critique of ai or roger penrose s argument in the emperor s new mind these critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines one reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy this reply was made as early as 1950 by alan turing in his classic paper computing machinery and intelligence 91 note 1 93 the third objective is generally called artificial general intelligence by researchers 91 3 93 however ray kurzweil prefers the term strong ai in his book the singularity is near he focuses on whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains and claims on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend that this could be done by 2025 henry markram director of the blue brain project which is attempting brain emulation made a similar claim 2020 at the oxford ted conference in 2009 91 1 93 contents 1 approaches to brain simulation 2 artificial brain thought experiment 3 see also 4 notes 5 references 6 external links approaches to brain simulation edit estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels from ray kurzweil and anders sandberg and nick bostrom along with the fastest supercomputer from top500 mapped by year although direct human brain emulation using artificial neural networks on a high performance computing engine is a commonly discussed approach 91 4 93 there are other approaches an alternative artificial brain implementation could be based on holographic neural technology hnet non linear phase coherence decoherence principles the analogy has been made to quantum processes through the core synaptic algorithm which has strong similarities to the quantum mechanical wave equation evbrain 91 5 93 is a form of evolutionary software that can evolve brainlike neural networks such as the network immediately behind the retina in november 2008 ibm received a us 4 9 million grant from the pentagon for research into creating intelligent computers the blue brain project is being conducted with the assistance of ibm in lausanne 91 6 93 the project is based on the premise that it is possible to artificially link the neurons in the computer by placing thirty million synapses in their proper three dimensional position some proponents of strong ai speculated in 2009 that computers in connection with blue brain and soul catcher may exceed human intellectual capacity by around 2015 and that it is likely that we will be able to download the human brain at some time around 2050 91 7 93 while blue brain is able to represent complex neural connections on the large scale the project does not achieve the link between brain activity and behaviors executed by the brain in 2012 project spaun semantic pointer architecture unified network attempted to model multiple parts of the human brain through large scale representations of neural connections that generate complex behaviors in addition to mapping 91 8 93 spaun s design recreates elements of human brain anatomy the model consisting of approximately 2 5 160 million 160 neurons includes features of the visual and motor cortices gabaergic and dopaminergic connections the ventral tegmental area vta substantia nigra and others the design allows for several functions in response to eight tasks using visual inputs of typed or handwritten characters and outputs carried out by a mechanical arm spaun s functions include copying a drawing recognizing images and counting 91 8 93 there are good reasons to believe that regardless of implementation strategy the predictions of realising artificial brains in the near future are optimistic 91 citation needed 93 in particular brains including the human brain and cognition are not currently well understood and the scale of computation required is unknown another near term limitation is that all current approaches for brain simulation require orders of magnitude larger power consumption compared with a human brain the human brain consumes about 20 160 w of power whereas current supercomputers may use as much as 1 160 mw i e an order of 100 000 more 91 citation needed 93 artificial brain thought experiment edit some critics of brain simulation 91 9 93 believe that it is simpler to create general intelligent action directly without imitating nature some commentators 91 10 93 have used the analogy that early attempts to construct flying machines modeled them after birds but that modern aircraft do not look like birds see also edit ai takeover animat artificial consciousness artificial intelligence
