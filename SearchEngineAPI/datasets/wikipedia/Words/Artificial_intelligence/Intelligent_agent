intelligent agent from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search software agent which acts autonomously for the term in intelligent design see intelligent designer in artificial intelligence an intelligent agent ia is anything which perceives its environment takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals and may improve its performance with learning or may use knowledge they may be simple or complex a thermostat is considered an example of an intelligent agent as is a human being as is any system that meets the definition such as a firm a state or a biome 91 1 93 simple reflex agent diagram leading ai textbooks define artificial intelligence as the study and design of intelligent agents a definition that considers goal directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence goal directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics rational agent 91 1 93 an agent has an objective function that encapsulates all the ia s goals such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will upon completion maximize the expected value of the objective function 91 2 93 for example a reinforcement learning agent has a reward function that allows the programmers to shape the ia s desired behavior 91 3 93 and an evolutionary algorithm s behavior is shaped by a fitness function 91 4 93 intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science ethics the philosophy of practical reason as well as in many interdisciplinary socio cognitive modeling and computer social simulations intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents aia to distinguish them from their real world implementations an autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users contents 1 definition of

definitions and uses 8 see also 9 notes 10 inline references 11 other references 12 external links definition of artificial intelligence edit computer science defines ai research as the study of intelligent agents 91 a 93 the leading ai textbook 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 2 93 defines an agent as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators defines a rational agent as an agent that acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge and defines the field of artificial intelligence research as the study and design of rational agents a similar definition of ai is given by kaplan and haenlein a system s ability to correctly interpret external data to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation 91 7 93 padgham amp winikoff 2005 agree that an intelligent agent is situated in an environment and responds in a timely though not necessarily real time manner to environment changes however intelligent agents must also proactively pursue goals in a flexible and robust way 91 b 93 optional desiderata include that the agent be rational and that the agent be capable of belief desire intention analysis 91 8 93 advantages of this definition edit philosophically it avoids several lines of criticism unlike the turing test it does not refer to human intelligence in any way thus there is no need to discuss if it is real vs simulated intelligence i e synthetic vs artificial intelligence and does not indicate that such a machine has a mind consciousness or true understanding i e it does not imply john searle s strong ai hypothesis it also doesn t attempt to draw a sharp dividing line between behaviors that are intelligent and behaviors that are unintelligent programs need only be measured in terms of their objective function more importantly it has a number of practical advantages that have helped move ai research forward it provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given goal function it also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields such as mathematical optimization which is defined in terms of goals or economics which uses the same definition of a rational agent 91 9 93 objective function edit further information utility function economics 32 and loss function mathematics an agent that is assigned an explicit goal function is considered more intelligent if it consistently takes actions that successfully maximize its programmed goal function the goal can be simple 1 if the ia wins a game of go 0 otherwise or complex perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past the goal function encapsulates all of the goals the agent is driven to act on in the case of rational agents the function also encapsulates the acceptable trade offs between accomplishing conflicting goals terminology varies for example some agents seek to maximize or minimize a utility function objective function or loss function 91 6 93 91 2 93 goals can be explicitly defined or induced if the ai is programmed for reinforcement learning it has a reward function that encourages some types of behavior and punishes others alternatively an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a fitness function to mutate and preferentially replicate high scoring ai systems similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food 91 10 93 some ai systems such as nearest neighbor instead of reason by analogy these systems are not generally given goals except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data 91 11 93 such systems can still be benchmarked if the non goal system is framed as a system whose goal is to accomplish its narrow classification task 91 12 93 systems that are not traditionally considered agents such as knowledge representation systems are sometimes subsumed into the paradigm by framing them as agents that have a goal of for example answering questions as accurately as possible the concept of an action is here extended to encompass the act of giving an answer to a question as an additional extension mimicry driven systems can be framed as agents who are optimizing a goal function based on how closely the ia succeeds in mimicking the desired behavior 91 6 93 91 2 93 in the generative adversarial networks of the 2010s an encoder generator component attempts to mimic and improvise human text composition the generator is attempting to maximize a function encapsulating how well it can fool an antagonistic predictor discriminator component 91 13 93 while gofai systems often accept an explicit goal function the paradigm can also be applied to neural networks and to evolutionary computing reinforcement learning can generate intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a reward function 91 14 93 sometimes rather than setting the reward function to be directly equal to the desired benchmark evaluation function machine learning programmers will use reward shaping to initially give the machine rewards for incremental progress in learning 91 15 93 yann lecun stated in 2018 that most of the learning algorithms that people have come up with essentially consist of minimizing some objective function 91 16 93 alphazero chess had a simple objective function each win counted as 1 point and each loss counted as 1 point an objective function for a self driving car would have to be more complicated 91 17 93 evolutionary computing can evolve intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a fitness function that influences how many descendants each agent is allowed to leave 91 4 93 the theoretical and uncomputable aixi design is a maximally intelligent agent in this paradigm 91 18 93 however in the real world the ia is constrained by finite time and hardware resources and scientists compete to produce algorithms that can achieve progressively higher scores on benchmark tests with real world hardware 91 19 93 91 relevant 93 classes of intelligent agents edit russel and norvig s classification edit russell amp norvig 2003 group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability 91 20 93 simple reflex agents edit simple reflex agent simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept ignoring the rest of the percept history the agent function is based on the condition action rule if condition then action this agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments if the agent can randomize its actions it may be possible to escape from infinite loops model based reflex agents edit model based reflex agent a model based agent can handle partially observable environments its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure that describes the part of the world which cannot be seen this knowledge about how the world works is called a model of the world hence the name model based agent a model based reflex agent should maintain some sort of internal model that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using the internal model it then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent an agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment 91 21 93 goal based agents edit model based goal based agent goal based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model based agents by using goal information goal information describes situations that are desirable this provides the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities selecting the one which reaches a goal state search and planning are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent s goals utility based agents edit model based utility based agent goal based agents only distinguish between goal states and non goal states it is also possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is this measure can be obtained through the use of a utility function which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state a more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to how well they satisfied the agent s goals the term utility can be used to describe how happy the agent is a rational utility based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes that is what the agent expects to derive on average given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome a utility based agent has to model and keep track of its environment tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception representation reasoning and learning learning agents edit a general learning agent learning has the advantage that it allows the agents to initially operate in unknown environments and to become more competent than its initial knowledge alone might allow the most important distinction is between the learning element which is responsible for making improvements and the performance element which is responsible for selecting external actions the learning element uses feedback from the critic on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element or actor should be modified to do better in the future the performance element is what we have previously considered to be the entire agent it takes in percepts and decides on actions the last component of the learning agent is the problem generator it is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences weiss s classification edit weiss 2013 defines four classes of agents logic based agents in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction reactive agents in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action belief desire intention agents in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs desires and intentions of the agent and finally layered architectures in which decision making is realized via various software layers each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction other edit in 2013 alexander wissner gross published a theory pertaining to freedom and intelligence for intelligent agents 91 22 93 91 23 93 hierarchies of agents edit main article multi agent system to actively perform their functions intelligent agents today are normally gathered in a hierarchical structure containing many sub agents intelligent sub agents process and perform lower level functions taken together the intelligent agent and sub agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence generally an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators and so that it operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator however a hierarchy of controller layers is often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex high level goals 91 24 93 agent function edit a simple agent program can be defined mathematically as a function f called the agent function 91 25 93 which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient feedback element function or constant that affects eventual actions f p x2217 x2192 a displaystyle f p ast rightarrow a agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of utility of individual options deduction over logic rules fuzzy logic etc 91 26 93 the program agent instead maps every possible percept to an action 91 27 93 we use the term percept to refer to the agent s perceptional inputs at any given instant in the following figures an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators applications edit this section may contain material unrelated or

system to provide specific expertise to the user 91 citation needed 93 they can also be used to optimize coordination of human groups online 91 28 93 hallerbach et al discussed the application of agent based approaches for the development and validation of automated driving systems via a digital twin of the vehicle under test and microscopic traffic simulation based on independent agents 91 29 93 waymo has created a multi agent simulation environment carcraft to test algorithms for self driving cars 91 30 93 91 31 93 it simulates traffic interactions between human drivers pedestrians and automated vehicles people s behavior is imitated by artificial agents based on data of real human behavior the basic idea of using agent based modeling to understand self driving cars was discussed as early as 2003 91 32 93 alternative definitions and uses edit intelligent agent is also often used as a vague marketing term sometimes synonymous with virtual personal assistant 91 33 93 some 20th century definitions characterize an agent as a program that aids a user or that acts on behalf of a user 91 34 93 these examples are known as software agents and sometimes an intelligent software agent that is a software agent with intelligence is referred to as an intelligent agent according to nikola kasabov ia systems should exhibit the following characteristics 91 35 93 accommodate new problem solving rules incrementally adapt online and in real time are able to analyze themselves in terms of behavior error and success learn and improve through interaction with the environment
