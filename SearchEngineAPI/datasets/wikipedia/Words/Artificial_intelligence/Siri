appointments but was criticized for requiring stiff user commands and having a lack of flexibility it was also criticized for lacking information on certain nearby places and for its inability to understand certain english accents in 2016 and 2017 a number of media reports said that siri lacked innovation particularly against new competing voice assistants the reports concerned siri s limited set of features bad voice recognition and undeveloped service integrations as causing trouble for apple in the field of artificial intelligence and cloud based services the basis for the complaints reportedly due to stifled development as caused by apple s prioritization of user privacy and executive power struggles within the company 91 3 93 its launch was also overshadowed by the death of

the elements sigr victory and fr r beautiful 91 6 93 siri s speech recognition engine was provided by nuance communications a speech technology company 91 7 93 neither apple nor nuance acknowledged this for years 91 8 93 91 9 93 until nuance ceo paul ricci confirmed it at a 2011 technology conference 91 7 93 the speech recognition system uses sophisticated machine learning techniques including convolutional neural networks and long short term memory 91 10 93 the initial siri prototype was implemented using the active platform a joint project between the artificial intelligence center of sri international and the vrai group at ecole polytechnique f d rale de lausanne the active platform was the focus of a ph d thesis led by didier guzzoni who joined siri as its chief scientist 91 11 93

from the verge in september 2013 about voice actors their work and machine learning developments hinted that allison dufty was the voice behind siri 91 17 93 91 18 93 but this was disproven when dufty

american audio forensics expert 91 16 93 apple has never acknowledged it 91 16 93 the original british male voice was provided by jon briggs a former technology journalist and for 12 years narrated for the hit bbc quiz show the weakest link 91 15 93 after discovering he was siri s voice by watching television he first spoke about the role in november 2011 he acknowledged that the voice work was done five or six years ago and that he didn t know how the recordings would be used 91 19 93 91 20 93 the original australian voice was provided by karen jacobsen a voice over artist known in australia as the gps girl 91 15 93 91 21 93 in an interview between all three voice actors and the guardian briggs said that the original system was recorded for a us company called scansoft who were then bought by nuance apple simply licensed it 91 21 93 for ios 11 apple auditioned hundreds of candidates to find new female voices then recorded several hours of speech including different personalities and expressions to build a new text to speech voice based on deep learning technology 91 22 93 in february 2022 apple added quinn its first gender neutral voice as a fifth user option to the ios 15 4 developer release 91 23 93 integration edit siri released as a stand alone application for the ios operating system in february 2010 and at the time the developers were also intending to release siri for android and blackberry devices 91 24 93 two months later apple acquired siri 91 25 93 91 26 93 91 27 93 on october 4 2011 apple introduced the iphone 4s with a beta version of siri 91 28 93 91 29 93 after the announcement apple removed the existing standalone siri app from app store 91 30 93 techcrunch wrote that though the siri app supports iphone 4 its removal from app store might also have had a financial aspect for the company in providing an incentive for customers to upgrade devices 91 30 93 third party developer steven troughton smith however managed to port siri to iphone 4 though without being able to communicate with apple s servers 91 31 93 a few days later troughton smith working with an anonymous person nicknamed chpwn managed to fully hack siri enabling its full functionalities on iphone 4 and ipod touch devices 91 32 93 additionally developers were also able to successfully create and distribute legal ports of siri to any device capable of running ios 5 though a proxy server was required for apple server interaction 91 33 93 siri remote for the apple tv over the years apple has expanded the line of officially supported products including newer

weather like today and how many dollars are in a euro find basic facts including how many people live in france and how tall is mount everest siri usually uses wikipedia to answer 91 43 93 schedule events and reminders including schedule a meeting and remind me to 160 handle device settings such as take a picture turn off wi fi and increase the brightness search the internet including define 160 find pictures of 160 and search twitter for 160 navigation including take me home what s traffic like on the way home and find driving directions to 160 translate words and phrases from english to a

siri also offers numerous pre programmed responses to amusing questions 91 44 93 such questions include what is the meaning of life to which siri may reply all evidence to date suggests it s chocolate why am i here to which it may reply i don t know frankly i ve wondered that myself and will you marry me to which it may respond with my end user licensing agreement does not cover marriage my apologies 91 45 93 91 46 93 initially limited to female voices apple announced in june 2013 that siri would feature a gender option adding a male voice counterpart 91 47 93 in september 2014 apple added the ability for users to speak hey siri to enable the assistant without the requirement of physically handling the device 91 48 93 in september 2015 the hey siri feature was updated to include individualized voice recognition a presumed effort to prevent non owner activation 91 49 93 91 50 93 with the announcement of ios 10 in june 2016 apple opened up limited third party developer access to siri through a dedicated application programming interface api the api restricts usage of siri to engaging with third party messaging apps payment apps ride sharing apps and internet calling apps 91 51 93 91 52 93 in ios 11 siri is able to handle follow up questions supports language translation and opens up to more third party actions including task management 91 53 93 91 54 93 additionally users are able to type to siri 91 55 93 and a new privacy minded on device learning technique improves siri s suggestions by privately analyzing personal usage of different ios applications 91 56 93 reception edit siri received mixed reviews during its beta release as an integrated part of iphone 4s in october 2011 mg siegler of techcrunch wrote that siri was great praising the potential for siri after losing the beta tag the amount of times siri hasn t been able to understand and execute my request is astonishingly low 160 just imagine what will happen when apple partners with other services to expand siri further and imagine when they have an api that any developer can use this really could alter the mobile landscape 91 57 93 writing for the new york times david pogue also praised siri s language understanding and ability to understand context siri thinks for a few seconds displays a beautifully formatted response and speaks in a calm female voice 160 it s mind blowing how inexact your utterances can be siri understands everything from what s the weather going to be like in tucson this weekend to will i need an umbrella tonight 160 once i tried saying make an appointment with patrick for thursday at 3 siri responded note that you already have an all day appointment about boston trip for this thursday shall i schedule this anyway unbelievable 91 58 93 jacqui cheng of ars technica wrote that apple s claims of what siri could do were bold and the early demos even bolder though siri shows real potential these kinds of high expectations are bound to be disappointed 160 apple makes clear that the product is still in beta an appropriate label in our opinion 91 59 93 while praising its ability to decipher our casual language and deliver very specific and accurate result sometimes even providing additional information cheng noted and criticized its restrictions particularly when the language moved away from stiffer commands into more human interactions one example included the phrase send a text to jason clint sam and lee saying we re having dinner at silver cloud which siri interpreted as sending a message to jason only containing the text clint sam and lee saying we re having dinner at silver cloud she also noted a lack of proper editability as saying edit message to say we re at silver cloud and you should come find us generated clint sam and lee saying we re having dinner at silver cloud to say we re at silver cloud and you should come find us 91 59 93 google s executive chairman and former chief eric schmidt conceded that siri could pose a competitive threat to the company s core search business 91 60 93 siri was criticized by pro abortion rights organizations including the american civil liberties union aclu and naral pro choice america after users found that siri could not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers nearby sometimes directing users to crisis pregnancy centers instead 91 61 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 natalie kerris a spokeswoman for apple told the new york times our customers want to use siri to find out all types of information and while it can find a lot it doesn t always find what you want 160 these are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone it simply means that as we bring siri from beta to a final product we find places where we can do better and we will in the coming weeks 91 64 93 in january 2016 fast company reported that in then recent months siri had begun to confuse the word abortion with adoption citing health experts who stated that the situation had gotten worse however at the time of fast company 39 s report the situation had changed slightly with siri offering a more comprehensive list of planned parenthood facilities although adoption clinics continue to pop up but near the bottom of the list 91 65 93 91 66 93 siri has also not been well received by some english speakers with distinctive accents including scottish 91 67 93 and americans from boston or the south 91 68 93 in march 2012 frank m fazio filed a class action lawsuit against apple on behalf of the people who bought iphone 4s and felt misled about the capabilities of siri alleging its failing to function as depicted in apple s siri commercials fazio filed the lawsuit in california and claimed that the iphone 4s was merely a more expensive iphone 4 if siri fails to function as advertised 91 69 93 91 70 93 on july 22 2013 u s district judge claudia wilken in san francisco dismissed the suit but said the plaintiffs could amend at a later time the reason given for dismissal was that plaintiffs did not sufficiently document enough misrepresentations by apple for the trial to proceed 91 71 93 perceived lack of innovation edit in june 2016 the verge 39 s sean o kane wrote about the then upcoming major ios 10 updates with a headline stating siri s big upgrades won t matter if it can t understand its users what apple didn t talk about was solving siri s biggest most basic flaws it s still not very good at voice recognition and when it gets it right the results are often clunky and these problems look even worse when you consider that apple now has full fledged competitors in this space amazon s alexa microsoft s cortana and google s assistant 91 72 93 also writing for the verge walt mossberg had previously questioned apple s efforts in cloud based services writing 91 73 93 160 perhaps the biggest disappointment among apple s cloud based services is the one it needs most today right now siri before apple bought it siri was on the road to being a robust digital assistant that could do many things and integrate with many services even though it was being built by a startup with limited funds and people after apple bought siri the giant company seemed to treat it as a backwater restricting it to doing only a few slowly increasing number of tasks like telling you the weather sports scores movie and restaurant listings and controlling the device s functions its unhappy founders have left apple to build a new ai service called viv and on too many occasions siri either gets things wrong doesn t know the answer or can t verbalize it instead it shows you a web search result even when you re not in a position to read it in october 2016 bloomberg reported that apple had plans to unify the teams behind its various cloud based services including a single campus and reorganized cloud computing resources aimed at improving the processing of siri s queries 91 74 93 although another report from the verge in june 2017 once again called siri s voice recognition bad 91 75 93 in june 2017 the wall street journal published an extensive report on the lack of innovation with siri following competitors advancement in the field of voice assistants noting that apple workers anxiety levels went up a notch on the announcement of amazon s alexa the journal wrote today apple is playing catch up in a product category it invented increasing worries about whether the technology giant has lost some of its innovation edge the report gave the primary causes being apple s prioritization of user privacy including randomly tagged six month siri searches whereas google and amazon keep data until actively discarded by the user 91 clarification needed 93 and executive power struggles within apple apple did not comment on the report while eddy cue said apple often uses generic data rather than user data to train its systems and has the ability to improve siri s performance for individual users with information kept on their iphones 91 3 93 91 76 93 privacy controversy edit in july 2019 a then anonymous whistleblower and former apple contractor thomas le bonniec said that siri regularly records some of its users conversations even when it was not activated the recordings are sent to apple contractors grading siri s responses on a variety of factors among other things the contractors regularly hear private conversations between doctors and patients business and drug deals and couples having sex apple did not disclose this in its privacy documentation and did not provide a way for its users to opt in or out 91 77 93 in august 2019 apple apologized halted the siri grading program and said that it plans to resume later this fall when software updates are released to its users 91 78 93 ios 13 2 released in october 2019 introduced the ability to opt out of the grading program and to delete all the voice recordings that apple has stored on its servers 91 79 93 in may 2020 thomas le bonniec revealed himself as the whistleblower and sent a letter to european data protection regulators calling on them to investigate apple s past and present use of siri recordings he argued that even though apple has apologized it has never faced the consequences for its years long grading program 91 80 93 91 81 93 swearing edit the ios version of siri ships with a vulgar content filter however it is disabled by default and must be enabled by the user manually 91 82 93 therefore if siri can be triggered into cursing broadcasting discriminatory content and so on the actions will most likely be carried out over its history multiple methods and techniques have been used to trigger siri into swearing the language filter is not perfect and can still be bypassed 91 citation needed 93 in 2018 ars technica reported a new glitch that could be exploited by a user requesting the definition of mother be read out loud siri would issue a response and ask the user if they would like to hear the next definition when the user replies with yes siri would mention mother as being short for motherf ker 91 83 93 this resulted in multiple youtube videos featuring the responses and or how to trigger them apple fixed the issue silently although it is unconfirmed if the videos specifically brought it to their attention the content is picked up from third party sources such as the oxford english dictionary and not a supplied message from the corporation 91 84 93 it is unknown whether this glitch was exploited with the vulgar content filter enabled in popular culture edit siri provided the voice of puter in the
