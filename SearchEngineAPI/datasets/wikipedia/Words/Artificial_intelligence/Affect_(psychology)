from the german gef hl meaning feeling 91 3 93 a number of experiments have been conducted in the study of social and psychological affective preferences i e what people like or dislike specific research has been done on preferences attitudes impression formation and decision making this research contrasts findings with recognition memory old new judgments allowing researchers to demonstrate reliable distinctions between the two affect based judgments and cognitive processes have been examined with noted differences indicated and some argue affect and cognition are under the control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other in a variety of ways zajonc 1980 both affect and cognition may constitute independent sources of effects within systems of information processing others suggest emotion is a result of an anticipated experienced or imagined outcome of an adaptational transaction between organism and environment therefore cognitive appraisal processes are keys to the development and expression of an emotion lazarus 1982 dimensions of affect edit affective states vary along three principal dimensions valence arousal and motivational intensity 91 4 93 valence is the subjective spectrum of positive to negative evaluation of an experience an individual may have had emotional valence refers to the emotion s consequences emotion eliciting circumstances or subjective feelings or attitudes 91 5 93 arousal is objectively measurable as activation of the sympathetic nervous system but can also be assessed subjectively via self report motivational intensity refers to the impulsion to act 91 6 93 the strength of an urge to move toward or away from a stimulus and whether or not to interact with said stimulus simply moving is not considered approach or avoidance motivation 91 7 93 it is important to note that arousal is different from motivational intensity while arousal is a construct that is closely related to motivational intensity they differ in that motivation necessarily implies action while arousal does not 91 8 93 affect display edit affect is sometimes used to mean affect display which is a facial vocal or gestural behavior that serves as an indicator of affect apa 2006 91 9 93 affects edit in psychology affect brings about an organism s interaction with stimuli affect can influence cognitive scope the breadth of cognitive processes 91 10 93 initially it was thought that positive affects broadened whereas negative affects narrowed cognitive scope 91 4 93 however evidence now suggests that affects high in motivational intensity narrow cognitive scope whereas affects low in motivational intensity broaden it the construct of cognitive scope could be valuable in cognitive psychology 91 4 93 affect tolerance edit according to a research article about affect tolerance written by psychiatrist jerome sashin affect tolerance can be defined as the ability to respond to a stimulus which would ordinarily be expected to evoke affects by the subjective experiencing of feelings 91 11 93 essentially it refers to one s ability to react to emotions and feelings one who is low in affect tolerance would show little to no reaction to emotion and feeling of any kind this is closely related to alexithymia alexithymia is a subclinical phenomenon involving a lack of emotional awareness or more specifically difficulty in identifying and describing feelings and in distinguishing feelings from the bodily sensations of emotional arousal 91 12 93 at its core alexithymia is an inability for an individual to recognize what emotions they are feeling as well as an inability to describe them according to dalya samur and colleagues 91 13 93 people with alexithymia have been shown to have correlations with increased suicide rates 91 14 93 mental discomfort 91 15 93 and deaths 91 16 93 affect tolerance 91 17 93 91 18 93 factors including anxiety sensitivity intolerance of uncertainty and emotional distress tolerance may be helped by mindfulness 91 19 93 mindfulness refers to the practice of being hyper aware of one s own feelings thoughts sensations and the stimulus of the environment around you not in an anxiety inducing way but in a gentle and pleasant way mindfulness has been shown to produce increased subjective well being reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity and improved behavioral regulation 91 20 93 relationship to behavior and cognition edit the affective domain represents one of the three divisions described in modern psychology the other two being the behavioral and the cognitive classically these divisions have also been referred to as the abc s of psychology 91 21 93 however in certain views the cognitive may be considered as a part of the affective or the affective as a part of the cognitive 91 22 93 it is important to note that cognitive and affective states are merely analytic categories 91 23 93 instinctive and cognitive factors in causation of affect edit affect can mean an instinctual reaction to stimulation that occurs before the typical cognitive processes considered necessary for the formation of a more complex emotion robert b zajonc asserts this reaction to stimuli is primary for human beings and that it is the dominant reaction for non human organisms zajonc suggests that affective reactions can occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding and be made sooner and with greater confidence than cognitive judgments zajonc 1980 many theorists e g lazarus 1982 consider affect to be post cognitive elicited only after a certain amount of cognitive processing of information has been accomplished in this view such affective reactions as liking disliking evaluation or the experience of pleasure or displeasure each result from a different prior cognitive process that makes a variety of content discriminations and identifies features examines them to find value and weighs them according to their contributions brewin 1989 some scholars e g lerner and keltner 2000 argue that affect can be both pre and post cognitive initial emotional responses produce thoughts which produce affect in a further iteration some scholars argue that affect is necessary for enabling more rational modes of cognition e g damasio 1994 a divergence from a narrow reinforcement model of emotion allows other perspectives about how affect influences emotional development thus temperament cognitive development socialization patterns and the idiosyncrasies of one s family or subculture might interact in nonlinear ways for example the temperament of a highly reactive low self soothing infant may disproportionately affect the process of emotion regulation in the early months of life griffiths 1997 some other social sciences such as geography or anthropology have adopted the concept of affect during the last decade in french psychoanalysis a major contribution to the field of affect comes from andr green 91 24 93 the focus on affect has largely derived from the work of deleuze and brought emotional and visceral concerns into such conventional discourses as those on geopolitics urban life and material culture affect has also challenged methodologies of the social sciences by emphasizing somatic power over the idea of a removed objectivity and therefore has strong ties with the contemporary non representational theory 91 25 93 psychometric measurement edit main article affect measures affect has been found across cultures to comprise both positive and negative dimensions the most commonly used measure in scholarly research is the positive and negative affect schedule panas 91 26 93 the panas is a lexical measure developed in a north american setting and consisting of 20 single word items for instance excited alert determined for positive affect and upset guilty and jittery for negative affect however some of the panas items have been found either to be redundant or to have ambiguous meanings to english speakers from non north american cultures as a result an internationally reliable short form the i panas sf has been developed and validated comprising two 5 item scales with internal reliability cross sample and cross cultural factorial invariance temporal stability convergent and criterion related validities 91 27 93 mroczek and kolarz have also developed another set of scales to measure positive and negative affect 91 28 93 each of the scales has 6 items the scales have shown evidence of acceptable validity and reliability across cultures 91 28 93 91 29 93 91 30 93 non conscious affect and perception edit main articles unconscious mind and perception in relation to perception a type of non conscious affect may be separate from the cognitive processing of environmental stimuli a monohierarchy of perception affect and cognition considers the roles of arousal attention tendencies affective primacy zajonc 1980 evolutionary constraints shepard 1984 1994 and covert perception weiskrantz 1997 within the sensing and processing of preferences and discriminations emotions are complex chains of events triggered by certain stimuli there is no way to completely describe an emotion by knowing only some of its components verbal reports of feelings are often inaccurate because people may not know exactly what they feel or they may feel several different emotions at the same time there are also situations that arise in which individuals attempt to hide their feelings and there are some who believe that public and private events seldom coincide exactly and that words for feelings are generally more ambiguous than are words for objects or events therefore non conscious emotions need to be measured by measures circumventing self report such as the implicit positive and negative affect test ipanat quirin kaz n amp kuhl 2009 affective responses on the other hand are more basic and may be less problematic in terms of assessment brewin has proposed two experiential processes that frame non cognitive relations between various affective experiences those that are prewired dispositions i e non conscious processes able to select from the total stimulus array those stimuli that are causally relevant using such criteria as perceptual salience spatiotemporal cues and predictive value in relation to data stored in memory brewin 1989 p 160 381 and those that are automatic i e subconscious processes characterized as rapid relatively inflexible and difficult to modify requiring minimal attention to occur and capable of being activated without intention or awareness 1989 p 160 381 but a note should be considered on the differences between affect and emotion arousal edit main article arousal arousal is a basic physiological response to the presentation of stimuli when this occurs a non conscious affective process takes the form of two control mechanisms one mobilizing and the other immobilizing within the human brain the amygdala regulates an instinctual reaction initiating this arousal process either freezing the individual or accelerating mobilization the arousal response is illustrated in studies focused on reward systems that control food seeking behavior balleine 2005 researchers have focused on learning processes and modulatory processes that are present while encoding and retrieving goal values when an organism seeks food the anticipation of reward based on environmental events becomes another influence on food seeking that is separate from the reward of food itself therefore earning the reward and anticipating the reward are separate processes and both create an excitatory influence of reward related cues both processes are dissociated at the level of the amygdala and are functionally integrated within larger neural systems motivational intensity and cognitive scope edit measuring cognitive scope edit cognitive scope can be measured by tasks involving attention perception categorization and memory some studies use a flanker attention task to figure out whether cognitive scope is broadened or narrowed for example using the letters h and n participants need to identify as quickly as possible the middle letter of 5 when all the letters are the same e g hhhhh and when the middle letter is different from the flanking letters e g hhnhh 91 31 93 broadened cognitive scope would be indicated if reaction times differed greatly from when all the letters were the same compared to when the middle letter is different 91 31 93 other studies use a navon attention task to measure difference in cognitive scope a large letter is composed of smaller letters in most cases smaller l s or f s that make up the shape of the letter t or h or vice versa 91 32 93 broadened cognitive scope would be suggested by a faster reaction to name the larger letter whereas narrowed cognitive scope would be suggested by a faster reaction to name the smaller letters within the larger letter 91 32 93 a source monitoring paradigm can also be used to measure how much contextual information is perceived for instance participants are tasked to watch a screen which serially displays words to be memorized for 3 seconds each and also have to remember whether the word appeared on the left or the right half of the screen 91 33 93 the words were also encased in a colored box but the participants did not know that they would eventually be asked what color box the word appeared in 91 33 93 main research findings edit motivation intensity refers to the strength of urge to move toward or away from a particular stimulus 91 4 93 anger and fear affective states induced via film clips conferred more selective attention on a flanker task compared to controls as indicated by reaction times that were not very different even when the flanking letters were different from the middle target letter 91 4 93 91 31 93 both anger and fear have high motivational intensity because propulsion to act would be high in the face of an angry or fearful stimulus like a screaming person or coiled snake affects high in motivational intensity thus narrow cognitive scope making people able to focus more on target information 91 4 93 91 31 93 after seeing a sad picture participants were faster to identify the larger letter in a navon attention task suggesting more global or broadened cognitive scope 91 4 93 91 32 93 the sad emotion is thought to sometimes have low motivational intensity but after seeing a disgusting picture participants were faster to identify the component letters indicative of a localized more narrow cognitive scope 91 4 93 91 32 93 disgust has high motivational intensity affects high in motivational intensity thus narrow cognitive scope making people able to focus more on central information 91 4 93 91 31 93 91 32 93 whereas affects low in motivational intensity broadened cognitive scope allowing for faster global interpretation 91 32 93 the changes in cognitive scope associated with different affective states is evolutionarily adaptive because high motivational intensity affects elicited by stimuli that require movement and action should be focused on in a phenomenon known as goal directed behavior 91 34 93 for example in early times seeing a lion fearful stimulus probably elicited a negative but high motivational affective state fear in which the human being was propelled to run away in this case the goal would be to avoid getting killed moving beyond just negative affective states researchers wanted to test whether or not the negative or positive affective states varied between high and low motivational intensity to evaluate this theory harmon jones gable and price created an experiment using appetitive picture priming and the navon task which would allow them to measure the attentional scope with the detection of the navon letters the navon task included a neutral affect comparison condition typically neutral states cause broadened attention with a neutral stimulus 91 35 93 they predicted that a broad attentional scope could cause a faster detection of global large letters whereas a narrow attentional scope could cause a faster detection of local small letters the evidence proved that the appetitive stimuli produced a narrowed attentional scope the experimenters further increased the narrowed attentional scope in appetitive stimuli by telling participants they would be allowed to consume the desserts shown in the pictures the results revealed that their hypothesis was correct in that the broad attentional scope led to quicker detection of global letters and the narrowed attentional scope led to quicker detection of local letters researchers bradley codispoti cuthbert and lang wanted to further examine the emotional reactions in picture priming instead of using an appetitive stimulus they used stimulus sets from the international affective picture system iaps the image set includes various unpleasant pictures such as snakes insects attack scenes accidents illness and loss they predicted that the unpleasant picture would stimulate a defensive motivational intensity response which would produce strong emotional arousal such as skin gland responses and cardiac deceleration 91 36 93 participants rated the pictures based on valence arousal and dominance on the self assessment manikin sam rating scale the findings were consistent with the hypothesis and proved that emotion is organized motivationally by the intensity of activation in appetitive or defensive systems 91 36 93 prior to research in 2013 harmon jones and gable performed an experiment to examine whether neural activation related with approach motivation intensity left frontal central activity would trigger the effect of appetitive stimuli on narrowed attention they also tested whether individual dissimilarities in approach motivation are associated with attentional narrowing in order to test the hypothesis the researchers used the same navon task with appetitive and neutral pictures in addition to having the participants indicate how long since they had last eaten in minutes to examine the neural activation the researchers used an electroencephalography and recorded eye movements in order to detect what regions of the brain were being used during approach motivation the results supported the hypothesis suggesting that the left frontal central hemisphere is relative for approach motivational processes and narrowed attentional scope 91 35 93 some psychologists were concerned that the individuals who were hungry had an increase in the left frontal central due to frustration this statement was proved false because the research shows that the dessert pictures increase positive affect even in the hungry individuals 91 35 93 the findings revealed that narrowed cognitive scope has the ability to assist us in goal accomplishment clinical applications edit later on researchers connected motivational intensity to clinical applications and found that alcohol related pictures caused narrowed attention for persons who had a strong motivation to consume alcohol the researchers tested the participants by exposing them to alcohol and neutral pictures after the picture was displayed on a screen the participants finished a test evaluating attentional focus the findings proved that exposure to alcohol related pictures led to a narrowing of attentional focus to individuals who were motivated to use alcohol 91 37 93 however exposure to neutral pictures did not correlate with alcohol related motivation to manipulate attentional focus the alcohol myopia theory amt states that alcohol consumption reduces the amount of information available in memory which also narrows attention so only the most proximal items or striking sources are encompassed in attentional scope 91 37 93 this narrowed attention leads intoxicated persons to make more extreme decisions than they would when sober researchers provided evidence that substance related stimuli capture the attention of individuals when they have high and intense motivation to consume the substance motivational intensity and cue induced narrowing of attention has a unique role in shaping people s initial decision to consume alcohol 91 37 93 in 2013 psychologists from the university of missouri investigated the connection between sport achievement orientation and alcohol outcomes they asked varsity athletes to complete a sport orientation questionnaire which measured their sport related achievement orientation on three scales competitiveness win orientation and goal orientation the participants also completed assessments of alcohol use and alcohol related problems the results revealed that the goal orientation of the athletes were significantly associated with alcohol use but not alcohol related problems 91 38 93 in terms of psychopathological implications and applications college students showing depressive symptoms were better at retrieving seemingly nonrelevant contextual information from a source monitoring paradigm task 91 33 93 namely the students with depressive symptoms were better at identifying the color of the box the word was in compared to nondepressed students 91 33 93 sadness low motivational intensity is usually 91 39 93 associated with depression so the more broad focus on contextual information of sadder students supports that affects high in motivational intensity narrow cognitive scope whereas affects low in motivational intensity broaden cognitive scope 91 4 93 91 33 93 the motivational intensity theory states that the difficulty of a task combined with the importance of success determine the energy invested by an individual 91 40 93 the theory has three main layers the innermost layer says human behavior is guided by the desire to conserve as much energy as possible individuals aim to avoid wasting energy so they invest only the energy that is required to complete the task the middle layer focuses on the difficulty of tasks combined with the importance of success and how this affects energy conservation it focuses on energy investment in situations of clear and unclear task difficulty the last layer looks at predictions for energy invested by a person when they have several possible options to choose at different task difficulties 91 40 93 the person is free to choose among several possible options of task difficulty the motivational intensity theory offers a logical and consistent framework for research researchers can predict a person s actions by assuming effort refers to the energy investment the motivational intensity theory is used to show how changes in goal attractiveness and energy investment correlate mood edit main article mood psychology mood like emotion is an affective state however an emotion tends to have a clear focus i e its cause is self evident while mood tends to be more unfocused and diffuse 91 41 93 mood according to batson shaw and oleson 1992 involves tone and intensity and a structured set of beliefs about general expectations of a future experience of pleasure or pain or of positive or negative affect in the future unlike instant reactions that produce affect or emotion and that change with expectations of future pleasure or pain moods being diffuse and unfocused and thus harder to cope with can last for days weeks months or even years schucman 1975 moods are hypothetical constructs depicting an individual s emotional state researchers typically infer the existence of moods from a variety of behavioral referents blechman 1990 habitual negative affect and negative mood is characteristic of high neuroticism 91 42 93 positive affect and negative affect panas represent independent domains of emotion in the general population and positive affect is strongly linked to social interaction positive and negative daily events show independent relationships to subjective well being and positive affect is strongly linked to social activity recent research suggests that high functional support is related to higher levels of positive affect in his work on negative affect arousal and white noise seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins 91 43 93 the exact process through which social support is linked to positive affect remains unclear the process could derive from predictable regularized social interaction from leisure activities where the focus is on relaxation and positive mood or from the enjoyment of shared activities the techniques used to shift a negative mood to a positive one are called mood repair strategies social interaction edit affect display is a critical facet of interpersonal communication evolutionary psychologists have advanced the hypothesis that hominids have evolved with sophisticated capability of reading affect displays 91 44 93 emotions are portrayed as dynamic processes that mediate the individual s relation to a continually changing social environment 91 45 93 in other words emotions are considered to be processes of establishing maintaining or disrupting the relation between the organism and the environment on matters of significance to the person 91 46 93 most social and psychological phenomena occur as the result of repeated interactions between multiple individuals over time these interactions should be seen as a multi agent system a system that contains multiple agents interacting with each other and or with their environments over time the outcomes of individual agents behaviors are interdependent each agent s ability to achieve its goals depends on not only what it does but also what other agents do 91 47 93 emotions are one of the main sources for the interaction emotions of an individual influence the emotions thoughts and behaviors of others others reactions can then influence their future interactions with the individual expressing the original emotion as well as that individual s future emotions and behaviors emotion operates in cycles that can involve multiple people in a process of reciprocal influence 91 48 93 affect emotion or feeling is displayed to others through facial expressions hand gestures posture voice characteristics and other physical manifestation these affect displays vary between and within cultures and are displayed in various forms ranging from the most discrete of facial expressions to the most dramatic and prolific gestures 91 49 93 observers are sensitive to agents emotions and are capable of recognizing the messages these emotions convey they react to and draw inferences from an agent s emotions the emotion an agent displays may not be an authentic reflection of his or her actual state see also emotional labor agents emotions can have effects on four broad sets of factors emotions of other persons inferences of other persons behaviors of other persons interactions and relationships between the agent and other persons emotion may affect not only the person at whom it was directed but also third parties who observe an agent s emotion moreover emotions can affect larger social entities such as a group or a team emotions are a kind of message and therefore can influence the emotions attributions and ensuing behaviors of others potentially evoking a feedback process to the original agent agents feelings evoke feelings in others by two suggested distinct mechanisms emotion contagion people tend to automatically and unconsciously mimic non verbal expressions 91 50 93 mimicking occurs also in interactions involving textual exchanges alone 91 51 93 emotion interpretation an individual may perceive an agent as feeling a particular emotion and react with complementary or situationally appropriate emotions of their own the feelings of the others diverge from and in some way complement the feelings of the original agent people may not only react emotionally but may also draw inferences about emotive agents such as the social status or power of an emotive agent his competence and his credibility 91 52 93 for example an agent presumed to be angry may also be presumed to have high power 91 53 93 see also edit psychology portal affect consciousness affect control
