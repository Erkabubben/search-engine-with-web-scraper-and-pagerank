science memory preservation privacy quantum information science vte in computer science and information science an ontology encompasses a representation formal naming and definition of the categories properties and relations between the concepts data and entities that substantiate one many or all domains of discourse more simply an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories research and applications new ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages 91 1 93 for instance the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in marxist economics 91 2 93 but also in other subfields of economics 91 3 93 an example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much see risk management what ontologies in both computer science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities ideas and events with all their interdependent properties and relations according to a system of categories in both fields there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering e g quine and kripke in philosophy sowa and guarino in computer science 91 4 93 and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible e g foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy bfo and cyc in artificial intelligence applied ontology is considered a successor to prior work in philosophy however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects e g perdurantism and endurantism may be ontologically more primary than processes artificial intelligence has retained the most attention regarding applied ontology in subfields like natural language processing within machine translation and knowledge representation but ontology editors are being used often in a range of fields like education without the intent to contribute to ai 91 5 93 contents 1 etymology 2 history 3 components 4

ontos i e being that which is which is the present participle of the verb eim i e to be i am and logia i e logical discourse see classical compounds for this type of word formation 91 6 93 91 7 93 while the etymology is greek the oldest extant record of the word itself the new latin form ontologia appeared in 1606 in the work ogdoas scholastica by jacob lorhard lorhardus and in 1613 in the lexicon philosophicum by rudolf g ckel goclenius the first occurrence in english of ontology as recorded by the oed oxford english dictionary online edition 2008 came in archeologia philosophica nova or new principles of philosophy by gideon harvey history edit further information metaphysics 160 history further information artificial intelligence 160 history ontologies arise out of the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics which deals with questions like what exists and what is the nature of reality one of five traditional branches of philosophy metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals intrinsic and extrinsic properties or essence and existence metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history since the mid 1970s researchers in the field of artificial intelligence ai have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful ai systems 91 citation needed 93 ai researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning which was only marginally successful in the 1980s the ai community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge based systems in particular david powers introduced the word ontology to ai to refer to real world or robotic grounding 91 8 93 91 9 93 91 10 93 publishing in 1990 literature reviews emphasizing grounded ontology in association with the call for papers for a aaai summer symposium machine learning of natural language and ontology with an expanded version published in sigart bulletin and included as a preface to the proceedings 91 11 93 some researchers drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy 91 12 93 in 1993 the widely cited web page and paper toward principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing by tom gruber 91 13 93 used ontology as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies gruber introduced the term as a specification of a conceptualization an ontology is a description like a formal specification of a program of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents this definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions but more general and it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy 91 14 93 attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance gruber stated 1993 ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes class definitions and the subsumption relation but ontologies need not be limited to these forms ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions 160 8212 that is definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world 91 15 93 to specify a conceptualization one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms 91 16 93 as refinement of gruber s definition feilmayr and w 2016 stated an ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity 91 17 93 components edit main article ontology components contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities regardless of the language in which they are expressed most ontologies describe individuals instances classes concepts attributes and relations in this section each of these components is discussed in turn common components of ontologies include individuals instances or objects the basic or ground level objects classes sets collections concepts classes in programming types of objects or kinds of things attributes aspects properties features characteristics or parameters that objects and classes can have relations ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another function terms complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement restrictions formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input rules statements in the form of an if then antecedent consequent sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form axioms assertions including rules in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application this definition differs from that of axioms in generative grammar and formal logic in those disciplines axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge as used here axioms also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements events the changing of attributes or relations ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages types edit domain ontology edit a domain ontology or domain specific ontology represents concepts which belong to a realm of the world such as biology or politics each domain ontology typically models domain specific definitions of terms for example the word card has many different meanings an ontology about the domain of poker would model the playing card meaning of the word while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the punched card and video card meanings since domain ontologies are written by different people they represent concepts in very specific and unique ways and are often incompatible within the same project as systems that rely on domain ontologies expand they often need to merge domain ontologies by hand tuning each entity or using a combination of software merging and hand tuning this presents a challenge to the ontology designer different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages different intended usage of the ontologies and different perceptions of the domain based on cultural background education ideology etc 91 citation needed 93 at present merging ontologies that are not developed from a common upper ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time consuming and expensive domain ontologies that use the same upper ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology entities can be merged with less effort there are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies 91 18 93 but this area of research is still ongoing and it s a recent event to see the issue sidestepped by having multiple domain ontologies using the same upper ontology like the obo foundry upper ontology edit main article upper ontology an upper ontology or foundation ontology is a model of the commonly shared relations and objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies it usually employs a core glossary that overarches the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain ontologies standardized upper ontologies available for use include bfo boro method dublin core gfo cyc sumo umbel the unified foundational ontology ufo 91 19 93 and dolce 91 20 93 91 21 93 wordnet has been considered an upper ontology by some and has been used as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies 91 22 93 hybrid ontology edit the gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology visualization edit a survey of ontology visualization methods is presented by katifori et al 91 23 93 an updated survey of ontology visualization

ontology building is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain 91 27 93 it is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process the ontology life cycle the methods and methodologies for building ontologies and the tools and languages that support them 91 28 93 91 29 93 ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications and organizational procedures for a particular domain ontology engineering offers a direction for overcoming semantic obstacles such as those related to the definitions of business terms and software classes known challenges with ontology engineering include ensuring the ontology is current with domain knowledge and term use providing sufficient specificity and concept coverage for the domain of interest thus minimizing the content completeness problem ensuring the ontology can support its use cases editors edit ontology editors are applications designed to assist in the creation or manipulation of ontologies it is common for ontology editors to use one or more ontology languages aspects of ontology editors include visual navigation possibilities within the knowledge model inference engines and information extraction support for modules the import and export of foreign knowledge representation languages for ontology matching and the support of meta ontologies such as owl s dublin core etc 91 30 93 learning edit main article ontology learning ontology learning is the automatic or semi automatic creation of ontologies including extracting a domain s terms from natural language text as building ontologies manually is extremely labor intensive and time consuming there is great motivation to automate the process information extraction and text mining have been explored to automatically link ontologies to documents for example in the context of the biocreative challenges 91 31 93 research edit further information epistemology epistemological assumptions which in research asks what do you know or how do you know it creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic or area for potential research as epistemology is directly linked to knowledge and how we come about accepting certain truths individuals conducting academic research must understand what allows them to begin theory building simply epistemological assumptions force researchers to question how they arrive at the knowledge they have 91 citation needed 93 languages edit main article ontology language an ontology language is a formal language used to encode an ontology there are a number of such languages for ontologies both proprietary and standards based common algebraic specification language is a

preparedness for public health incidences and reasoning engines which is a semantics based health information system capable of tracking and evaluating situations and occurrences that may affect public health geographic information systems bring together data from different sources and benefit therefore from ontological metadata which helps to connect the semantics of the data 91 81 93 domain specific ontologies are extremely important in biomedical research which requires named entity disambiguation of various biomedical terms and abbreviations that have the same string of characters but represent different biomedical concepts for example csf can represent colony stimulating factor or cerebral spinal fluid both of which are represented by the same term csf in biomedical literature 91 82 93 this is why a large number of public ontologies are related to the life sciences life science data science tools that fail to implement these types of biomedical ontologies will not be able to
