university press oup is the university press of the university of oxford it is the largest university press in the world and its printing history dates back to the 1480s having been officially granted the legal right to print books by decree in 1586 91 2 93 it is the second oldest university press after cambridge university press 91 3 93 91 4 93 91 5 93 it is a department of the university of oxford and is governed by a group of 15 academics known as the delegates of the press who are appointed by the vice chancellor of the university of oxford the delegates of the press are led by the secretary to the delegates who serves as oup s chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies oxford university press has had a similar governance structure since the 17th century 91 6 93 the press is located on walton street oxford opposite somerville college in the inner suburb of jericho for the last 500 years oup has primarily focused on the publication of pedagogical texts and continues this tradition today by publishing academic journals dictionaries english language resources bibliographies books on indology music classics literature history as well as bibles and atlases oup has offices throughout the world primarily in locations that were once part of the british empire mainly india and the united states contents 1 history 2 museum 2 1 clarendon

fell part of his collection now known as the fell types shown in the oup museum the university of oxford began printing around 1480 and grew into a major printer of bibles prayer books and scholarly works 91 7 93 oxford s chancellor archbishop william laud consolidated the legal status of the university s printing in the 1630s and petitioned charles i for rights that would enable oxford to compete with the stationers company and the king s printer he obtained a succession of royal grants and oxford s great charter in 1636 gave the university the right to print all manner of books 91 8 93 laud also obtained the privilege from the crown of printing the king james or authorized version of scripture at oxford 91 9 93 this privilege created substantial returns in the next 250 years 91 10 93 following the english civil war vice chancellor john fell dean of christ church bishop of oxford and secretary to the delegates was determined to installed printing presses in 1668 making it the university s first central print shop 91 11 93 in 1674 oup began to print a broadsheet calendar known as the oxford almanack that has been produced annually without interruption from fell s time to the present day 91 12 93 fell drew up the first formal programme for the university s printing which envisaged hundreds of works including the bible in greek editions of the coptic gospels and works of the church fathers texts in arabic and syriac comprehensive editions of classical philosophy poetry and mathematics a wide range of medieval scholarship and also a history of insects more perfect than any yet extant 91 13 93 oxford university press building from walton street generally speaking the early 18th century marked a lull in the press s expansion it suffered from the absence of any figure comparable to fell the business was rescued by the intervention of a single delegate william blackstone disgusted by the chaotic state of the press and antagonized by the vice chancellor george huddesford blackstone called for sweeping reforms that would firmly set out the delegates powers and obligations officially record their deliberations and accounting and put the print shop on an efficient footing 91 14 93 nonetheless randolph ignored this document and it was not until blackstone threatened legal action that changes began the university had moved to adopt all of blackstone s reforms by 1760 91 15 93 by the late 18th century the press had become more focused in 1825 the delegates bought land in walton street buildings were constructed from plans drawn up by daniel robertson and edward blore and the press moved into them in 1830 91 16 93 this site remains the main office of oup in the 21st century at the corner of walton street and great clarendon street northwest of oxford city centre the press now entered an era of enormous change in 1830 it was still a joint stock printing business in an academic backwater offering learned works to a relatively small readership of scholars and clerics 91 17 93 at this time thomas combe joined the press and became the university s printer until his death in 1872 combe was a better business man than most delegates but still no innovator he failed to grasp the huge commercial potential of india paper which grew into one of oxford s most profitable trade secrets in later years 91 18 93 even so combe earned a fortune through his shares in the business and the acquisition and renovation of the bankrupt paper mill at wolvercote combe showed little interest however in producing fine printed work at the press 91 19 93 the most well known text associated with his print shop was the flawed first edition of alice s adventures in wonderland printed by oxford at the expense of its author lewis carroll charles lutwidge dodgson in 1865 91 20 93 it took the 1850 royal commission on the workings of the university and a new secretary bartholomew price to shake up the press 91 21 93 appointed in 1868 price had already recommended to the university that the press needed an efficient executive officer to exercise vigilant superintendence of the business including its dealings with alexander macmillan who became the publisher for oxford s printing in 1863 and in 1866 helped price to create the clarendon press series of cheap elementary school books 160 perhaps the first time that oxford used the clarendon imprint 91 22 93 under price the press began to take on its modern shape major new lines of work began to give one example in 1875 the delegates approved the series sacred books of the east under the editorship of friedrich max m ller bringing a vast range of religious thought to a wider readership 91 23 93 equally price moved oup towards publishing in its own right the press had ended its relationship with parker s in 1863 and in 1870 bought a small london bindery for some bible work 91 24 93 macmillan s contract ended in 1880 and wasn t renewed by this time oxford also had a london warehouse for bible stock in paternoster row and in 1880 its manager henry frowde 1841 1927 was given the formal title of publisher to the university frowde came from the book trade not the university and remained an enigma to many one obituary in oxford s staff magazine the clarendonian admitted very few of us here in oxford had any personal knowledge of him 91 25 93 despite that frowde became vital to oup s growth adding new lines of books to the business presiding over the massive publication of the revised version of the new testament in 1881 91 26 93 and playing a key role in setting up the press s first office outside britain in new york city in 1896 91 27 93 price transformed oup in 1884 the year he retired as secretary the delegates bought back the last shares in the business 91 28 93 the press was now owned wholly by the university with its own paper mill print shop bindery and warehouse its output had increased to include school books and modern scholarly texts such as james clerk maxwell s a treatise on electricity amp magnetism 1873 which proved fundamental to einstein s thought 91 29 93 simply put without abandoning its traditions or quality of work price began to turn oup into an alert modern publisher in 1879 he also took on the publication that led that process to its conclusion the huge project that became the oxford english dictionary oed 91 30 93 offered to oxford by james murray and the philological society the new english dictionary was a grand academic and patriotic undertaking lengthy negotiations led to a formal contract murray was to edit a work estimated to take 10 years and to cost approximately 9 000 91 31 93 both figures were wildly optimistic the dictionary began to appear in print in 1884 but the first edition was not completed until 1928 13 years after murray s death at a cost of around 375 000 91 32 93 this vast financial burden and its implications landed on price s successors 91 citation needed 93 the next secretary philip lyttelton gell was appointed by the vice chancellor benjamin jowett in 1884 but struggled and was finally dismissed in 1897 91 33 93 the assistant secretary charles cannan took over with little fuss and even less affection for his predecessor gell was always here but i cannot make out what he did 91 34 93 charles cannan who had been instrumental in gell s removal succeeded gell in 1898 by the early 20th century oup expanded its overseas trade the 1920s saw skyrocketing prices of both materials and labour paper especially was hard to come by and had to be imported from south america through trading companies economies and markets slowly recovered as the 1920s progressed in 1928 the press s imprint read london edinburgh glasgow leipzig toronto melbourne cape town bombay calcutta madras and shanghai not all of these were full fledged branches in leipzig there was a depot run by h bohun beet and in canada and australia there were small functional depots in the cities and an army of educational representatives penetrating the rural fastnesses to sell the press s stock as well as books published by firms whose agencies were held by the press very often including fiction and light reading in india the branch depots in bombay madras and calcutta were imposing establishments with sizable stock inventories for the presidencies themselves were large markets and the educational representatives there dealt mostly with upcountry trade the depression of 1929 dried profits from the americas to a trickle and india became the one bright spot in an otherwise dismal picture bombay was the nodal point for distribution to the africas and onward sale to australasia and people who trained at the three major depots moved later on to pioneer branches in africa and south east asia 91 35 93 in 1923 oup established a music department 91 36 93 at the time such musical publishing enterprises however were rare 91 37 93 and few of the delegates or former publishers were themselves musical or had extensive music backgrounds 91 citation needed 93 oup bought an anglo french music company and all its facilities connections and resources 91 38 93 this concentration provided oup two mutually reinforcing benefits a niche in music publishing unoccupied by potential competitors and a branch of music performance and composition that the english themselves had largely neglected hinnells proposes that the early music department s mixture of scholarship and cultural nationalism in an area of music with largely unknown commercial prospects was driven by its sense of cultural philanthropy given the press s academic background and a desire to promote national music outside the german mainstream 91 39 93 it was not until 1939 that the music department showed its first profitable year 91 40 93 the period following world war ii saw consolidation in the face of the breakup of the empire and the post war reorganization of the commonwealth in the 1960s oup southern africa started publishing local authors for the general reader but also for schools and universities under its three crowns books imprint its territory includes botswana lesotho swaziland and namibia as well as south africa the biggest market of the five 91 citation needed 93 oup southern africa is now one of the three biggest educational publishers in south africa and focuses its attention on publishing textbooks dictionaries atlases and supplementary material for schools and textbooks for universities its author base is overwhelmingly local and in 2008 it entered into a partnership with the university to support scholarships for south africans studying postgraduate degrees 91 citation needed 93 today the north american branch in new york city is primarily a distribution branch to facilitate the sale of oxford bibles in the united states it also handles marketing of all books of its parent macmillan by the end of 2021 oup usa has published eighteen pulitzer prize winning books 91 41 93 operations in south asia and east and south east asia were and in the case of the former remain major parts of the company in july 2020 during the covid 19 pandemic its bookshop on the high street closed on 27 august 2021 oup closed oxuniprint its printing division the closure will mark the final chapter of oup s centuries long history of printing 91 42 93 museum edit the oxford university press museum is located on great clarendon street oxford visits must be booked in advance and are led by a member of the archive staff displays include a 19th century printing press the oup buildings and the printing and history of the oxford almanack alice in wonderland and the oxford english dictionary 91 citation needed 93 clarendon press edit oup came to be known as the clarendon press when printing moved from the sheldonian theatre to the clarendon building in broad street in 1713 the name continued to be used when oup moved to its present site in oxford in 1830 the label clarendon press took on a new meaning when oup began publishing books through its london office in the early 20th century to distinguish the two offices london books were labelled oxford university press publications while those from oxford were labelled clarendon press books this labeling ceased in the 1970s when the london office of oup closed today oup reserves clarendon press as an imprint for oxford publications of particular academic importance 91 43 93 scholarly journals edit oup as oxford journals has also been a major publisher of academic journals both in the sciences and the humanities as of 2022 91 update 93 it publishes more than 500 journals on behalf of learned societies around the world 91 44 93 it has been noted as one of the first university presses to publish an open access journal nucleic acids research and probably the first to introduce hybrid open access journals offering optional open access to authors to allow all readers online access to their paper without charge 91 45 93 the oxford open model applies to the majority of their journals 91 46 93 the oup is a member of the open access scholarly publishers

2001 oxford university press has financially supported the clarendon bursary a university of oxford graduate scholarship scheme 91 49 93 controversies edit tehran book fair controversy edit in february 1989 iran s ayatollah khomeini issued a fatwa urging the execution of british author salman rushdie and of all involved in the publication of his novel the satanic verses rushdie went into hiding and there began an international movement to boycott book trading with iran there was therefore outrage when in april 1989 oup broke the world wide embargo and chose to attend the tehran book fair oup justified this with the statement that we deliberated about it quite deeply but felt it certainly wasn t in our interests or iran s as a whole to stay away 91 50 93 the new york times 91 51 93 international herald tribune and the sunday times 91 52 93 all condemned oxford s decision malcolm vs oxford university 1986 1992 edit in 1990 in the uk court of appeal author andrew malcolm won a landmark legal judgment against oxford university press for its breach of a contract to publish his philosophical text making names reporting on the verdict in the observer laurence marks wrote it is the first time in living memory that grub street has won such a victory over its oppressors 91 53 93 the case ended in july 1992 with a tomlin order a damages settlement under the terms of which the servants and agents of oxford university are permanently barred from denigrating malcolm or making names rendering it the first book in literary history to be afforded such legal protection 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 closure of poetry list edit in november 1998 the oup announced the closure on commercial grounds of its modern poetry list andrew potter oup s director of music trade paperbacks and bibles told the times that the list just about breaks even the university expects us to operate on commercial grounds especially in this day and age 91 57 93 in the same article the poet d j enright who had been with oup since 1979 said there was no warning it was presented as a fait accompli even the poetry editor didn t know the money involved is peanuts it s a good list built up over many years 91 57 93 in february 1999 arts minister alan howarth made a speech in oxford in which he denounced the closure oup is not merely a business it is a department of the university of oxford and has charitable status it is part of a great university which the government supports financially and which exists to develop and transmit our intellectual culture it is a perennial complaint by the english faculty that the barbarians are at the gate indeed they always are but we don t expect the gatekeepers themselves the custodians to be barbarians 91 58 93 oxford s professor valentine cunningham in the thes wrote increasingly oup has behaved largely like a commercial outfit with pound signs in its eyes and a readiness to dumb down for the sake of popularity and sales sacking poets not because they lose money but because they do not make enough of it it is an allegory of a university press missing the point mistaking its prime purpose 91 59 93 a decade later oup s managing director ivon asquith reflected on the public relations damage caused by the episode if i had foreseen the self inflicted wound we would suffer i would not have let the proposal get as far as the finance committee 91 60 93 tax exemption controversy edit since the 1940s both oup and its sister press the cup had made applications to the inland revenue for exemption from corporate tax the first application by cup in 1940 was refused on the ground that since the press was printing and publishing for the outside world and not simply for the internal use of the university the press s trade went beyond the purpose and objects of the university and in terms of the act was not exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the university 91 61 93 similar applications by oup in 1944 and 1950 were also rejected by the inland revenue whose officers repeatedly pointed out that the university presses were in open competition with commercial tax liable publishers in november 1975 cup s chief executive geoffrey cass again applied to the inland revenue and a year later cup s tax exemption was quietly conceded 91 62 93 91 63 93 oup s chief executive george richardson followed suit in 1977 and oup s tax exemption was granted in 1978 the decisions were not made public the issue was only brought to public attention as a result of press interest in oup following the poetry list closure controversy 91 59 93 in 1999 the campaigner andrew malcolm published his second book the remedy in which he alleged that oup is in breach of its 1978 tax exemption conditions this was reported in a front page article in the oxford times along with oup s response 91 64 93 in march 2001 after a 28 year battle with the indian tax authorities oup lost its tax exemption in india the supreme court ruled that oup was not tax exempt in the subcontinent because it does not carry out any university activities there but acts simply as a commercial publisher 91 65 93 in order to pay off back taxes owed since the 1970s oup was obliged to sell its mumbai headquarters building oxford house the bookseller reported that the case has again raised questions about oup s status in the uk 91 66 93 in 2003 joel rickett of the bookseller wrote an article in the guardian describing the resentment of commercial rivals at oup s tax exemption rickett accurately predicted that the funds which would have been paid in tax were likely to be used to confirm oup s dominance by buying up other publishers 91 67 93 between 1989 and 2018 oup bought out over 70 rival book and journal publishers in 2007 with the new public benefit requirement of the revised charities act the issue was re examined 91 68 93 with particular reference to the oup 91 69 93 in 2008 cup s and oup s privilege was attacked by rival publishers 91 70 93 91 71 93 in 2009 the guardian invited andrew malcolm to write an article on the subject 91 72 93 east african bribery scandal edit in july 2012 the uk s serious fraud office found oup s branches in kenya and tanzania guilty of bribery to obtain school bookselling contracts sponsored by the world bank oxford was fined 1 9 million in recognition of sums it received which were generated through unlawful conduct and barred from applying for world bank financed projects for three years 91 73 93 see also edit category oxford university press
