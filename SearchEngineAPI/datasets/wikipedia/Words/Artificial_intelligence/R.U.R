rossum had invented a substance like organic matter though with a different chemical composition he argued with his nephew about their motivations for creating artificial life while the elder wanted to create animals to prove or disprove the existence of god his nephew only wanted to become rich young rossum finally locked away his uncle in a lab to play with the monstrosities he had created and created thousands of robots by the time the play takes place circa the year 2000 91 11 93 robots are cheap and available all over the world they have become essential for industry after meeting the heads of r u r helena reveals that she is a representative of the league of humanity an organization that wishes to liberate the robots the managers of the factory find this absurd they see robots as

deaths are a direct result of their choices busman is killed while attempting to negotiate a peace with the robots the robots storm the factory and kill all the humans except for alquist the company s chief engineer the robots spare him because they recognize that he works with his hands like the robots 91 12 93 epilogue edit years have passed alquist who still lives attempts to recreate the formula that helena destroyed he is a mechanical engineer though with insufficient knowledge of biochemistry so he has made little progress the robot government has searched for surviving humans to help alquist and found none alive officials from the robot government beg him to complete the formula even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other robots for it alquist yields he will kill and dissect robots thus completing the circle of violence begun in act two alquist is disgusted robot primus and helena develop human feelings and fall in love playing a hunch alquist threatens to dissect primus and then helena each begs him to take him or herself and spare the other alquist now realizes that primus and helena are the new adam and eve and gives charge of the world to them apek s conception of robots edit u s wpa federal theatre project poster for the production by the marionette theatre new york 1939 the robots described in apek s play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton they are not mechanical devices but rather artificial biological organisms that may be mistaken for humans a comic scene at the beginning of the play shows helena arguing with her future husband harry domin because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess domin sulla let miss glory have a look at you helena stands and offers her hand pleased to meet you it must be very hard for you out here cut off from the rest of the world sulla i do not know the rest of the world miss glory please sit down helena sits where are you from sulla from here the factory helena oh you were born here sulla yes i was made here helena startled what domin laughing sulla isn t a person miss glory she s a robot helena oh please forgive me his robots resemble more modern conceptions of man made life forms such as the replicants in blade runner the hosts in the westworld tv series and the humanoid cylons in the re imagined battlestar galactica but in apek s time there was no conception of modern genetic engineering dna s role in heredity was not confirmed until 1952 there are descriptions of kneading troughs for robot skin great vats for liver and brains and a factory for producing bones nerve fibers arteries and intestines are spun on factory bobbins while the robots themselves are assembled like automobiles 91 13 93 apek s robots are living biological beings but they are still assembled as opposed to grown or born one critic has described apek s robots as epitomizing the traumatic transformation of modern society by the first world war and the fordist assembly line 91 13 93 origin of the word robot edit the play introduced the word robot which displaced older words such as automaton or android in languages around the world in an article in lidov noviny karel apek named his brother josef as the true inventor of the word 91 14 93 91 15 93 in czech robota means forced labour of the kind that serfs had to perform on their masters lands and is derived from rab meaning slave 91 16 93 the name rossum is an allusion to the czech word rozum meaning reason wisdom intellect or common sense 91 10 93 it has been suggested that the allusion might be preserved by translating rossum as reason but only the majer porter version translates the word as reason 91 17 93 production history edit cover of the first edition of the play designed by josef

word it contributed the word robot not only to english but through english to all the languages in which science fiction is now written 91 4 93 in fact asimov s laws of robotics are specifically and explicitly designed to prevent the kind of situation depicted in r u r since asimov s robots are created with a built in total inhibition against harming human beings or disobeying them adaptations
