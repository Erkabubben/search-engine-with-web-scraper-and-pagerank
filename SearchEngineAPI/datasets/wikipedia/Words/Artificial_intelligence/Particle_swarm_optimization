computational science particle swarm optimization pso 91 1 93 is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality it solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions here dubbed particles and moving these particles around in the search space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle s position and velocity each particle s movement is influenced by its local best known position but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search space which are updated as better positions are found by other particles this is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions pso is originally attributed to kennedy eberhart and shi 91 2 93 91 3 93 and was first intended for simulating social behaviour 91 4 93 as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school the algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization the book by kennedy and eberhart 91 5 93 describes many philosophical aspects of pso and swarm intelligence an extensive survey of pso applications is made by poli 91 6 93 91 7 93 recently a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on pso has been published by bonyadi and michalewicz 91 1 93 pso is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions also pso does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized which means pso does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi newton methods however metaheuristics such as pso do not guarantee an optimal solution is

works by having a population called a swarm of candidate solutions called particles these particles are moved around in the search space according to a few simple formulae 91 8 93 the movements of the particles are guided by their own best known position in the search space as well as the entire swarm s best known position when improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm the process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped but not guaranteed that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered formally let f 160 n 160 be the cost function which must be minimized the function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution the gradient of f is not known the goal is to find a solution a for which f a 160 160 f b for all b in the search space which would mean a is the global minimum let s be the number of particles in the swarm each having a position xi 160 n in the search space and a velocity vi 160 n let pi be the best known position of particle i and let g be the best known position of the entire swarm a basic pso algorithm is then 91 9 93 for each particle i 160 160 1 160 160 s do initialize the particle s position with a uniformly distributed random vector xi 160 160 u blo 160 bup initialize the particle s best known position to its initial position pi 160 160 xi if f pi lt f g then update the swarm s best known position g 160 160 pi initialize the particle s

160 xi if f pi lt f g then update the swarm s best known position g 160 160 pi the values blo and bup represent the lower and upper boundaries of the search space respectively the w parameter is the inertia weight the parameters p and g are often called cognitive coefficient and social coefficient the termination criterion can be the number of iterations performed or a solution where the adequate objective function value is found 91 10 93 the parameters w p and g are selected by the practitioner and control the behaviour and efficacy of the pso method below parameter selection edit performance landscape showing how a simple pso variant performs in aggregate on several benchmark problems when varying two pso parameters the choice of pso parameters can have a large impact on optimization performance selecting pso parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 to prevent divergence explosion the inertia weight must be smaller than 1 the two other parameters can be then derived thanks to the constriction approach 91 16 93 or freely selected but the analyses suggest convergence domains to constrain them typical values are in 1 3 displaystyle 1 3 the pso parameters can also be tuned by using another overlaying optimizer a concept known as meta optimization 91 20 93 91 21 93 91 22 93 91 23 93 or even fine tuned during the optimization e g by means of fuzzy logic 91 24 93 91 25 93 parameters have also been tuned for various optimization scenarios 91 26 93 91 27 93 neighbourhoods and topologies edit the topology of the swarm defines the subset of particles with which each particle can exchange information 91 28 93 the basic version of the algorithm uses the global topology as the swarm communication structure 91 10 93 this topology allows all particles to communicate with all the other particles thus the whole swarm share the same best position g from a single particle however this approach might lead the swarm to be trapped into a local minimum 91 29 93 thus different topologies have been used to control the flow of information among particles for instance in local topologies particles only share information with a subset of particles 91 10 93 this subset can be a geometrical one 91 30 93 for example the m nearest particles or more often a social one i e a set of particles that is not depending on any distance in such cases the pso variant is said to be local best vs global best for the basic pso a commonly used swarm topology is the ring in which each particle has just two neighbours but there are many others 91 10 93 the topology is not necessarily static in fact since the topology is related to the diversity of communication of the particles 91 31 93 some efforts have been done to create adaptive topologies spso 91 32 93 apso 91 33 93 stochastic star 91 34 93 tribes 91 35 93 cyber swarm 91 36 93 and c pso 91 37 93 inner workings edit there are several schools of thought as to why and how the pso algorithm can perform optimization a common belief amongst researchers is that the swarm behaviour varies between exploratory behaviour that is searching a broader region of the search space and exploitative behaviour that is a locally oriented search so as to get closer to a possibly local optimum this school of thought has been prevalent since the inception of pso 91 3 93 91 4 93 91 12 93 91 16 93 this school of thought contends that the pso algorithm and its parameters must be chosen so as to properly balance between exploration and exploitation to avoid premature convergence to a local optimum yet still ensure a good rate of convergence to the optimum this belief is the precursor of many pso variants see below another school of thought is that the behaviour of a pso swarm is not well understood in terms of how it affects actual optimization performance especially for higher dimensional search spaces and optimization problems that may be discontinuous noisy and time varying this school of thought merely tries to find pso algorithms and parameters that cause good performance regardless of how the swarm behaviour can be interpreted in relation to e g exploration and exploitation such studies have led to the simplification of the pso algorithm see below convergence edit in relation to pso the word convergence typically refers to two different definitions convergence of the sequence of solutions aka stability analysis converging in which all particles have converged to a point in the search space which may or may not be the optimum convergence to a local optimum where all personal bests p or alternatively the swarm s best known position g approaches a local optimum of the problem regardless of how the swarm behaves convergence of the sequence of solutions has been investigated for pso 91 15 93 91 16 93 91 17 93 these analyses have resulted in guidelines for selecting pso parameters that are believed to cause convergence to a point and prevent divergence of the swarm s particles particles do not move unboundedly and will converge to somewhere however the analyses were criticized by pedersen 91 22 93 for being oversimplified as they assume the swarm has only one particle that it does not use stochastic variables and that the points of attraction that is the particle s best known position p and the swarm s best known position g remain constant throughout the optimization process however it was shown 91 38 93 that these simplifications do not affect the boundaries found by these studies for parameter where the swarm is convergent considerable effort has been made in recent years to weaken the modelling assumption utilized during the stability analysis of pso 91 39 93 with the most recent generalized result applying to numerous pso variants and utilized what was shown to be the minimal necessary modeling assumptions 91 40 93 convergence to a local optimum has been analyzed for pso in 91 41 93 and 91 42 93 it has been proven that pso needs some modification to guarantee finding a local optimum this means that determining convergence capabilities of different pso algorithms and parameters still depends on empirical results one attempt at addressing this issue is the development of an orthogonal learning strategy for an improved use of the information already existing in the relationship between p and g so as to form a leading converging exemplar and to be effective with any pso topology the aims are to improve the performance of pso overall including faster global convergence higher solution quality and stronger robustness 91 43 93 however such studies do not provide theoretical evidence to actually prove their claims adaptive mechanisms edit without the need for a trade off between convergence exploitation and divergence exploration an adaptive mechanism can be introduced adaptive particle swarm optimization apso 91 44 93 features better search efficiency than standard pso apso can perform global search over the entire search space with a higher convergence speed it enables automatic control of the inertia weight acceleration coefficients and other algorithmic parameters at the run time thereby improving the search effectiveness and efficiency at the same time also apso can act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima however apso will introduce new algorithm parameters it does not introduce additional design or implementation complexity nonetheless variants edit numerous variants of even a basic pso algorithm are possible for example there are different ways to initialize the particles and velocities e g start with zero velocities instead how to dampen the velocity only update pi and g after the entire swarm has been updated etc some of these choices and their possible performance impact have been discussed in the literature 91 14 93 a series of standard implementations have been created by leading researchers intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community having a well known strictly defined standard algorithm provides a valuable point of comparison which can be used throughout the field of research to better test new advances 91 10 93 the latest is standard pso 2011 spso 2011 91 45 93 hybridization edit new and more sophisticated pso variants are also continually being introduced in an attempt to improve optimization performance there are certain trends in that research one is to make a hybrid optimization method using pso combined with other optimizers 91 46 93 91 47 93 91 48 93 e g combined pso with biogeography based optimization 91 49 93 and the incorporation of an effective learning method 91 43 93 alleviate premature convergence edit another research trend is to try and alleviate premature convergence that is optimization stagnation e g by reversing or perturbing the movement of the pso particles 91 19 93 91 50 93 91 51 93 91 52 93 another approach to deal with premature convergence is the use of multiple swarms 91 53 93 multi swarm optimization the multi swarm approach can also be used to implement multi objective optimization 91 54 93 finally there are developments in adapting the behavioural parameters of pso during optimization 91 44 93 91 24 93 simplifications edit another school of thought is that pso should be simplified as much as possible without impairing its performance a general concept often referred to as occam s razor simplifying pso was originally suggested by kennedy 91 4 93 and has been studied more extensively 91 18 93 91 21 93 91 22 93 91 55 93 where it appeared that optimization performance was improved and the parameters were easier to tune and they performed more consistently across different optimization problems another argument in favour of simplifying pso is that metaheuristics can only have their efficacy demonstrated empirically by doing computational experiments on a finite number of optimization problems this means a metaheuristic such as pso cannot be proven correct and this increases the risk of making errors in its description and implementation a good example of this 91 56 93 presented a promising variant of a genetic algorithm another popular metaheuristic but it was later found to be defective as it was strongly biased in its optimization search towards similar values for different dimensions in the search space which happened to be the optimum of the benchmark problems considered this bias was because of a programming error and has now been fixed 91 57 93 initialization of velocities may require extra inputs the bare bones pso variant 91 58 93 has been proposed in 2003 by james kennedy and does not need to use velocity at all another simpler variant is the accelerated particle swarm optimization apso 91 59 93 which also does not need to use velocity and can speed up the convergence in many applications a simple demo code of apso is available 91 60 93 multi objective optimization edit pso has also been applied to multi objective problems 91 61 93 91 62 93 91 63 93 in which the objective function comparison takes pareto dominance into account when moving the pso particles and non dominated solutions are stored so as to approximate the pareto front binary discrete and combinatorial edit as the pso equations given above work on real numbers a commonly used method to solve discrete problems is to map the discrete search space to a continuous domain to apply a classical pso and then to demap the result such a mapping can be very simple for example by just using rounded values or more sophisticated 91 64 93 however it can be noted that the equations of movement make use of operators that perform four actions computing the difference of two positions the result is a velocity more precisely a displacement multiplying a velocity by a numerical coefficient adding two velocities applying a velocity to a position usually a position and a velocity are represented by n real numbers and these operators are simply and again but all these mathematical objects can be defined in a completely different way in order to cope with binary problems or more generally discrete ones or even combinatorial ones 91 65 93 91 66 93 91 67 93 91 68 93 one approach is to redefine the operators based on sets 91 69 93 see also edit artificial bee
