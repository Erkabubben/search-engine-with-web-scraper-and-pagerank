lighthill in 1917 and the daughter of an engineer the family lived in paris until 1927 when the father retired and returned to live in england as a young man james lighthill was known as michael lighthill 91 7 93 lighthill was educated at winchester college and graduated with a ba from trinity college cambridge in 1943 91 8 93 he specialised in fluid dynamics and worked at the national physical laboratory at trinity between 1946 and 1959 he was beyer professor of applied mathematics at the university of manchester lighthill then moved from manchester to become director of the royal aircraft establishment at farnborough there he worked on the development of television and communications satellites and on the development of crewed spacecraft this latter work was used in the development of the concorde supersonic airliner in 1955 together with g b whitham lighthill set out the first comprehensive theory of kinematic waves 91 9 93 91 10 93 an application of the method of characteristics with a multitude of applications prime among them fluid flow and traffic flow lighthill s early work included two dimensional aerofoil theory and supersonic flow around solids of revolution in addition to the dynamics of gas at high speeds he studied shock and blast waves and introduced the squirmer model he is credited with founding the subject of aeroacoustics a subject vital to the reduction of noise in jet engines lighthill s eighth power law states that the acoustic power radiated by a jet engine is proportional to the eighth power of the jet speed 91 11 93 he also founded non linear acoustics and showed that the same non linear differential equations could model both flood waves in rivers and traffic flow in highways in 1958 lightill was elected to the american academy of arts and sciences 91 12 93 in 1964 he became the royal society s resident professor at imperial college london before returning to trinity college cambridge five years later as lucasian professor of mathematics a chair he held until 1979 when he was succeeded by stephen hawking lighthill then became provost of university college london ucl 160 a post he held until 1989 lighthill founded the institute of mathematics and its applications ima in 1964 alongside professor sir bryan thwaites in 1968 he was awarded an honorary degree doctor of science by the university of bath 91 13 93 in 1972 he was invited to deliver the macmillan memorial lecture to the institution of engineers and shipbuilders in scotland he chose the subject aquatic animal locomotion 91 14 93 lighthill was elected to the american philosophical society in 1970 91 15 93 in the early 1970s partly in reaction to significant internal discord within that field the science research council src as it was then known asked lighthill to compile a review of academic research in artificial intelligence lighthill s report which was published in 1973 and became known as the lighthill report was highly critical of basic research in foundational areas such as robotics and language processing and formed the basis for the decision by the british government to end support for ai research in all but two universities 91 16 93 starting what is sometimes referred to as the ai winter in 1976 lighthill was elected to the united states national academy of sciences 91 17 93 in 1982 lighthill and alan b tayler were jointly awarded the first ever gold medal of the institute of mathematics and its applications in recognition of their outstanding contributions to mathematics and its applications over a period of years 91 18 93 in 1983 lighthill was awarded the ludwig prandtl ring from the deutsche gesellschaft f r luft und raumfahrt german society for aeronautics and astronautics for outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering his hobby was open water swimming he died in the water in 1998 when the mitral valve in his heart ruptured while he was swimming round the island of sark a feat which he had accomplished many times before 91 19 93 publications edit lighthill m j 1952 on sound generated aerodynamically i general theory proceedings of the royal society a 211 1107
