external links etymology edit the word syntax comes from ancient greek roots coordination which consists of syn together and t xis ordering topics edit the field of syntax contains a number of various topics that a syntactic theory is often designed to handle the relation between the topics is treated differently in different theories and some of them may not be considered to be distinct but instead to be derived from one another i e word order can be seen as the result of movement rules derived from grammatical relations sequencing of subject verb and object edit one basic description of a language s syntax is the sequence in which the subject s verb v and object o usually appear in sentences over 85 of languages usually place the subject first either in the sequence svo or the sequence sov the other possible sequences are vso vos ovs and osv the last three of which are rare in most generative theories of syntax the surface differences arise from a more complex clausal phrase structure and each order may be compatible with multiple derivations however word order can also reflect the semantics or function of the ordered elements 91 4 93 grammatical relations edit another description of a language considers the set of possible grammatical relations in a language or in general and how they behave in relation to one another in the morphosyntactic alignment of the language the description of grammatical relations can also reflect transitivity passivization and head dependent marking or other agreement languages have different criteria for grammatical relations for example subjecthood criteria may have implications for how the subject is referred to from a relative clause or coreferential with an element in an infinite clause 91 5 93 constituency edit constituency is the feature of being a constituent and how words can work together to form a constituent or phrase constituents are often moved as units and the constituent can be the domain of agreement some languages allow discontinuous phrases in which words belonging to the same constituent are not immediately adjacent but are broken up by other constituents constituents may be recursive as they may consist of other constituents potentially of the same type early history edit the a dhy y of p ini from c 4th century bc in ancient india is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory since works on grammar had been written long before modern syntax came about 91 6 93 in the west the school of thought that came to be known as traditional grammar began with the work of dionysius thrax for centuries a framework known as grammaire g n rale first expounded in 1660 by antoine arnauld in a book of the same title dominated work in syntax as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and so there is a single most natural way to express a thought 91 citation needed 93 however in the 19th century with the development of historical comparative linguistics linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic it became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought and so logic could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language 91 citation needed 93 the port royal grammar modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic indeed large parts of port royal logic were copied or adapted from the grammaire g n rale 91 7 93 syntactic categories were identified with logical ones and all sentences were analyzed in terms of subject copula predicate initially that view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as franz bopp the central role of syntax within theoretical linguistics became clear only in the 20th century which could reasonably be called the century of syntactic theory as far as linguistics is concerned for a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries see the monumental work by giorgio graffi 2001 91 8 93 theories edit see also theory of language there are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax one school of thought founded in the works of derek bickerton 91 9 93 sees syntax as a branch of biology since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human mind other linguists e g gerald gazdar take a more platonistic view since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract formal system 91 10 93 yet others e g joseph greenberg consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages syntacticians have attempted to explain the causes of word order variation within individual languages and cross linguistically much of such work has been done within the framework of generative grammar which holds that syntax depends on a genetic endowment common to the human species in that framework and in others linguistic typology and universals have been primary explicanda 91 11 93 alternative explanations such as those by functional linguists have been sought in language processing it is suggested that the brain finds it easier to parse syntactic patterns that are either right or left branching but not mixed the most widely held approach is the performance grammar correspondence hypothesis by john a hawkins who suggests that language is a non innate adaptation to innate cognitive mechanisms cross linguistic tendencies are considered as being based on language users preference for grammars that are organized efficiently and on their avoidance of word orderings that cause processing difficulty some languages however exhibit regular inefficient patterning such as the vo languages chinese with the adpositional phrase before the verb and finnish which has postpositions but there are few other profoundly exceptional languages 91 12 93 more recently it is suggested that the left versus right branching patterns are cross linguistically related only to the place of role marking connectives adpositions and subordinators which links the phenomena with the semantic mapping of sentences 91 13 93 theoretical syntactic models edit dependency grammar edit main article dependency grammar dependency grammar is an approach to sentence structure in which syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation as opposed to the constituency relation of phrase structure grammars dependencies are directed links between words the finite verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on the root some prominent dependency based theories of syntax are the following recursive categorical syntax or algebraic syntax functional generative description meaning text theory operator grammar word grammar lucien tesni re 1893 1954 is widely seen as the father of modern dependency based theories of syntax and grammar he argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate that is associated with the grammars of his day s np vp and remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars in the place of that division he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure 91 14 93 categorial grammar edit main article categorial grammar categorial grammar is an approach in which constituents combine as function and argument according to combinatory possibilities specified in their syntactic categories for example other approaches might posit a rule that combines a noun phrase np and a verb phrase vp but cg would posit a syntactic category np and another np s read as a category that searches to the left indicated by for an np the element on the left and outputs a sentence the element on the right thus the syntactic category for an intransitive verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a function word requiring an np as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output the complex category is notated as np s instead of v the category of transitive verb is defined as an element that requires two nps its subject and its direct object to form a sentence that is notated as np np s which means a category that searches to the right indicated by for an np the object and generates a function equivalent to the vp which is np s which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an np and produces a sentence tree adjoining grammar is a categorial grammar that adds in partial tree structures to the categories stochastic probabilistic grammars network theories edit theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon probability theory are known as stochastic grammars one common implementation of such an approach makes use of a neural network or connectionism functional grammars edit main article functional theories of grammar functionalist models of grammar study the form function interaction by performing a structural and a functional analysis functional discourse grammar dik prague linguistic circle role and reference grammar rrg systemic functional grammar generative syntax edit generative syntax is the study of syntax within the overarching framework of generative grammar generative theories of syntax typically propose analyses of grammatical patterns using formal tools such as phrase structure grammars augmented with additional operations such as syntactic movement their goal in analyzing a particular language is to specify rules which generate all and only the expressions which are well formed in that language in doing so they seek to identify innate domain specific principles of linguistic cognition in line with the wider goals of the generative enterprise generative syntax is among the approaches that adopt the principle of the autonomy of syntax by assuming that meaning and communicative intent is determined by the syntax rather than the other way around generative syntax was proposed in the late 1950s by noam chomsky building on earlier work by zellig harris louis hjelmslev and others since then numerous theories have been proposed under its umbrella transformational grammar tg original theory of generative syntax laid out by chomsky in syntactic structures in 1957 91 15 93 government and binding theory gb revised theory in the tradition of tg developed mainly by chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s 91 16 93 minimalist program mp a reworking of the theory out of the gb framework published by chomsky in 1995 91 17 93 other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are arc pair grammar generalized phrase structure grammar gpsg generative semantics head driven phrase structure grammar hpsg lexical functional grammar lfg nanosyntax relational grammar rg harmonic grammar hg cognitive and usage based grammars edit main article cognitive linguistics the cognitive linguistics framework stems from generative grammar but adheres to evolutionary rather than chomskyan linguistics
