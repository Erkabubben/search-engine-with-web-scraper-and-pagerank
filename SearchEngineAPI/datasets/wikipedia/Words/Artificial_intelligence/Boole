lincoln boole was born in 1815 in lincoln lincolnshire england the son of john boole senior 1779 1848 a shoemaker 91 5 93 and mary ann joyce 91 6 93 he had a primary school education and received lessons from his father but due to a serious decline in business he had little further formal and academic teaching 91 7 93 william brooke a bookseller in lincoln may have helped him with latin which he may also have learned at the school of thomas bainbridge he was self taught in modern languages 91 3 93 in fact when a local newspaper printed his translation of a latin poem a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretence that he was not capable of such achievements 91 8 93 at age 16 boole became the breadwinner for his parents and three younger siblings taking up a junior teaching position in doncaster at heigham s school 91 9 93 he taught briefly in liverpool 91 1 93 greyfriars lincoln which housed the mechanic s institute boole participated in the lincoln mechanics institute in the greyfriars lincoln which was founded in 1833 91 3 93 91 10 93 edward bromhead who knew john boole through the institution helped george boole with mathematics books 91 11 93 and he was given the calculus text of sylvestre fran ois lacroix by the rev george stevens dickson of st swithin s lincoln 91 12 93 without a teacher it took him many years to master calculus 91 1 93 at age 19 boole successfully established his own school in lincoln free school lane 91 13 93 four years later he took over hall s academy in waddington outside lincoln following the death of robert hall in 1840 he moved back to lincoln where he ran a boarding school 91 1 93 boole immediately became involved in the lincoln topographical society serving as a member of the committee and presenting a paper entitled on the origin progress and tendencies of polytheism especially amongst the ancient egyptians and persians and in modern india 91 14 93 boole became a prominent local figure an admirer of john kaye the bishop 91 15 93 he took part in the local campaign for early closing 91 3 93 with edmund larken and others he set up a building society in 1847 91 16 93 he associated also with the chartist thomas cooper whose wife was a relation 91 17 93 plaque from the house in lincoln from 1838 onwards boole was making contacts with sympathetic british academic mathematicians and reading more widely he studied algebra in the form of symbolic methods as far as these were understood at the time and began to publish research papers 91 1 93 professorship and life in cork edit the house at 5 grenville place in cork in which boole lived between 1849 and 1855 and where he wrote the laws of thought picture taken during renovation boole s status as a mathematician was recognised by his appointment in 1849 as the first professor of mathematics at queen s college cork now university college cork ucc in ireland he met his future wife mary everest there in 1850 while she was visiting her uncle john ryall who was professor of greek they married some years later in 1855 91 18 93 91 19 93 he maintained his ties with lincoln working there with e r larken in a campaign to reduce prostitution 91 20 93 honours and awards edit in 1844 boole s paper on a general method in analysis won the first gold prize for mathematics awarded by the royal society 91 21 93 he was awarded the keith medal by the royal society of edinburgh in 1855 91 22 93 and was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1857 91 12 93 he received honorary degrees of ll d from the university of dublin and the university of oxford 91 23 93 boole s gravestone in blackrock cork ireland detail of stained glass window in lincoln cathedral dedicated to boole depicting his favourite bible passage content suggested by his widow god s calling of the prophet samuel 1 samuel 3 1 10 a child dedicated to god by his parents 91 24 93 plaque beneath boole s window in lincoln cathedral works edit boole s first published paper was researches in the theory of analytical transformations with a special application to the reduction of the general equation of the second order printed in the cambridge mathematical journal in february 1840 volume 2 no 8 pp 160 64 73 and it led to a friendship between boole and duncan farquharson gregory the editor of the journal 91 18 93 his works are in about 50 articles and a few separate publications 91 25 93 91 20 93 in 1841 boole published an influential paper in early invariant theory 91 12 93 he received a medal from the royal society for his memoir of 1844 on a general method in analysis 91 18 93 it was a contribution to the theory of linear differential equations moving from the case of constant coefficients on which he had already published to variable coefficients 91 26 93 the innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not commute 91 27 93 in 1847 boole published the mathematical analysis of logic the first of his works on symbolic logic 91 28 93 differential equations edit boole completed two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects during his lifetime the treatise on differential equations 91 29 93 appeared in 1859 and was followed the next year by a treatise on the calculus of finite differences 91 30 93 a sequel to the former work 91 18 93 analysis edit in 1857 boole published the treatise on the comparison of transcendent with certain applications to the theory of definite integrals 91 31 93 in which he studied the sum of residues of a rational function among other results he proved what is now called boole s identity m e s

algebra in 1847 boole published the pamphlet mathematical analysis of logic he later regarded it as a flawed exposition of his logical system and wanted an investigation of the laws of thought on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities to be seen as the mature statement of his views 91 18 93 contrary to widespread belief boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of aristotle s logic rather he intended to systematise it to provide it with a foundation and to extend its range of applicability 91 33 93 boole s initial involvement in logic was prompted by a current debate on quantification between sir william hamilton who supported the theory of quantification of the predicate and boole s supporter augustus de morgan who advanced a version of de morgan duality as it is now called boole s approach was ultimately much further reaching than either sides in the controversy 91 34 93 it founded what was first known as the algebra of logic tradition 91 35 93 among his many innovations is his principle of wholistic reference which was later and probably independently adopted by gottlob frege and by logicians who subscribe to standard first order logic a 2003 article 91 36 93 provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of aristotelian logic and boolean logic it also reveals the centrality of holistic reference in boole s philosophy of logic 1854 definition of the universe of discourse edit in every discourse whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts or of the individual in his intercourse with others there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined the most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application and for them the limits of discourse are co extensive with those of the universe itself but more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field sometimes in discoursing of men we imply without expressing the limitation that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak as of civilised men or of men in the vigour of life or of men under some other condition or relation now whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse furthermore this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse 91 37 93 treatment of addition in logic edit boole conceived of elective symbols of his kind as an algebraic structure but this general concept was not available to him he did not have the segregation standard in abstract algebra of postulated axiomatic properties of operations and deduced properties 91 38 93 his work was a beginning to the algebra of sets again not a concept available to boole as a familiar model his pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties and the treatment of addition was an obvious difficulty in the early days boole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word and and addition by the word or but in boole s original system was a partial operation in the language of set theory it would correspond only to disjoint union of subsets later authors changed the interpretation commonly reading it as exclusive or or in set theory terms symmetric difference this step means that addition is always defined 91 35 93 91 39 93 in fact there is the other possibility that should be read as disjunction 91 38 93 this other possibility extends from the disjoint union case where exclusive or and non exclusive or both give the same answer handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory reflecting the modern use of both boolean rings and boolean algebras which are simply different aspects of one type of structure boole and jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863 in the form of the correct evaluation of x x jevons argued for the result x which is correct for as disjunction boole kept the result as something undefined he argued against the result 0 which is correct for exclusive or because he saw the equation x x 0 as implying x 0 a false analogy with ordinary algebra 91 12 93 probability theory edit the second part of the laws of thought contained a corresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities here the goal was algorithmic from the given probabilities of any system of events to determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with those events 91 40 93 91 18 93 death edit in late november 1864 boole walked in heavy rain from his home at lichfield cottage in ballintemple 91 41 93 to the university a distance of three miles and lectured wearing his wet clothes 91 42 93 he soon became ill developing pneumonia as his wife believed that remedies should resemble their cause she wrapped him in wet blankets the wet having brought on his illness 91 42 93 91 43 93 91 44 93 boole s condition worsened and on 8 december 1864 91 45 93 he died of fever induced pleural effusion he was buried in the church of ireland cemetery of st michael s church road blackrock a suburb of cork there is a commemorative plaque inside the adjoining church 91 46 93 legacy edit bust of boole at university college cork boole is the namesake of the branch of algebra known as boolean algebra as well as the namesake of the lunar crater boole the keyword bool represents a boolean datatype in many programming languages though pascal and java among others both use the full name boolean 91 47 93 the library underground lecture theatre complex and the boole centre for research in informatics 91 48 93 at university college cork are named in his honour a road called boole heights in bracknell berkshire is named after him 19th century development edit boole s work was extended and refined by a number of writers beginning with william stanley jevons who also authored the article about boole in the encyclopaedia britannica augustus de morgan had worked on the logic of relations and charles sanders peirce integrated his work with boole s during the 1870s 91 49 93 other significant figures were platon sergeevich poretskii and william ernest johnson the conception of a boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a propositional calculus is credited to hugh maccoll 1877 in work surveyed 15 years later by johnson 91 49 93 surveys of these developments were published by ernst schr der louis couturat and clarence irving lewis 20th century development edit in modern notation the free boolean algebra on basic propositions p and q arranged in a hasse diagram the boolean combinations make up 16 different propositions and the lines show which are logically related in 1921 the economist john maynard keynes published a book on probability theory a treatise of probability keynes believed that boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis 91 50 93 in his book the last challenge problem david miller provides a general method in accord with boole s system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by keynes and others theodore hailperin showed much earlier that boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems 91 51 93 boole s work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses claude shannon attended a philosophy class at the university of michigan which introduced him to boole s studies shannon recognised that boole s work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant in 1937 shannon went on to write a master s thesis at the massachusetts institute of technology in which he showed how boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical relays then used in telephone routing switches he also proved that circuits with relays could solve boolean algebra problems employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic digital computers victor shestakov at moscow state university 1907 1987 proposed a theory of electric switches based on boolean logic even earlier than claude shannon in 1935 on the testimony of soviet logicians and mathematicians sofya yanovskaya gaaze rapoport roland dobrushin lupanov medvedev and uspensky though they presented their academic theses in the same year 1938 91 clarification needed 93 but the first publication of shestakov s result took place only in 1941 in russian hence boolean algebra became the foundation of practical digital circuit design and boole via shannon and shestakov provided the theoretical grounding for the information age 91 52 93 21st century celebration edit boole s legacy surrounds us everywhere in the computers information storage and retrieval electronic circuits and controls that support life learning and communications in the 21st century his pivotal advances in mathematics logic and probability provided the essential groundwork for modern mathematics microelectronic engineering and computer science university college cork 91 4 93 the year 2015 saw the 200th anniversary of boole s birth to mark the bicentenary year university college cork joined admirers of boole around the world to celebrate his life and legacy ucc s george boole 200 91 53 93 project featured events student outreach activities and academic conferences on boole s legacy in the digital age including a new edition of desmond machale s 1985 biography the life and work of george boole a prelude to the digital age 91

restoration by ucc views edit boole s views were given in four published addresses the genius of sir isaac newton the right use of leisure the claims of science and the social aspect of intellectual culture 91 18 93 the first of these was from 1835 when charles anderson pelham 1st earl of yarborough gave a bust of newton to the mechanics institute in lincoln 91 55 93 the second justified and celebrated in 1847 the outcome of the successful campaign for early closing in lincoln headed by alexander leslie melville of branston hall 91 56 93 the claims of science was given in 1851 at queen s college cork 91 57 93 the social aspect of intellectual culture was also given in cork in 1855 to the cuvierian society 91 58 93 though his biographer des machale describes boole as an agnostic deist 91 59 93 91 60 93 boole read a wide variety of christian theology combining his interests in mathematics and theology he compared the christian trinity of father son and holy ghost with the three dimensions of space and was attracted to the hebrew conception of god as an absolute unity boole considered converting to judaism but in the end was said to have chosen unitarianism reference boole came to speak against what he saw as prideful scepticism and instead favoured the belief in a supreme intelligent cause 91 61 93 he also declared i firmly believe for the accomplishment of a purpose of the divine mind 91 62 93 91 63 93 in addition he stated that he perceived teeming evidences of surrounding design and concluded that the course of this world is not abandoned to chance and inexorable fate 91 64 93 91 65 93 two influences on boole were later claimed by his wife mary everest boole a universal mysticism tempered by jewish thought and indian logic 91 66 93 mary boole stated that an adolescent mystical experience provided for his life s work my husband told me that when he was a lad of seventeen a thought struck him suddenly which became the foundation of all his future discoveries it was a flash of psychological insight into the conditions under which a mind most readily accumulates knowledge for a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of the bible as a whole and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the english church but by the help of a learned jew in lincoln he found out the true nature of the discovery which had dawned on him this was that man s mind works by means of some mechanism which functions normally towards monism 91 67 93 in ch 13 of laws of thought boole used examples of propositions from baruch spinoza and samuel clarke the work contains some remarks on the relationship of logic to religion but they are slight and cryptic 91 68 93 boole was apparently disconcerted at the book s reception just as a mathematical toolset george afterwards learned to his great joy that the same conception of the basis of logic was held by leibniz the contemporary of newton de morgan of course understood the formula in its true sense he was boole s collaborator all along herbert spencer jowett and robert leslie ellis understood i feel sure and a few others but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored 953 the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact 91 67 93 mary boole claimed that there was profound influence via her uncle george everest of indian thought in general and indian logic in particular on george boole as well as on augustus de morgan and charles babbage 91 69 93 think what must have been the effect of the intense hinduizing of three such men as babbage de morgan and george boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830 65 what share had it in generating the vector analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted 91 67 93 boole maintained that no general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise not only the special numerical bases of the science but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning and which whatever they may be as to their essence are at least mathematical as to their form 91 70 93 family edit in 1855 boole married mary everest niece of george everest who later wrote several educational works on her husband s principles the booles had five daughters mary ellen 1856 1908 91 71 93 who married the mathematician and author charles howard

error in his system of probability arises out of his giving two inconsistent definitions of independence 2 he first wins the reader s acquiescence by giving a perfectly correct definition two events are said to be independent when the probability of either of them is unaffected by our expectation of the occurrence or failure of the other 3 but a moment later he interprets the term in quite a different sense for according to boole s second definition we must regard the events as independent unless we are told either that they must concur or that they cannot concur that is to say they are independent unless we know for certain that there is in fact an invariable connection between them the simple events x y z will be said to be conditioned when they are not free to occur in every possible combination in other words when some compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring simple unconditioned events are by definition independent 1 in fact as long as xz is possible x and z are independent this is plainly inconsistent with boole s first definition with which he makes no attempt to reconcile it the consequences of his employing the term independence in a double sense are far reaching for he uses a method of reduction which is only valid when the arguments to which it is applied are independent in the first sense and assumes that it is valid if they are independent in the second sense while his theorems are true if all propositions or events involved are independent in the first sense they are not true as he supposes them to be if the events are independent only in the second sense zetetic gleanings archived from the original on 18 july 2011 retrieved 10 march 2009 that dissertation has since been hailed as one of the most significant master
