outline of object recognition from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from object recognition jump to navigation jump to search topical guide to object recognition this article is about object recognition in computer vision for object recognition in neuroscience see cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition object recognition 8211 technology in the field of computer vision for finding and identifying objects in an image or video sequence humans recognize a multitude of objects in images with little effort despite the fact that the image of the objects may vary somewhat in different view points in many different sizes and scales or even when they are translated or rotated objects can even be recognized when they are partially obstructed from view this task is still a challenge for computer vision systems many approaches to the task have been implemented over multiple decades contents 1 approaches based on cad like object models 1 1 recognition by parts 2

models edit edge detection primal sketch marr mohan and nevatia 91 1 93 lowe olivier faugeras recognition by parts edit generalized cylinders thomas binford geons irving biederman dickinson forsyth and ponce appearance based methods edit use example images called templates or exemplars of the objects to perform recognition objects look different under varying conditions changes in lighting or color changes in viewing direction changes in size shape a single exemplar is unlikely to succeed reliably however it is impossible to represent all appearances of an object edge matching edit uses edge detection techniques such as the canny edge detection to find edges changes in lighting and color usually don t have much effect on image edges strategy detect edges in template and image compare edges images to find the template must consider range of possible template positions measurements good count the number of overlapping edges not robust to changes in shape better count the number of template edge pixels with some distance of an edge in the search image best determine probability distribution of distance to nearest edge in search image if template at correct position estimate likelihood of each template position generating image divide and conquer search edit strategy consider all positions as a set a cell in the space of positions determine lower bound on score at best position in cell if bound is too large prune cell if bound is not too large divide cell into subcells and try each subcell recursively process stops when cell is small enough unlike multi resolution search this technique is guaranteed to find all matches that meet the criterion assuming that the lower bound is accurate finding the bound to find the lower bound on the best score look at score for the template position represented by the center of the cell subtract maximum change from the center position for any other position in cell occurs at cell corners complexities arise from determining bounds on distance 91 citation needed 93 greyscale matching edit edges are mostly robust to illumination changes however they throw away a lot of information must compute pixel distance as a function of both pixel position and pixel intensity can be applied to color also gradient matching edit another way to be robust to illumination changes without throwing away as much information is to compare image gradients matching is performed like matching greyscale images simple alternative use normalized correlation histograms of receptive field responses edit avoids explicit point correspondences relations between different image points implicitly coded in the receptive field responses swain and ballard 1991 91 2 93 schiele and crowley 2000 91 3 93 linde and lindeberg 2004 2012 91 4 93 91 5 93

object features and image features the primary constraint is that a single position of the object must account for all of the feasible matches methods that extract features from the objects to be recognized and the images to be searched surface patches corners linear edges interpretation trees edit a method for searching for feasible matches is to search through a tree each node in the tree represents a set of matches root node represents empty set each other node is the union of the matches in the parent node and one additional match wildcard is used for features with no match nodes are pruned when the set of matches is infeasible a pruned node has no children historically significant and still used but less commonly hypothesize and test edit general idea hypothesize a correspondence between a collection of image features and a collection of object features then use this to generate a hypothesis about the projection from the object coordinate frame to the image frame use this projection hypothesis to generate a rendering of the object this step is usually known as backprojection compare the rendering to the image and if the two are sufficiently similar accept the hypothesis obtaining hypothesis there are a variety of different ways of generating hypotheses when camera intrinsic parameters are known the hypothesis is equivalent to a hypothetical position and orientation pose for the object utilize geometric constraints construct a correspondence for small sets of object features to every correctly sized subset of image points these are the hypotheses three basic approaches obtaining hypotheses by pose consistency obtaining hypotheses by pose clustering obtaining hypotheses by using invariants expense search that is also redundant but can be improved using randomization and or grouping randomization examining small sets of image features until likelihood of missing object becomes small for each set of image features all possible matching sets of model features must be considered formula 1 wc k z w the fraction of image points that are good w m n c the number of correspondences necessary k the number of trials z the probability of every trial using one or more incorrect correspondences grouping if we can determine groups of points that are likely to come from the same object we can reduce the number of hypotheses that need to be examined pose consistency edit also called alignment since the object is being aligned to the image correspondences between image features and model features are not independent geometric constraints a small number of correspondences yields the object position the others must be consistent with this general idea if we hypothesize a match between a sufficiently large group of image features and a sufficiently large group of object features then we can recover the missing camera parameters from this hypothesis and so render the rest of the object strategy generate hypotheses using small number of correspondences e g triples of points for 3d recognition project other model features into image backproject and verify additional correspondences use the smallest number of correspondences necessary to achieve discrete object poses pose clustering edit general idea each object leads to many correct sets of correspondences each of which has roughly the same pose vote on pose use an accumulator array that represents pose space for each object this is essentially a hough transform strategy for each object set up an accumulator array that represents pose space each element in the accumulator array corresponds to a bucket in pose space then take each image frame group and hypothesize a correspondence between it and every frame group on every object for each of these correspondences determine pose parameters and make an entry in the accumulator array for the current object at the pose value if there are large numbers of votes in any object s accumulator array this can be interpreted as evidence for the presence of that object at that pose the evidence can be checked using a verification method note that this method uses sets of correspondences rather than individual correspondences implementation is easier since each set yields a small number of possible object poses improvement the noise resistance of this method can be improved by not counting votes for objects at poses where the vote is obviously unreliable for example in cases where if the object was at that pose the object frame group would be invisible these improvements are sufficient to yield working systems invariance edit there are geometric properties that are invariant to camera transformations most easily developed for images of planar objects but can be applied to other cases as well geometric hashing edit an algorithm that uses geometric invariants to vote for object hypotheses similar to pose clustering however instead of voting on pose we are now voting on geometry a technique originally developed for matching geometric features uncalibrated affine views of plane models against a database of such features widely used for pattern matching cad cam and medical imaging it is difficult to choose the size of the buckets it is hard to be sure what enough means therefore there may be some danger that the table will get clogged scale invariant feature transform sift edit keypoints of objects are first extracted from a set of reference images and stored in a database an object is recognized in a new image by individually comparing each feature from the new image to this database and finding candidate matching features based on euclidean distance of their feature vectors lowe 2004 91 6 93 91 7 93 speeded up robust features surf edit a robust
