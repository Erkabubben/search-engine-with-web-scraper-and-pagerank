the use of computer technology which focuses on the interfaces between people users and computers hci researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways a device that allows interaction between human being and a computer is known as a human computer interface hci as a field of research human computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science behavioral sciences design media studies and several other fields of study the term was popularized by stuart k card allen newell and thomas p moran in their 1983 book the psychology of human computer interaction the first known use was in 1975 by carlisle 91 1 93 the term is intended to convey that unlike other tools with specific and limited uses computers have many uses which often involve an open ended dialogue between the user and the computer the notion of dialogue likens human computer interaction to human to human interaction an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field 91 2 93 91 3 93 contents 1 introduction 2 human computer interface 3 goals for computers 4 design 4 1 principles 4 2

interface between the two is crucial to facilitating this interaction hci is also sometimes termed human machine interaction hmi man machine interaction mmi or computer human interaction chi desktop applications internet browsers handheld computers and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent graphical user interfaces gui of today 91 4 93 voice user interfaces vui are used for speech recognition and synthesizing systems and the emerging multi modal and graphical user interfaces gui allow humans to engage with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms the growth in human computer interaction field has led to an increase in the quality of interaction and resulted in many new areas of research beyond instead of designing regular interfaces the different research branches focus on the concepts of multimodality 91 5 93 over unimodality intelligent adaptive interfaces over command action based ones and active interfaces over passive interfaces 91 6 93 the association for computing machinery acm defines human computer interaction as a discipline that is concerned with the design evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them 91 4 93 an important facet of hci is user satisfaction or end user computing satisfaction it goes on to say because human computer interaction studies a human and a machine in communication it draws from supporting knowledge on both the machine and the human side on the machine side techniques in computer graphics operating systems programming languages and development environments are relevant on the human side communication theory graphic and industrial design disciplines linguistics social sciences cognitive psychology social psychology and human factors such as computer user satisfaction are relevant and of course engineering and design methods are relevant 91 4 93 due to the multidisciplinary nature of hci people with different backgrounds contribute to its success poorly designed human machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems a classic example is the three mile island accident a nuclear meltdown accident where investigations concluded that the design of the human machine interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 similarly accidents in aviation have resulted from manufacturers decisions to use non standard flight instruments or throttle quadrant layouts even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human machine interaction pilots had already ingrained the standard layout thus the conceptually good idea had unintended results human computer interface edit main article user interface this section

message the human computer interface can be described as the point of communication between the human user and the computer the flow of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction the loop of interaction has several aspects to it including visual based the visual based human computer interaction is probably the most widespread human computer interaction hci research area audio based the audio based interaction between a computer and a human is another important area of hci systems this area deals with information acquired by different audio signals task environment the conditions and goals set upon the user machine environment the computer s environment is connected to e g a laptop in a college student s dorm room areas of the interface non overlapping areas involve the processes related to humans and computers themselves while the overlapping areas only involve the processes related to their interaction input flow the flow of information begins in the task environment when the user has some task requiring using their computer output the flow of information that originates in the machine environment feedback loops through the interface that evaluate moderate and confirm processes as they pass from the human through the interface to the computer and back fit this matches the computer design the user and the task to optimize the human resources needed to accomplish the task goals for computers edit human computer interaction studies the ways in which humans make or do not make use of computational artifacts systems and infrastructures much of the research in this field seeks to improve the human computer interaction by improving the usability of computer interfaces 91 10 93 how usability is to be precisely understood how it relates to other social and cultural values and when it is and when it may not be a desirable property of computer interfaces is increasingly debated 91 11 93 91 12 93 much of the research in the field of human computer interaction takes an interest in methods for designing new computer interfaces thereby optimizing a design for a desired property such as learnability findability the efficiency of use methods for implementing interfaces e g by means of software libraries methods for evaluating and comparing interfaces with respect to their usability and other desirable properties methods for studying human computer use and its sociocultural implications more broadly methods for determining whether or not the user is human or computer models and theories of human computer use as well as conceptual frameworks for the design of computer interfaces such as cognitivist user models activity theory or ethnomethodological accounts of human computer use 91 13 93 perspectives that critically reflect upon the values that underlie computational design computer use and hci research practice 91 14 93 visions of what researchers in the field seek to achieve might vary when pursuing a cognitivist perspective researchers of hci may seek to align computer interfaces with the mental model that humans have of their activities when pursuing a post cognitivist perspective researchers of hci may seek to align computer interfaces with existing social practices or existing sociocultural values researchers in hci are interested in developing design methodologies experimenting with devices prototyping software and hardware systems exploring interaction paradigms and developing models and theories of interaction design edit principles edit the user interacts directly with hardware for the human input and output such as displays e g through a graphical user interface the user interacts with the computer over this software interface using the given input and output i o hardware software and hardware are matched so that the processing of the user input is fast enough and the latency of the computer output is not disruptive to the workflow the following experimental design principles are considered when evaluating a current user interface or designing a new user interface early focus is placed on the user s and task s how many users are needed to perform the task s is established and who the appropriate users should be is determined someone who has never used the interface and will not use the interface in the future is most likely not a valid user in addition the task s the users will be performing and how often the task s need to be performed is defined empirical measurement the interface is tested with real users who come in contact with the interface daily the results can vary with the performance level of the user and the typical human computer interaction may not always be represented quantitative usability specifics such as the number of users performing the task s the time to complete the task s and the number of errors made during the task s are determined iterative design after determining what users tasks and empirical measurements to include the following iterative design steps are performed design the user interface test analyze results repeat the iterative design process is repeated until a sensible user friendly interface is created 91 15 93 methodologies edit various strategies delineating methods for human pc interaction design have developed since the conception of the field during the 1980s most plan philosophies come from a model for how clients originators and specialized frameworks interface early techniques treated clients psychological procedures as unsurprising and quantifiable and urged plan specialists to look at subjective science to establish zones for example memory and consideration when structuring uis present day models in general center around a steady input and discussion between clients creators and specialists and push for specialized frameworks to be folded with the sorts of encounters clients need to have as opposed to wrapping user experience around a finished framework activity theory utilized in hci to characterize and consider the setting where human cooperations with pcs occur action hypothesis gives a structure for reasoning about activities in these specific circumstances and illuminates the design of interactions from an action driven perspective 91 16 93 user centered design ucd a cutting edge broadly rehearsed plan theory established on the possibility that clients must become the overwhelming focus in the plan of any pc framework clients architects and specialized experts cooperate to determine the requirements and restrictions of the client and make a framework to support these components frequently client focused plans are informed by ethnographic investigations of situations in which clients will associate with the framework this training is like participatory design which underscores the likelihood for end clients to contribute effectively through shared plan sessions and workshops principles of ui design these standards may be considered during the design of a client interface resistance effortlessness permeability affordance consistency structure and feedback 91 17 93 value sensitive design vsd a technique for building innovation that accounts for the individuals who utilize the design straightforwardly and just as well for those who the design influences either directly or indirectly vsd utilizes an iterative plan process that includes three kinds of examinations theoretical exact and specialized applied examinations target the understanding and articulation of the different parts of the design and its qualities or any clashes that may emerge for the users of the design exact examinations are subjective or quantitative plans to explore things used to advise the creators understanding regarding the clients qualities needs and practices specialized examinations can include either investigation of how individuals use related advances or the framework plans 91 18 93 display designs edit displays are human made artifacts designed to support the perception of relevant system variables and facilitate further processing of that information before a display is designed the task that the display is intended to support must be defined e g navigating controlling decision making learning entertaining etc a user or operator must be able to process whatever information a system generates and displays therefore the information must be displayed according to principles to support perception situation awareness and understanding thirteen principles of display design edit christopher wickens et al defined 13 principles of display design in their book an introduction to human factors engineering 91 19 93 these principles of human perception and information processing can be utilized to create an effective display design a reduction in errors a reduction in required training time an increase in efficiency and an increase in user satisfaction are a few of the many potential benefits that can be achieved by utilizing these principles certain principles may not apply to different displays or situations some principles may also appear to be conflicting and there is no simple solution to say that one principle is more important than another the principles may be tailored to a specific design or situation striking a functional balance among the principles is critical for an effective design 91 20 93 perceptual principles edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may 2021 learn how and when to remove this template message 1 make displays legible or audible a display s legibility is critical and necessary for designing a usable display if the characters or objects being displayed cannot be discernible the operator cannot effectively use them 2 avoid absolute judgment limits do not ask the user to determine the level of a variable based on a single sensory variable e g color size loudness these sensory variables can contain many possible levels 3 top down processing signals are likely perceived and interpreted by what is expected based on a user s experience if a signal is presented contrary to the user s expectation more physical evidence of that signal may need to be presented to assure that it is understood correctly 4 redundancy gain if a signal is presented more than once it is more likely to be understood correctly this can be done by presenting the signal in alternative physical forms e g color and shape voice and print etc as redundancy does not imply repetition a traffic light is a good example of redundancy as color and position are redundant 5 similarity causes confusion use distinguishable elements signals that appear to be similar will likely be confused the ratio of similar features to different features causes signals to be similar for example a423b9 is more similar to a423b8 than 92 is to 93 unnecessarily similar features should be removed and dissimilar features should be highlighted mental model principles edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may 2021 learn how and when to remove this template message 6 principle of pictorial realism a display should look like the variable that it represents e g the high temperature on a thermometer shown as a higher vertical level if there are multiple elements they can be configured in a manner that looks like they would in the represented environment 7 principle of the moving part moving elements should move in a pattern and direction compatible with the user s mental model of how it actually moves in the system for example the moving element on an altimeter should move upward with increasing altitude principles based on attention edit 8 minimizing information access cost or interaction cost when the user s attention is diverted from one location to another to access necessary information there is an associated cost in time or effort a display design should minimize this cost by allowing frequently accessed sources to be located at the nearest possible position however adequate legibility should not be sacrificed to reduce this cost 9 proximity compatibility principle divided attention between two information sources may be necessary for the completion of one task these sources must be mentally integrated and are defined to have close mental proximity information access costs should be low which can be achieved in many ways e g proximity linkage by common colors patterns shapes etc however close display proximity can be harmful by causing too much clutter 10 principle of multiple resources a user can more easily process information across different resources for example visual and auditory information can be presented simultaneously rather than presenting all visual or all auditory information memory principles edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may 2021 learn how and when to remove this template message 11 replace memory with visual information knowledge in the world a user should not need to retain important information solely in working memory or retrieve it from long term memory a menu checklist or another display can aid the user by easing the use of their memory however memory use may sometimes benefit the user by eliminating the need to reference some knowledge globally e g an expert computer operator would rather use direct commands from memory than refer to a manual the use of knowledge in a user s head and knowledge in the world must be balanced for an effective design 12 principle of predictive aiding proactive actions are usually more effective than reactive actions a display should eliminate resource demanding cognitive tasks and replace them with simpler perceptual tasks to reduce the user s mental resources this will allow the user to focus on current conditions and to consider possible future conditions an example of a predictive aid is a road sign displaying the distance to a certain destination 13 principle of consistency old habits from other displays will easily transfer to support the processing of new displays if they are designed consistently a user s long term memory will trigger actions that are expected to be appropriate a design must accept this fact and utilize consistency among different displays current research edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

edit main article social computing social computing is an interactive and collaborative behavior considered between technology and people in recent years there has been an explosion of social science research focusing on interactions as the unit of analysis as there are a lot of social computing technologies that include blogs emails social networking quick messaging and various others much of this research draws from psychology social psychology and sociology for example one study found out that people expected a computer with a man s name to cost more than a machine with a woman s name 91 21 93 other research finds that individuals perceive their interactions with computers more negatively than humans despite behaving the same way towards these machines 91 22 93 knowledge driven human computer interaction edit in human and computer interactions a semantic gap usually exists between human and computer s understandings towards mutual behaviors ontology as a formal representation of domain specific knowledge can be used to address this problem by solving the semantic ambiguities between the two parties 91 23 93 emotions and human computer interaction edit main articles affective computing and emotion recognition in the interaction of humans and computers research has studied how computers can detect process and react to human emotions to develop emotionally intelligent information systems researchers have suggested several affect detection channels the potential of telling human emotions in an automated and digital fashion lies in improvements to the effectiveness of human computer interaction the influence of emotions in human computer interaction has been studied in fields such as financial decision making using ecg and organizational knowledge sharing using eye tracking and face readers as affect detection channels in these fields it has been shown that affect detection channels have the potential to detect human emotions and those information systems can incorporate the data obtained from affect detection channels to improve decision models brain computer interfaces edit main article brain computer interface a brain computer interface bci is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device bci differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bidirectional information flow bcis are often directed at researching mapping assisting augmenting or repairing human cognitive or sensory motor functions 91 24 93 security interactions edit security interactions are the study of interaction between humans and computers specifically as it pertains to information security its aim in plain terms is to improve the usability of security features in end user applications unlike hci which has roots in the early days of xerox parc during the 1970s hcisec is a nascent field of study by comparison interest in this topic tracks with that of internet security which has become an area of broad public concern only in very recent years when security features exhibit poor usability the following are common reasons they were added in casual afterthought they were hastily patched in to address newly discovered security bugs they address very complex use cases without the benefit of a software wizard their interface designers lacked understanding of related security concepts their interface designers were not usability experts often meaning they were the application developers themselves factors of change edit traditionally computer use was modeled as a human computer dyad in which the two were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel such as text based terminals much work has been done to make the interaction between a computing system and a human more reflective of the multidimensional nature of everyday communication because of potential issues human computer interaction shifted focus beyond the interface to respond to observations as articulated by d engelbart if ease of use were the only valid criterion people would stick to tricycles and never try bicycles 91 25 93 how humans interact with computers continues to evolve rapidly human computer interaction is affected by developments in computing these forces include decreasing hardware costs leading to larger memory and faster systems miniaturization of hardware leading to portability reduction in power requirements leading to portability new display technologies leading to the packaging of computational devices in new forms specialized hardware leading to new functions increased development of network communication and distributed computing increasingly widespread use of computers especially by people who are outside of the computing profession increasing innovation in input techniques e g voice gesture pen combined with lowering cost leading to rapid computerization by people formerly left out of the computer revolution wider social concerns leading to improved access to computers by currently disadvantaged groups as of 2010 91 update 93 the future for hci is expected 91 26 93 to include the following characteristics ubiquitous computing and communication computers are expected to communicate through high speed local networks nationally over wide area networks and portably via infrared ultrasonic cellular and other technologies data and computational services will be portably accessible from many if not most locations to which a user travels high functionality systems systems can have large numbers of functions associated with them there are so many systems that most users technical or non technical do not have time to learn about traditionally e g through thick user manuals the mass availability of computer graphics computer graphics capabilities such as image processing graphics transformations rendering and interactive animation become widespread as inexpensive chips become available for inclusion in general workstations and mobile devices mixed media commercial systems can handle images voice sounds video text formatted data these are exchangeable over communication links among users the separate consumer electronics fields e g stereo sets dvd players televisions and computers are beginning to merge computer and print fields are expected to cross assimilate high bandwidth interaction the rate at which humans and machines interact is expected to increase substantially due to the changes in speed computer graphics new media and new input output devices this can lead to qualitatively different interfaces such as virtual reality or computational video large and thin displays new display technologies are maturing enabling huge displays and displays that are thin lightweight and low in power use this has large effects on portability and will likely enable developing paper like pen based computer interaction systems very different in feel from present desktop workstations information utilities public information utilities such as home banking and shopping and specialized industry services e g weather for pilots are expected to proliferate the proliferation rate can accelerate with the introduction of high bandwidth interaction and the improvement in the quality of interfaces scientific conferences edit one of the main conferences for new research in human computer interaction is the annually held
