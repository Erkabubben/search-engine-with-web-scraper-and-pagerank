artificial intelligence programming competition created by two sigma in 2016 libratus a poker ai that beat world class poker players in 2017 intended to be generalisable to other applications the matchbox educable noughts and crosses engine sometimes called the machine educable noughts and crosses engine or menace was a mechanical computer made from 304 matchboxes designed and built by artificial intelligence researcher donald michie in 1961 quick draw an online game developed by google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a neural network to guess what the drawing is the samuel checkers playing program 1959 was among the world s first successful self learning programs and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of
