question answering from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search for other uses see question and answer computer science discipline question answering qa is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing nlp which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language 91 1 93 contents 1 overview 2 types of question answering 3 history 4 applications 5 architecture 6 question answering methods 6 1 open domain question answering 6 2 mathematical question answering 7 progress 8 references 9 further reading 10 external links overview edit a question answering implementation usually a computer program may construct its answers by querying a structured database of knowledge or information usually a knowledge base more commonly question answering systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents some examples of natural language document collections used for question answering systems include a local collection of reference texts internal organization documents and web pages compiled newswire reports a set of wikipedia pages a subset of world wide web pages types of question answering edit question answering research attempts to deal with a wide range of question types including fact list definition how why hypothetical semantically constrained and cross lingual questions answering questions related to an article in order to evaluate reading comprehension this is a simpler form of question answering since the given article is relatively short compared to other types of question answering problems dealing with larger domain of information an example of an open domain question is what did albert einstein win the nobel prize for while an article about this subject is given to the system closed book question answering a system has memorized some facts during training and can answer questions without explicitly given a context this is similar to humans taking closed book exams closed domain question answering deals with questions under a specific domain for example medicine or automotive maintenance and can exploit domain specific knowledge frequently formalized in ontologies alternatively closed domain might refer to a situation where only a limited type of questions are accepted such as questions asking for descriptive rather than procedural information question answering systems in the context of machine reading applications have also been constructed in the medical domain for instance related to alzheimer s disease 91 2 93 open domain question answering deals with questions about nearly anything and can only rely on general ontologies and world knowledge on the other hand these systems usually have much more data available from which to extract the answer an example of an open domain question is what did albert einstein win the nobel prize for while no article about this subject is given to the system another way to categorize question answering systems is to use the technical approached used there are a number of different types of qa systems including rule based systems statistical systems and hybrid systems rule based systems use a set of rules to determine the correct answer to a question statistical systems use statistical methods to find the most likely answer to a question hybrid systems use a combination of rule based and statistical methods history edit two early question answering systems were baseball 91 3 93 and lunar 91 4 93 baseball answered questions about major league baseball league over a period of one year lunar in turn answered questions about the geological analysis of rocks returned by the apollo moon missions both question answering systems were very effective in their chosen domains in fact lunar was demonstrated at a lunar science convention in 1971 and it was able to answer 90 of the questions in its domain posed by people untrained on the system further restricted domain question answering systems were developed in the following years the common feature of all these systems is that they had a core database or knowledge system that was hand written by experts of the chosen domain the language abilities of baseball and lunar used techniques similar to eliza and doctor the first chatterbot programs shrdlu was a highly successful question answering program developed by terry winograd in the late 1960s and early 1970s it simulated the operation of a robot in a toy world the blocks world and it offered the possibility of asking the robot questions about the state of the world again the strength of this system was the choice of a very specific domain and a very simple world with rules of physics that were easy to encode in a computer program in the 1970s knowledge bases were developed that targeted narrower domains of knowledge the question answering systems developed to interface with these expert systems produced more repeatable and valid responses to questions within an area of knowledge these expert systems closely resembled modern question answering systems except in their internal architecture expert systems rely heavily on expert constructed and organized knowledge bases whereas many modern question answering systems rely on statistical processing of a large unstructured natural language text corpus the 1970s and 1980s saw the development of comprehensive theories in computational linguistics which led to the development of ambitious projects in text comprehension and question answering one example of such a system was the unix consultant uc developed by robert wilensky at u c berkeley in the late 1980s the system answered questions pertaining to the unix operating system it had a comprehensive hand crafted knowledge base of its domain and it aimed at phrasing the answer to accommodate various types of users another project was lilog a text understanding system that operated on the domain of tourism information in a german city the systems developed in the uc and lilog projects never went past the stage of simple demonstrations but they helped the development of theories on computational linguistics and reasoning specialized natural language question answering systems have been developed such as eagli for health and life scientists 91 5 93 applications edit qa systems are used in a variety of applications including fact checking if a fact is verified by posing a question like is fact x true or false customer service technical support market research generate reports or conduct research architecture edit as of 2001 question answering systems typically included a question classifier module that determines the type of question and the type of answer 91 6 93 different types of question answering systems employ different architectures for example modern open domain question answering systems may use a retriever reader architecture the retriever is aimed at retrieving relevant documents related to a given question while the reader is used for inferring the answer from the retrieved documents latest systems such as gpt 3 t5 91 7 93 and bart 91 8 93 even use an end to end architecture in which a transformer based architecture is used to store large scale textual data in the underlying parameters these models can then be directly used to answer questions without accessing any external knowledge sources question answering methods edit question answering is very dependent on a good search corpus for without documents containing the answer there is little any question answering system can do it thus makes sense that larger collection sizes generally lend well to better question answering performance unless the question domain is orthogonal to the collection the notion of data redundancy in massive collections such as the web means that nuggets of information are likely to be phrased in many different ways in differing contexts and documents 91 9 93 leading to two benefits by having the right information appear in many forms the burden on the question answering system to perform complex nlp techniques to understand the text is lessened correct answers can be filtered from false positives by relying on the correct answer to appear more times in the documents than instances of incorrect ones some question answering systems rely heavily on automated reasoning 91 10 93 91 11 93 open domain question answering edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message in information retrieval an open domain question answering system aims at returning an answer in response to the user s question the returned answer is in the form of short texts rather than a list of relevant documents 91 12 93 the system uses a combination of techniques from computational linguistics information retrieval and knowledge representation for finding answers the system takes a natural language question as an input rather than a set of keywords for example when is the national day of china the sentence is then transformed into a query through its logical form having the input in the form of a natural language question makes the system more user friendly but harder to implement as there are various question types and the system will have to identify the correct one in order to give a sensible answer assigning a question type to the question is a crucial task the entire answer extraction process relies on finding the correct question type and hence the correct answer type keyword extraction is the first step for identifying the input question type 91 13 93 in some cases there are clear words that indicate the question type directly i e who where or how many these words tell the system that the answers should be of type person location or number respectively in the example above the word when indicates that the answer should be of type date pos part of speech tagging and syntactic parsing techniques can also be used to determine the answer type in this case the subject is chinese national day the predicate is is and the adverbial modifier is when therefore the answer type is date unfortunately some interrogative words like which what or how do not give clear answer types each of these words can represent more than one type in situations like this other words in the question need to be considered first thing to do is to find the words that can indicate the meaning of the question a lexical dictionary such as wordnet can then be used for understanding the context once the question type has been identified an information retrieval system is used to find a set of documents containing the correct keywords a tagger and np verb group chunker can be used to verify whether the correct entities and relations are mentioned in the found documents for questions such as who or where a named entity recogniser is used to find relevant person and location names from the retrieved documents only the relevant paragraphs are selected for ranking a vector space model can be used as a strategy for classifying the candidate answers check if the answer is of the correct type as determined in the question type analysis stage an inference technique can also be used to validate the candidate answers a score is then given to each of these candidates according to the number of question words it contains and how close these words are to the candidate the more and the closer the better the answer is then translated into a compact and meaningful representation by parsing in the previous example the expected output answer is 1st oct mathematical question answering edit an open source math aware question answering system based on ask platypus and wikidata was published in 2018 91 14 93 the system takes an english or hindi natural language question as input and returns a mathematical formula retrieved from wikidata as succinct answer the resulting formula is translated into a computable form allowing the user to insert values for the variables names and values of variables and common constants are retrieved from wikidata if available it is claimed that the system outperforms a commercial computational mathematical knowledge engine on a test set mathqa is hosted by wikimedia at https mathqa wmflabs org in 2022 it was extended to answer 15 math question types 91 15 93 mathqa methods need to combine natural and formula language one possible approach is to perform supervised annotation via entity linking the arqmath task at clef 2020 91 16 93 was launched to address the problem of linking newly posted questions from the platform math stack exchange mse to existing ones that were already answered by the community 91 17 93 the lab was motivated by the fact that mansouri et al discovered that 20 of the mathematical queries in general purpose search engines are expressed as well formed questions 91 18 93 it contained two separate sub tasks task 1 answer retrieval matching old post answers to newly posed questions and task 2 formula retrieval matching old post formulae to new questions starting with the domain of mathematics which involves formula language the goal is to later extend the task to other domains e g stem disciplines such as chemistry biology etc which employ other types of special notation e g chemical formulae 91 16 93 91 17 93 moreover also the inverse process of mathematical question answering i e mathematical question generation has researched the physwikiquiz physics question generation and test engine retrieves mathematical formulae from wikidata together with semantic information of their constituting identifiers names and values of variables 91 19 93 the formuale are then rearranged to generate a set of formula variants subsequently the variables are substitued with random values to generate a large number of different questions suitable for individual student tests physwikiquiz is hosted by wikimedia at https physwikiquiz wmflabs org progress edit question answering systems have been extended in recent years to encompass additional domains of knowledge 91 20 93 for example systems have been developed to automatically answer temporal and geospatial questions questions of definition and terminology biographical questions multilingual questions and questions about the content of audio images 91 21 93 and video 91 22 93 current question answering research topics include interactivity clarification of questions or answers 91 23 93 answer reuse or caching 91 24 93 semantic parsing 91 25 93 answer presentation 91 26 93 knowledge representation and semantic entailment 91 27 93 social media analysis with question answering systems sentiment analysis 91 28 93 utilization of thematic roles 91 29 93 image captioning for visual question answering 91 21 93 embodied question answering 91 30 93 in 2011 watson a question answering computer system developed by ibm competed in two exhibition matches of jeopardy against brad rutter and ken jennings winning by a significant margin 91 31 93 facebook research has made their drqa system 91 32 93 available under an open source license this system has been used for open domain question answering using wikipedia as knowledge source 91 33 93 the open source framework haystack by deepset allows combining open domain question answering with generative question answering and supports the domain adaptation of the underlying language models for industry use cases 91 34 93 91 35 93 references edit philipp cimiano christina
