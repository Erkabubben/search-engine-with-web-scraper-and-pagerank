resolved some sources claim the term was coined by pythagoras c 8201 570 160 c 8201 495 bce 91 8 93 91 9 93 although this theory is disputed by some 91 10 93 91 11 93 91 12 93 philosophical methods include questioning critical discussion rational argument and systematic presentation 91 13 93 91 14 93 91 i 93 historically philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher 91 15 93 natural philosophy which began as a discipline in ancient india and ancient greece encompasses astronomy medicine and physics 91 16 93 91 17 93 for example newton s 1687 mathematical principles of natural philosophy later became classified as a book of physics in the 19th century the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize 91 18 93 91 19 93 since then various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines and namely the social sciences such as psychology sociology linguistics and economics today major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality epistemology which studies the nature of knowledge and belief ethics which is concerned with moral value and logic which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises 91 20 93 91 21 93 other notable subfields include philosophy of religion philosophy of science political philosophy aesthetics philosophy of language and philosophy of mind contents 1

reference works 9 external links definitions main article definitions of philosophy there is wide agreement that philosophy from the ancient greek ph los love and soph a wisdom 91 22 93 is characterized by various general features it is a form of rational inquiry it aims to be systematic and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions 91 23 93 91 24 93 91 25 93 but approaches that go beyond such vague characterizations to give a more interesting or profound definition are usually controversial 91 24 93 91 25 93 often they are only accepted by theorists belonging to a certain philosophical movement and are revisionistic in that many presumed parts of philosophy would not deserve the title philosophy if they were true 91 26 93 91 27 93 before the modern age the term was used in a very wide sense which included the individual sciences like physics or mathematics as its sub disciplines but the contemporary usage is more narrow 91 25 93 91 28 93 91 29 93 some approaches argue that there is a set of essential features shared by all parts of philosophy while others see only weaker family resemblances or contend that it is merely an empty blanket term 91 30 93 91 27 93 91 31 93 some definitions characterize philosophy in relation to its method like pure reasoning others focus more on its topic for example as the study of the biggest patterns of the world as a whole or as the attempt to answer the big questions 91 27 93 91 32 93 91 33 93 both approaches have the problem that they are usually either too wide by including non philosophical disciplines or too narrow by excluding some philosophical sub disciplines 91 27 93 many definitions of philosophy emphasize its intimate relation to science 91 25 93 in this sense philosophy is sometimes understood as a proper science in its own right some naturalist approaches for example see philosophy as an empirical yet very abstract science that is concerned with very wide ranging empirical patterns instead of particular observations 91 27 93 91 34 93 some phenomenologists on the other hand characterize philosophy as the science of essences 91 26 93 91 35 93 91 36 93 science based definitions usually face the problem of explaining why philosophy in its long history has not made the type of progress as seen in other sciences 91 27 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 this problem is avoided by seeing philosophy as an immature or provisional science whose subdisciplines cease to be philosophy once they have fully developed 91 25 93 91 30 93 91 35 93 in this sense philosophy is the midwife of the sciences 91 25 93 other definitions focus more on the contrast between science and philosophy a common theme among many such definitions is that philosophy is concerned with meaning understanding or the clarification of language 91 32 93 91 27 93 according to one view philosophy is conceptual analysis which involves finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of concepts 91 33 93 91 27 93 91 39 93 another defines philosophy as a linguistic therapy that aims at dispelling misunderstandings to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of natural language 91 26 93 91 25 93 91 40 93 one more approach holds that the main task of philosophy is to articulate the pre ontological understanding of the world which acts as a condition of possibility of experience 91 27 93 91 41 93 91 42 93 many other definitions of philosophy do not clearly fall into any of the aforementioned categories an early approach already found in ancient greek and roman philosophy is that philosophy is the spiritual practice of developing one s reasoning ability 91 43 93 91 44 93 this practice is an expression of the philosopher s love of wisdom and has the aim of improving one s well being by leading a reflective life 91 45 93 a closely related approach identifies the development and articulation of worldviews as the principal task of philosophy i e to express how things on the grand scale hang together and which practical stance we should take towards them 91 27 93 91 23 93 91 46 93 another definition characterizes philosophy as thinking about thinking in order to emphasize its reflective nature 91 27 93 91 33 93 historical overview this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by

concerns while also retaining a continuity with greco roman thought problems such as the existence and nature of god the nature of faith and reason metaphysics and the problem of evil were discussed in this period some key medieval thinkers include st augustine thomas aquinas boethius anselm and roger bacon philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to theology ancilla theologiae and

spinoza leibniz locke berkeley hume and kant 19th century philosophy sometimes called late modern philosophy was influenced by the wider 18th century movement termed the enlightenment and includes figures such as hegel a key figure in german idealism kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism thomas carlyle representative of the great man theory nietzsche a famed anti

akhenaten 14th century bce which held that the solar creation deity aten was the only god this has been described as a monotheistic revolution by egyptologist jan assmann though it also drew on previous developments in egyptian thought particularly the new solar theology based around amun ra 91 57 93 91 58 93 these theological developments also influenced the post amarna ramesside theology

sensori emotional values sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste 91 126 93 its major divisions are art theory literary theory film theory and music theory an example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the cubist aesthetic 91 127 93 ethics main article ethics the utilitarian doctrine is that happiness is desirable and the only thing desirable as an end all other things being only desirable as means to that end john stuart mill utilitarianism 1863 91 128 93 ethics also known as moral philosophy studies what constitutes good and bad conduct right and wrong values and good and evil its primary investigations include exploring how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality it also includes investigating whether there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard and if so how we come to learn about it the main branches of ethics are normative ethics meta ethics and applied ethics 91 129 93 the three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are 91 129 93 consequentialism which judges actions based on their consequences 91 130 93 one such view is utilitarianism which judges actions based on the net happiness or pleasure and or lack of suffering or pain that they produce deontology which judges actions based on whether they are in accordance with one s moral duty 91 130 93 in the standard form defended by immanuel kant deontology is concerned with whether a choice respects the moral agency of other people regardless of its consequences 91 130 93 virtue ethics which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do 91 130 93 epistemology main article epistemology dignaga founded a school of buddhist epistemology and logic epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge 91 131 93 epistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge including perceptual experience reason memory and testimony they also investigate questions about the nature of truth belief justification and rationality 91 132 93 philosophical skepticism which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge has been a topic of interest throughout the history of philosophy it arose early in pre socratic philosophy and became formalized with pyrrho the founder of the earliest western school of philosophical skepticism it features prominently in the works of modern philosophers ren descartes and david hume and has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates 91 132 93 one of the most notable epistemological debates is between empiricism and rationalism 91 133 93 empiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge 91 133 93 empiricism is associated with a posteriori knowledge which is obtained through experience such as scientific knowledge 91 133 93 rationalism places emphasis on reason as a source of knowledge 91 133 93 rationalism is associated with a priori knowledge which is independent of experience such as logic and mathematics one central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge which might include truth and justification this debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the gettier problem 91 132 93 another common subject of contemporary debates is the regress problem which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief statement or proposition the problem is that whatever the source of justification may be that source must either be without justification in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary foundation for belief or it must have some further justification in which case justification must either be the result of circular reasoning as in coherentism or the result of an infinite regress as in infinitism 91 132 93 metaphysics main article metaphysics the beginning of aristotle s metaphysics in an incunabulum decorated with hand painted miniatures metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality such as existence time objects and their properties wholes and their parts events processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body 91 134 93 metaphysics includes cosmology the study of the world in its entirety and ontology the study of being along with the philosophy of space and time a major point of debate is between realism which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and idealism which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial metaphysics deals with the topic of identity essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has without which the object can still retain its identity particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time as opposed to abstract objects such as numbers and universals which are properties held by multiple particulars such as redness or a gender the type of existence if any of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate logic main article logic logic is the study of reasoning and argument deductive reasoning is when given certain premises conclusions are unavoidably implied 91 135 93 rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as modus ponens where given a and if a then b then b must be concluded because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences 91 136 93 social sciences and humanities disciplines logic became a formal science sub fields include mathematical logic philosophical logic modal logic computational logic and non classical logics a major question in the philosophy of mathematics is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered called mathematical realism or invented called mathematical antirealism mind and language main articles philosophy of language and philosophy of mind philosophy of language explores the nature origins and use of language philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body as typified by disputes between materialism and dualism in recent years this branch has become related to cognitive science philosophy of science main article philosophy of science the philosophy of science explores the foundations methods history implications and purpose of science many of its subdivisions correspond to specific branches of science for example philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences political philosophy main article political philosophy thomas hobbes best known for his 1651 book leviathan which expounded an influential formulation of social contract theory political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals or families and clans to communities including the state it includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen political philosophy ethics and aesthetics are traditionally linked subjects under the general heading of value theory as they involve a normative or evaluative aspect 91 137 93 philosophy of religion main article philosophy of religion philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve religion and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective as opposed to theology which begins from religious convictions 91 138 93 traditionally religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper and the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century 91 v 93 issues include the existence of god the relationship between reason and faith questions of religious epistemology the relationship between religion and science how to interpret religious experiences questions about the possibility of an afterlife the problem of religious language and the existence of souls and responses to religious pluralism and diversity metaphilosophy main article metaphilosophy metaphilosophy explores the aims boundaries and methods of philosophy it is debated as to whether metaphilosophy is a subject that comes prior to philosophy 91 139 93 or whether it is inherently part of philosophy 91 140 93 other subdivisions in section thirteen of his lives and opinions of the eminent philosophers the oldest surviving history of philosophy 3rd century diogenes la rtius presents a three part division of ancient greek philosophical inquiry 91 141 93 natural philosophy i e physics from greek ta physika lit 8201 39 things having to do with physis nature 39 was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world 91 142 93 moral philosophy i e ethics from thika 39 having to do with character disposition manners 39 was the study of goodness right and wrong justice and virtue 91 143 93 metaphysical philosophy i e logic from logik s 39 of or pertaining to reason or speech 39 was the study of existence causation god logic forms and other abstract objects meta ta physika 39 after the physics 39 in against the logicians the pyrrhonist philosopher sextus empiricus detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient greek philosophers had divided philosophy noting that this three part division was agreed to by plato aristotle xenocrates and the stoics 91 144 93 the academic skeptic philosopher cicero also followed this three part division 91 145 93 this division is not obsolete but has changed natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences especially physics astronomy chemistry biology and cosmology moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences while still including value theory e g ethics aesthetics political philosophy etc and metaphysical philosophy has given way to formal sciences such as logic mathematics and philosophy of science while still including epistemology cosmology etc for example newton s mathematical principles of natural philosophy 1687 since classified as a book of physics uses the term natural philosophy as it was understood at the time encompassing disciplines such as astronomy medicine and physics that later became associated with the sciences 91 16 93 methods of philosophy main article philosophical methodology methods of philosophy are ways of conducting philosophical inquiry they include techniques for arriving at philosophical knowledge and justifying philosophical claims as well as principles used for choosing between competing theories 91 146 93 91 147 93 91 148 93 a great variety of methods has been employed throughout the history of philosophy many of them differ significantly from the methods used in the natural sciences in that they do not use experimental data obtained through measuring equipment 91 149 93 91 150 93 91 151 93 the choice of one s method usually has important implications both for how philosophical theories are constructed and for the arguments cited for or against them 91 147 93 91 152 93 91 153 93 this choice is often guided by epistemological considerations about what constitutes philosophical evidence how much support it offers and how to acquire it 91 149 93 91 147 93 91 154 93 various disagreements on the level of philosophical theories have their source in methodological disagreements and the discovery of new methods has often had important consequences both for how philosophers conduct their research and for what claims they defend 91 155 93 91 148 93 91 147 93 some philosophers engage in most of their theorizing using one particular method while others employ a wider range of methods based on which one fits the specific problem investigated best 91 150 93 91 156 93 methodological skepticism is a prominent method of philosophy it aims to arrive at absolutely certain first principles by using systematic doubt to determine which principles of philosophy are indubitable 91 157 93 the geometrical method tries to build a comprehensive philosophical system based on a small set of such axioms it does so with the help of deductive reasoning to expand the certainty of its axioms to the system as a whole 91 158 93 91 159 93 phenomenologists seek certain knowledge about the realm of appearances they do so by suspending their judgments about the external world in order to focus on how things appear independent of their underlying reality a technique known as epoch 91 160 93 91 148 93 conceptual analysis is a well known method in analytic philosophy it aims to clarify the meaning of concepts by analyzing them into their fundamental constituents 91 161 93 91 39 93 91 23 93 another method often employed in analytic philosophy is based on common sense it starts with commonly accepted beliefs and tries to draw interesting conclusions from them which it often employs in a negative sense to criticize philosophical theories that are too far removed from how the average person sees the issue 91 151 93 91 162 93 91 163 93 it is very similar to how ordinary language philosophy tackles philosophical questions by investigating how ordinary language is used 91 148 93 91 164 93 91 165 93 various methods in philosophy give particular importance to intuitions i e non inferential impressions about the correctness of specific claims or general principles 91 155 93 91 166 93 for example they play an important role in thought experiments which employ counterfactual thinking to evaluate the possible consequences of an imagined situation these anticipated consequences can then be used to confirm or refute philosophical theories 91 167 93 91 168 93 91 161 93 the method of reflective equilibrium also employs intuitions it seeks to form a coherent position on a certain issue by examining all the relevant beliefs and intuitions some of which often have to be deemphasized or reformulated in order to arrive at a coherent perspective 91 155 93 91 169 93 91 170 93 pragmatists stress the significance of concrete practical consequences for assessing whether a philosophical theory is true or false 91 171 93 91 172 93 experimental philosophy is of rather recent origin its methods differ from most other methods of philosophy in that it tries to answer philosophical questions by gathering empirical data in ways similar to social psychology and the cognitive sciences 91 173 93 91 174 93 philosophical progress many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today british philosopher colin mcginn claims that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval 91 175 93 australian philosopher david chalmers by contrast sees progress in philosophy similar to that in science 91 176 93 meanwhile talbot brewer professor of philosophy at university of virginia argues that progress is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity 91 177 93 applied and professional philosophy martin luther king jr main article contemporary philosophy 160 outside the profession some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers typically by working as professors who teach research and write in academic institutions 91 178 93 however most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law journalism religion sciences politics business or various arts 91 179 93 91 180 93 for example public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians steve martin and ricky gervais filmmaker terrence malick pope john paul ii wikipedia co founder larry sanger technology entrepreneur peter thiel u s supreme court justice stephen breyer jeopardy host alex trebek and us vice presidential candidate carly fiorina 91 181 93 91 182 93 curtis white has argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities sciences and social sciences 91 183 93 recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the million dollar berggruen prize first awarded to charles taylor in 2016 91 184 93 some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline 91 185 93 women in philosophy main article women in philosophy mary wollstonecraft 1759 1797 was an english writer and philosopher although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse women philosophers have engaged in the discipline throughout history the list of female philosophers throughout history is vast ancient examples include hipparchia of maroneia active c 8201 325 bce and arete of cyrene active 5th 4th centuries bce some women philosophers were accepted during the medieval and modern eras but none became part of the western canon until the 20th and 21st century when many suggest that g e m anscombe hannah arendt bell hooks simone de beauvoir simone weil and susanne langer entered the canon 91 186 93 91 187 93 91 188 93 in the early 1800s some colleges and universities in the uk and the us began admitting women producing more female academics nevertheless u s department of education reports from the 1990s indicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least gender proportionate fields in the humanities with women making up somewhere between 17 and 30 of philosophy faculty according to some studies 91 189 93 prominent 21st century philosophers include judith butler gayatri

considered and called wise men and that name of theirs continued to the age of pythagoras who is reported to have gone to phlius as we find it stated by heraclides ponticus a very learned man and a pupil of plato and to have discoursed very learnedly and copiously on certain subjects with leon prince of the phliasii and when leon admiring his ingenuity and eloquence asked him what art he particularly professed his answer was that he was acquainted with no art but that he was a philosopher leon surprised at the novelty of the name inquired what he meant by the name of philosopher and in what philosophers differed from other men on which pythagoras replied that the life of man seemed to him to resemble those games which were celebrated with the 166greatest possible variety of sports and the general concourse of all greece for as in those games there were some persons whose object was glory and the honor of a crown to be attained by the performance of bodily exercises so others were led thither by the gain of buying and selling and mere views of profit but there was likewise one class of persons and they were by far the best whose aim was neither applause nor profit but who came merely as spectators through curiosity to observe what was done and to see in what manner things were carried on there and thus said he we come from another life and nature unto this one just as men come out of some other city to some much frequented mart some being slaves to glory others to money and there are some few who taking no account of anything else earnestly look into the nature of things and these men call themselves studious of wisdom that is philosophers and as there it is the most reputable occupation of all to be a looker on without making any acquisition so in
