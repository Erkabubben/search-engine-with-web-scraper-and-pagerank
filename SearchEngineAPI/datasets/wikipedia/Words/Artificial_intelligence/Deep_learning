as deep structured learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning learning can be supervised semi supervised or unsupervised 91 2 93 deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks deep belief networks deep reinforcement learning recurrent neural networks convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing machine translation bioinformatics drug design medical image analysis climate science material inspection and board game programs where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance 91 3 93 91 4 93 91 5 93 artificial neural networks anns were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems anns have various differences from biological brains specifically artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic plastic and analog 91 6 93 91 7 93 the adjective deep in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can deep learning is a modern variation which is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size which permits practical application and optimized implementation while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions in deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models for the sake of efficiency

199 200 8202 uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces overview edit most modern deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks specifically convolutional neural networks cnn s although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines 91 9 93 in deep learning each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation in an image recognition application the raw input may be a matrix of pixels the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges the third layer may encode a nose and eyes and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face importantly a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own this does not eliminate the need for hand tuning for example varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction 91 10 93 91 11 93 the word deep in deep learning refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed more precisely deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path cap depth the cap is the chain of transformations from input to output caps describe potentially causal connections between input and output for a feedforward neural network the depth of the caps is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one as the output layer is also parameterized for recurrent neural networks in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once the cap depth is potentially unlimited 91 12 93 no universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning but most researchers agree that deep learning involves cap depth higher than 2 cap of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function 91 13 93 beyond that more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network deep models cap gt 2 are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence extra layers help in learning the features effectively deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer by layer method 91 14 93 deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance 91 10 93 for supervised learning tasks deep learning methods eliminate feature engineering by translating the data into compact intermediate representations akin to principal components and derive layered structures that remove redundancy in representation deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks this is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks 91 10 93 91 15 93 interpretations edit deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 or probabilistic inference 91 21 93 91 8 93 91 10 93 91 12 93 91 22 93 the classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 in 1989 the first proof was published by george cybenko for sigmoid activation functions 91 16 93 and was generalised to feed forward multi layer architectures in 1991 by kurt hornik 91 17 93 recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non bounded activation functions such as the rectified linear unit 91 23 93 the universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow lu et al 91 20 93 proved that if the width of a deep neural network with relu activation is strictly larger than the input dimension then the network can approximate any lebesgue integrable function if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator the probabilistic interpretation 91 22 93 derives from the field of machine learning it features inference 91 8 93 91 9 93 91 10 93 91 12 93 91 15 93 91 22 93 as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing related to fitting and generalization respectively more specifically the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function 91 22 93 the probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks the probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including hopfield widrow and narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by bishop 91 24 93 history edit some sources point out that frank rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today 91 25 93 he described it in his book principles of neurodynamics perceptrons and the theory of brain mechanisms published by cornell aeronautical laboratory inc cornell university in 1962 the first general working learning algorithm for supervised deep feedforward multilayer perceptrons was published by alexey ivakhnenko and lapa in 1967 91 26 93 a 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling 91 27 93 other deep learning working architectures specifically those built for computer vision began with the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in 1980 91 28 93 the term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in 1986 91 29 93 and to artificial neural networks by igor aizenberg and colleagues in 2000 in the context of boolean threshold neurons 91 30 93 91 31 93 in 1989 yann lecun et al applied the standard backpropagation algorithm which had been around as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation since 1970 91 32 93 91 33 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 to a deep neural network with the purpose of recognizing handwritten zip codes on mail while the algorithm worked training required 3 days 91 36 93 independently in 1988 wei zhang et al applied the backpropagation algorithm to a convolutional neural network a simplified neocognitron by keeping only the convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer for alphabets recognition and also proposed an implementation of the cnn with an optical computing system 91 37 93 91 38 93 subsequently wei zhang et al modified the model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in 1991 91 39 93 and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994 91 40 93 in 1994 andr de carvalho together with mike fairhurst and david bisset published experimental results of a multi layer boolean neural network also known as a weightless neural network composed of a 3 layers self organising feature extraction neural network module soft followed by a multi layer classification neural network module gsn which were independently trained each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer 91 41 93 in 1995 brendan frey demonstrated that it was possible to train over two days a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake sleep algorithm co developed with peter dayan and hinton 91 42 93 many factors contribute to the slow speed including the vanishing gradient problem analyzed in 1991 by sepp hochreiter 91 43 93 91 44 93 since 1997 sven behnke extended the feed forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the neural abstraction pyramid 91 45 93 by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities simpler models that use task specific handcrafted features such as gabor filters and support vector machines svms were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s because of artificial neural network s ann computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks both shallow and deep learning e g recurrent nets of anns have been explored for many years 91 46 93 91 47 93 91 48 93 these methods never outperformed non uniform internal handcrafting gaussian mixture model hidden markov model gmm hmm technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively 91 49 93 key difficulties have been analyzed including gradient diminishing 91 43 93 and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models 91 50 93 91 51 93 additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling an exception was at sri international in the late 1990s funded by the us government s nsa and darpa sri studied deep neural networks in speech and speaker recognition the speaker recognition team led by larry heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 national institute of standards and technology speaker recognition evaluation 91 52 93 the sri deep neural network was then deployed in the nuance verifier representing the first major industrial application of deep learning 91 53 93 the principle of elevating raw features over hand crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the raw spectrogram or linear filter bank features in the late 1990s 91 53 93 showing its superiority over the mel cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms the raw features of speech waveforms later produced excellent larger scale results 91 54 93 many aspects of speech recognition were taken over by a deep learning method called long short term memory lstm a recurrent neural network published by hochreiter and schmidhuber in 1997 91 55 93 lstm rnns avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn very deep learning tasks 91 12 93 that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before which is important for speech in 2003 lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks 91 56 93 later it was combined with connectionist temporal classification ctc 91 57 93 in stacks of lstm rnns 91 58 93 in 2015 google s speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49 through ctc trained lstm which they made available through google voice search 91 59 93 in 2006 publications by geoff hinton ruslan salakhutdinov osindero and teh 91 60 93 91 61 93 91 62 93 showed how a many layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre trained one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then fine tuning it using supervised backpropagation 91 63 93 the papers referred to learning for deep belief nets deep learning is part of state of the art systems in various disciplines particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition asr results on commonly used evaluation sets such as timit asr and mnist image classification as well as a range of large vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved 91 64 93 91 65 93 convolutional neural networks cnns were superseded for asr by ctc 91 57 93 for lstm 91 55 93 91 59 93 91 66 93 91 67 93 91 68 93 but are more successful in computer vision the impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s when cnns already processed an estimated 10 to 20 of all the checks written in the us according to yann lecun 91 69 93 industrial applications of deep learning to large scale speech recognition started around 2010 the 2009 nips workshop on deep learning for speech recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large scale data sets that deep neural nets dnn might become practical it was believed that pre training dnns using generative models of deep belief nets dbn would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets however it was discovered that replacing pre training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using dnns with large context dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then state of the art gaussian mixture model gmm hidden markov model hmm and also than more advanced generative model based systems 91 64 93 the nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different 91 70 93 offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient run time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems 91 8 93 91 71 93 91 72 93 analysis around 2009 2010 contrasting the gmm and other generative speech models vs dnn models stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition 91 70 93 eventually leading to pervasive and dominant use in that industry that analysis was done with comparable performance less than 1 5 in error rate between discriminative dnns and generative models 91 64 93 91 70 93 91 73 93 in 2010 researchers extended deep learning from timit to large vocabulary speech recognition by adopting large output layers of the dnn based on context dependent hmm states constructed by decision trees 91 74 93 91 75 93 91 76 93 91 71 93 advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning in 2009 nvidia was involved in what was called the big bang of deep learning as deep learning neural networks were trained with nvidia graphics processing units gpus 91 77 93 that year andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deep learning systems by about 100 times 91 78 93 in particular gpus are well suited for the matrix vector computations involved in machine learning 91 79 93 91 80 93 91 81 93 gpus speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude reducing running times from weeks to days 91 82 93 91 83 93 further specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models 91 84 93 deep learning revolution edit how deep learning is a subset of machine learning and how machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence ai in 2012 a team led by george e dahl won the merck molecular activity challenge using multi task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug 91 85 93 91 86 93 in 2014 hochreiter s group used deep learning to detect off target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients household products and drugs and won the tox21 data challenge of nih fda and ncats 91 87 93 91 88 93 91 89 93 significant additional impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012 although cnns trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and gpu implementations of nns for years including cnns fast implementations of cnns on gpus were needed to progress on computer vision 91 79 93 91 81 93 91 36 93 91 90 93 91 12 93 in 2011 this approach achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest also in 2011 it won the icdar chinese handwriting contest and in may 2012 it won the isbi image segmentation contest 91 91 93 until 2011 cnns did not play a major role at computer vision conferences but in june 2012 a paper by ciresan et al at the leading conference cvpr 91 3 93 showed how max pooling cnns on gpu can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records in october 2012 a similar system by krizhevsky et al 91 4 93 won the large scale imagenet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods in november 2012 ciresan et al s system also won the icpr contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection and in the following year also the miccai grand challenge on the same topic 91 92 93 in 2013 and 2014 the error rate on the imagenet task using deep learning was further reduced following a similar trend in large scale speech recognition image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions captions for images often as a combination of cnns and lstms 91 93 93 91 94 93 91 95 93 some researchers state that the october 2012 imagenet victory anchored the start of a deep learning revolution that has transformed the ai industry 91 96 93 in march 2019 yoshua bengio geoffrey hinton and yann lecun were awarded the turing award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing neural networks edit artificial neural networks edit main article artificial neural network artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn progressively improve their ability to do tasks by considering examples generally without task specific programming for example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as cat or no cat and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images they have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule based programming an ann is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain each connection synapse between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron the receiving postsynaptic neuron can process the signal s and then signal downstream neurons connected to it neurons may have state generally represented by real numbers typically between 0 and 1 neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream typically neurons are organized in layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would over time attention focused on matching specific mental abilities leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis as of 2017 neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans e g recognizing faces or playing go 91 97 93 deep neural networks edit a deep neural network dnn is an artificial neural network ann with multiple layers between the input and output layers 91 9 93 91 12 93 there are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components neurons synapses weights biases and functions 91 98 93 these components as a whole function similarly to a human brain and can be trained like any other ml algorithm 91 citation needed 93 for example a dnn that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed the user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display above a certain threshold etc and return the proposed label each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer 91 citation needed 93 and complex dnn have many layers hence the name deep networks dnns can model complex non linear relationships dnn architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives 91 99 93 the extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network 91 9 93 for instance it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with dnns than with shallow networks 91 100 93 deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches each architecture has found success in specific domains it is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets dnns are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back at first the dnn creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values or weights to connections between them the weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1 if the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern an algorithm would adjust the weights 91 101 93 that way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data recurrent neural networks rnns in which data can flow in any direction are used for applications such as language modeling 91 102 93 91 103 93 91 104 93 91 105 93 91 106 93 long short term memory is particularly effective for this use 91 55 93 91 107 93 convolutional deep neural networks cnns are used in computer vision 91 108 93 cnns also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition asr 91 109 93 challenges edit as with anns many issues can arise with naively trained dnns two common issues are overfitting and computation time dnns are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data regularization methods such as ivakhnenko s unit pruning 91 27 93 or weight decay x2113 2 displaystyle ell 2 regularization or sparsity x2113 1 displaystyle ell 1 regularization can be applied during training to combat overfitting 91 110 93 alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training this helps to exclude rare dependencies 91 111 93 finally data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting 91 112 93 dnns must consider many training parameters such as the size number of layers and number of units per layer the learning rate and initial weights sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources various tricks such as batching computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples 91 113 93 speed up computation large processing capabilities of many core architectures such as gpus or the intel xeon phi have produced significant speedups in training because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations 91 114 93 91 115 93 alternatively engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms cmac cerebellar model articulation controller is one such kind of neural network it doesn t require learning rates or randomized initial weights for cmac the training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved 91 116 93 91 117 93 hardware edit since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non linear hidden units and a very large output layer 91 118 93 by 2019 graphic processing units gpus often with ai specific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large scale commercial cloud ai 91 119 93 openai estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet 2012 to alphazero 2017 and found a 300 000 fold increase in the amount of computation required with a doubling time trendline of 3 4 months 91 120 93 91 121 93 special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms deep learning processors include neural processing units npus in huawei cellphones 91 122 93 and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units tpu in the google cloud platform 91 123 93 cerebras systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models the cs 2 based on the largest processor in the industry the second generation wafer scale engine wse 2 91 124 93 91 125 93 atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage in 2020 marega et al published experiments with a large area active channel material for developing logic in memory devices and circuits based on floating gate field effect transistors fgfets 91 126 93 in 2021 j feldmann et al proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing 91 127 93 the authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts 1 massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs and 2 extremely high data modulation speeds 91 127 93 their system can execute trillions of multiply accumulate operations per second indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data heavy ai applications 91 127 93 applications edit automatic speech recognition edit main article speech recognition large scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning lstm rnns can learn very deep learning tasks 91 12 93 that involve multi second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms lstm with forget gates 91 107 93 is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks 91 56 93 the initial success in speech recognition was based on small scale recognition tasks based on timit the data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of american english where each speaker reads 10 sentences 91 128 93 its small size lets many configurations be tried more importantly the timit task concerns phone sequence recognition which unlike word sequence recognition allows weak phone bigram language models this lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily

180 93 a potentially impressive demonstration of unsupervised learning as prosecution of financial crime is required to produce training data also of note is that while the state of the art model in automated financial crime detection has existed for quite some time the applications for deep learning referred to here dramatically under perform much simpler theoretical models one such yet to be implemented model the sensor location heuristic and simple any human detection for financial crimes slhsahdfc is an example the model works with the simple heuristic of choosing where it gets its input data by placing the sensors by places frequented by large concentrations of wealth and power and then simply identifying any live human being it turns out that the automated detection of financial crime is accomplished at very high accuracies and very high confidence levels even better the model has shown to be extremely effective at identifying not just crime but large very destructive and egregious crime due to the effectiveness of such models it is highly likely that applications to financial crime detection by deep learning will never be able to compete military edit

insilico medicine spinoff company deep longevity relation to human cognitive and brain development edit deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development specifically neocortical development proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s 91 187 93 91 188 93 91 189 93 91 190 93 these developmental theories were instantiated in computational models making them predecessors of deep learning systems these developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain e g a wave of nerve growth factor support the self organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models like the neocortex neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer or the operating environment and then passes its output and possibly the original input to other layers this process yields a self organizing stack of transducers well tuned to their operating environment a 1995 description stated the infant s brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so called trophic factors different regions of the brain become connected sequentially with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature 91 191 93 a variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective on the one hand several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism 91 192 93 91 193 93 other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks may be closer to biological reality 91 194 93 91 195 93 in this respect generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling based processing in the cerebral cortex 91 196 93 although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established several analogies have been reported for example the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons 91 197 93 and neural populations 91 198 93 similarly the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system 91 199 93 both at the single unit 91 200 93 and at the population 91 201 93 levels commercial activity edit facebook s ai lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them 91 202 93 google s deepmind technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play atari video games using only pixels as data input in 2015 they demonstrated their alphago system which learned the game of go well enough to beat a professional go player 91 203 93 91 204 93 91 205 93 google translate uses a neural network to translate between more than 100 languages in 2017 covariant ai was launched which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories 91 206 93 as of 2008 91 207 93 researchers at the university of texas at austin ut developed a machine learning framework called training an agent manually via evaluative reinforcement or tamer which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor 91 181 93 first developed as tamer a new algorithm called deep tamer was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between u s army research laboratory arl and ut researchers deep tamer used deep learning to provide a robot the ability to learn new tasks through observation 91 181 93 using deep tamer a robot learned a task with a human trainer watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in person the robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer who provided feedback such as good job and bad job 91 208 93 criticism and comment edit deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment in some cases from outside the field of computer science theory edit see also explainable artificial intelligence a main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods 91 209 93 learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well understood gradient descent however the theory surrounding other algorithms such as contrastive divergence is less clear 91 citation needed 93 e g does it converge if so how fast what is it approximating deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box with most confirmations done empirically rather than theoretically 91 210 93 others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong ai not as an all encompassing solution despite the power of deep learning methods they still lack much of the functionality needed for realizing this goal entirely research psychologist gary marcus noted realistically deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge such as information about what objects are what they are for and how they are typically used the most powerful a i systems like watson use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques ranging from the statistical technique of bayesian inference to deductive reasoning 91 211 93 in further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep 20 30 layers neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained 91 212 93 demonstrate a visual appeal the original research notice received well over 1 000 comments and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on the guardian s 91 213 93 website errors edit some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors 91 214 93 such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images 2014 91 215 93 and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images 2013 91 216 93 goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi component artificial general intelligence agi architectures 91 214 93 these issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image grammar 91 217 93 decompositions of observed entities and events 91 214 93 learning a grammar visual or linguistic from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition 91 218 93 and artificial intelligence ai 91 219 93 cyber threat edit as deep learning moves from the lab into the world research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception 91 220 93 by identifying patterns that these systems use to function attackers can modify inputs to anns in such a way that the ann finds a match that human observers would not recognize for example an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ann finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target such manipulation is termed an adversarial attack 91 221 93 in 2016 researchers used one ann to doctor images in trial and error fashion identify another s focal points and thereby generate images that deceived it the modified images looked no different to human eyes another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system 91 222 93 one defense is reverse image search in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as tineye that can then find other instances of it a refinement is to search using only parts of the image to identify images from which that piece may have been taken 91 223 93 another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities potentially allowing one person to impersonate another in 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ann to misclassify them 91 222 93 anns can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry anns have been trained to defeat ann based anti malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti malware while retaining its ability to damage the target 91 222 93 in 2016 another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the google now voice command system open a particular web address and hypothesized that this could serve as a stepping stone for further attacks e g opening a web page hosting drive by malware 91 222 93 in data poisoning false data is continually smuggled into a machine

and when to remove this template message most deep learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and or annotated by humans it has been argued in media philosophy that not only low paid clickwork e g on amazon mechanical turk is regularly deployed for this purpose but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such 91 224 93 the philosopher rainer m hlhoff distinguishes five types of machinic capture of human microwork to generate training data 1 gamification the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game 2 trapping and tracking e g captchas for image recognition or click tracking on google search results pages 3 exploitation of social motivations e g tagging faces on facebook to obtain labeled facial images 4 information mining e g by leveraging quantified self devices such as activity trackers and 5 clickwork 91 224 93 m hlhoff argues that in most commercial end user applications of deep learning such as facebook s face recognition system the need for training data does not stop once an ann is trained rather there is a continued demand for human generated verification data 160 to constantly calibrate and update the ann for this purpose facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image they receive a notification they can choose whether of not they like to be publicly labeled on the image or tell facebook that it is not them in the picture 91 225 93 this user interface is a mechanism to generate a constant stream of verification data 91 224 93 to further train the network in real time as m hlhoff argues involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end user applications of deep learning that such systems may be referred to as human aided artificial intelligence 91 224 93 see also edit applications of artificial intelligence comparison of deep learning software compressed
