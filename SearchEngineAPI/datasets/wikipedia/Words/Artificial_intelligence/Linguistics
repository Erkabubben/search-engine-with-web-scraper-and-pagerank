linguistics lgbt linguistics origin of language orthography philosophy of linguistics prescriptivism second language acquisition theory of language portalvte linguistics is the scientific study of human language 91 1 93 91 2 93 it is called a scientific study because it entails a comprehensive systematic objective and precise analysis of all aspects of language 91 3 93 particularly its nature and structure 91 4 93 linguistics is concerned with both the cognitive and social aspects of language it is considered a scientific field as well as an academic discipline 91 5 93 it has been classified as a social science 91 6 93 natural science 91 7 93 cognitive science 91 8 93 or part of the humanities traditional areas of linguistic analysis correspond to phenomena found in human linguistic systems such as syntax rules governing the structure of sentences semantics meaning morphology structure of words phonetics speech sounds and equivalent gestures in sign languages phonology the abstract sound system of a particular language and pragmatics how social context contributes to meaning 91 9 93 subdisciplines such as biolinguistics the study of the biological variables and evolution of language and psycholinguistics the study of psychological factors in human language bridge many of these divisions 91 10 93 linguistics encompasses many branches and subfields that span both theoretical and practical applications 91 5 93 theoretical linguistics including traditional descriptive linguistics is concerned with understanding the fundamental nature of language and developing a general theoretical framework for describing it 91 11 93 applied linguistics seeks to utilise the scientific findings of the study of language for practical purposes such as developing methods of improving language education and literacy 91 12 93 linguistic phenomena may be studied through a variety of perspectives synchronically describing a language at a specific point of time or diachronically through historical development in monolinguals or multilinguals children or adults as they are learned or already acquired as abstract objects or cognitive structures through texts or oral elicitation and through mechanical data collection versus fieldwork 91 13 93 linguistics is related to philosophy of language stylistics and rhetorics semiotics lexicography and translation

subdisciplines edit historical linguistics edit main article historical linguistics historical linguistics is the study of how language changes in history particularly with regard to a specific language or a group of languages western trends in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late 18th century when the discipline grew out of philology the study of ancient texts and oral traditions 91 15 93 historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few sub disciplines in the field and was most widely practiced during the late 19th century 91 16 93 despite a shift in focus in the twentieth century towards formalism and generative grammar which studies the universal properties of language historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalisation 91 17 93 historical linguistics studies language change either diachronically through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present or in a synchronic manner by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current linguistic stage of a language 91 18 93 at first historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of comparative linguistics which involves a study of the relationship between different languages 91 19 93 during this time scholars of historical linguistics were only concerned with creating different categories of language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto languages by using both the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction internal reconstruction is the method by which an element that contains a certain meaning is re used in different contexts or environments where there is a variation in either sound or analogy 91 19 93 91 better 160 source 160 needed 93 the reason for this had been to describe well known indo european languages many of which used to have long written histories scholars of historical linguistics also studied uralic languages another european language family for which very little written material existed back then after this there was significant work that followed on the corpora of other languages too such as that of the austronesian languages as well as of native american language families the above approach of comparativism in linguistics is now however only a small part of the much broader discipline called historical linguistics the comparative study of specific indo european languages is considered a highly specialised field today while comparative research is carried out over the subsequent internal developments in a language in particular it is carried out over the development of modern standard varieties of languages or over the development of a language from its standardized form to its varieties 91 18 93 for instance some scholars also undertook a study attempting to establish super families linking for example indo european uralic and other language families to nostratic 91 20 93 while these attempts are still not widely accepted as credible methods they provide necessary information to establish relatedness in language change something that is not easily available as the depth of time increases the time depth of linguistic methods is generally limited due to the occurrence of chance word resemblances and variations between language groups but a limit of around 10 000 years is often assumed for the functional purpose of conducting research 91 21 93 difficulty also exists in the dating of various proto languages even though several methods are available only approximate results can be obtained in terms of arriving at dates for these languages 91 22 93 today with a subsequent re development of grammatical studies historical linguistics studies the change in language on a relational basis between dialect to dialect during one period as well as between those in the past and the present period and looks at evolution and shifts taking place morphologically syntactically as well as phonetically 91 23 93 syntax and morphology edit main articles syntax and morphology linguistics syntax and morphology are branches of linguistics concerned with the order and structure of meaningful linguistic units such as words and morphemes syntacticians study the rules and constraints that govern how speakers of a language can organize words into sentences morphologists study similar rules for the order of morphemes sub word units such as prefixes and suffixes and how they may be combined to form words 91 23 93 while words along with clitics are generally accepted as being the smallest units of syntax in most languages if not all many words can be related to other words by rules that collectively describe the grammar for that language for example english speakers recognize that the words dog and dogs are closely related differentiated only by the plurality morpheme s only found bound to noun phrases speakers of english recognize these relations from their innate knowledge of english s rules of word formation they infer intuitively that dog is to dogs as cat is to cats and in similar fashion dog is to dog catcher as dish is to dishwasher by contrast classical chinese has very little morphology using almost exclusively unbound morphemes free morphemes and depending on word order to convey meaning most words in modern standard chinese mandarin however are compounds and most roots are bound these are understood as grammars that represent the morphology of the language the rules understood by a speaker reflect specific patterns or regularities in the way words are formed from smaller units in the language they are using and how those smaller units interact in speech in this way morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word formation within and across languages and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages 91 24 93 phonological and orthographic modifications between a base word and its origin may be partial to literacy skills studies have indicated that the presence of modification in phonology and orthography makes morphologically complex words harder to understand and that the absence of modification between a base word and its origin makes morphologically complex words easier to understand morphologically complex words are easier to comprehend when they include a base word 91 25 93 polysynthetic languages such as chukchi have words composed of many morphemes the chukchi word t mey levtp t rk n for example meaning i have a fierce headache is composed of eight morphemes t mey levt p t rk n that may be glossed the morphology of such languages allows for each consonant and vowel to be understood as morphemes while the grammar of the language indicates the usage and understanding of each morpheme 91 26 93 the discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is morphophonology 91 27 93 semantics and pragmatics edit main articles formal semantics linguistics cognitive semantics and pragmatics semantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning these subfields have traditionally been divided according to aspects of meaning thought to arise from the grammar versus linguistic and social context semantics in this conception is concerned with grammatical and lexical meanings and pragmatics concerned with meaning in context the framework of formal semantics studies the denotations of sentences and the way they are composed from the meanings of their constituent expressions formal semantics draws heavily on philosophy of language and uses formal tools from logic and computer science cognitive semantics ties linguistic meaning to general aspects of cognition drawing on ideas from cognitive science such as prototype theory pragmatics encompasses phenomena such as speech acts implicature and talk in interaction 91 28 93 unlike semantics which examines meaning that is conventional or coded in a given language pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge grammar lexicon etc of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance 91 29 93 any pre existing knowledge about those involved the inferred intent of the speaker and other factors 91 30 93 in that respect pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity since meaning relies on the manner place time etc of an utterance 91 28 93 91 31 93 phonetics and phonology edit main articles phonetics and phonology phonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds or the equivalent aspects of sign languages phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their articulation acoustics production and perception phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds typology edit this paragraph is an excerpt from linguistic typology edit linguistic typology or language typology is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features to allow their comparison its aim is to describe and explain the structural diversity and the common properties of the world s languages 91 32 93 its subdisciplines include but are not limited to phonological typology which deals with sound features syntactic typology which deals with word order and form lexical typology which deals with language vocabulary and theoretical typology which aims to explain the universal tendencies 91 33 93 language varieties edit further information variety linguistics languages exist on a wide continuum of conventionalization with blurry divisions between concepts such as dialects and languages languages can undergo internal changes which lead to the development of subvarieties such as linguistic registers accents and dialects similarly languages can undergo changes caused by contact with speakers of other languages and new language varieties may be born from these contact situations through the process of language genesis contact varieties edit further information creolistics contact varieties such as pidgins and creoles are language varieties that often arise in situations of sustained contact between communities that speak different languages pidgins are language varieties with limited conventionalization where ideas are conveyed through simplified grammars that may grow more complex as linguistic contact continues creole languages are language varieties similar to pidgins but with greater conventionalization and stability as children grow up in contact situations they may learn a local pidgin as their native language through this process of acquisition and transmission new grammatical features and lexical items are created and introduced to fill gaps in the pidgin eventually developing into a complete language not all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop often these varieties arise in situations of colonization and enslavement where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other s language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained the subjugated language in the power relationship is the substrate language while the dominant language serves as the superstrate often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate making it the lexifier while grammatical structures come from the substrate but this is not always the case 91 34 93 dialect edit a dialect is a variety of language that is characteristic of a particular group among the language s speakers 91 35 93 the group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity this is what differentiates a dialect from a register or a discourse where in the latter case cultural identity does not always play a role dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules linguistic features and stylistic aspects but have not been given an official status as a language dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons other times dialects remain marginalized particularly when they are associated with marginalized social groups 91 36 93 91 page 160 needed 93 differentiation amongst dialects and subsequently languages is based upon the use of grammatical rules syntactic rules and stylistic features though not always on lexical use or vocabulary the popular saying that a language is a dialect with an army and navy is attributed as a definition formulated by max weinreich we may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect this should not make us think though that it is actually any better than any other dialect dialects are not good or bad nice or nasty right or wrong 160 they are just different from one another and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races religions and sexes 91 37 93 standard language edit this section does not cite any sources please help

documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community it gains political and national recognition through a country or region s policies that is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants after sufficient evolution improvisation correction and growth the english language besides perhaps the french language may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties relativity edit as constructed popularly through the sapir whorf hypothesis relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her world view universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person while the sapir whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of american linguists edward sapir and benjamin lee whorf it was sapir s student harry hoijer who termed it thus the 20th century german linguist leo weisgerber also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains the emergence of cognitive linguistics in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity thinkers like george lakoff have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors while the french philosopher of language jacques derrida s writings especially about deconstruction 91 38 93 have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics for which he was heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death 91 39 93 structures edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2019 learn how and when to remove this template message linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form any particular pairing of meaning and form is a saussurean linguistic sign for instance the meaning cat is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns in oral languages movements of the hands and face in sign languages and written symbols in written languages linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever increasing amount of available data linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know not always consciously all linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to sub conscious rules over multiple levels of analysis for instance consider the structure of the word tenth on two different levels of analysis on the level of internal word structure known as morphology the word tenth is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality the rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker th follows the number ten on the level of sound structure known as phonology structural analysis shows that the n sound in tenth is made differently from the n sound in ten spoken alone although most speakers of english are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of tenth they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these which govern how native speakers use language grammar edit grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language these rules apply to sound 91 40 93 as well as meaning and include componential subsets of rules such as those pertaining to phonology the organisation of phonetic sound systems morphology the formation and composition of words and syntax the formation and composition of phrases and sentences 91 41 93 modern frameworks that deal with the principles of grammar include structural and functional linguistics and generative linguistics 91 42 93 sub fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following phonetics the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties phonology the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker s mind that distinguish meaning phonemes morphology the study of morphemes or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified syntax the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences semantics the study of lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning 91 43 93 pragmatics the study of how utterances are used in communicative acts and the role played by situational context and non linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning 91 43 93 discourse analysis the analysis of language use in texts spoken written or signed stylistics the study of linguistic factors rhetoric diction stress that place a discourse in context semiotics the study of signs and sign processes semiosis indication designation likeness analogy metaphor symbolism signification and communication discourse edit discourse is language as social practice baynham 1995 and is a multilayered concept as a social practice discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies discourse influences genre which is chosen in response to different situations and finally at micro level discourse influences language as text spoken or written at the phonological or lexico grammatical level grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system 91 44 93 a particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose and is referred to as a register 91 45 93 there may be certain lexical additions new words that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of vocabulary and at times through the use of style too people in the medical fraternity for example may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine this is often referred to as being part of the medical discourse and so on lexicon edit the lexicon is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker s mind the lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes which are parts of words that can t stand alone like affixes in some analyses compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon dictionaries represent attempts at listing in alphabetical order the lexicon of a given language usually however bound morphemes are not included lexicography closely linked with the domain of semantics is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary the creation and addition of new words into the lexicon is called coining or neologization 91 46 93 and the new words are called neologisms it is often believed that a speaker s capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon however this is often considered a myth by linguists the capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar and to be linked with competence rather than with the growth of vocabulary even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences style edit stylistics also involves the study of written signed or spoken discourse through varying speech communities genres and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media 91 47 93 it involves the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular dialects and registers used by speech communities stylistic features include rhetoric 91 48 93 diction stress satire irony dialogue and other forms of phonetic variations stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature popular fiction news advertisements and other forms of communication in popular culture as well it is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community in short stylistics is the interpretation of text in the 1960s jacques derrida for instance further distinguished between speech and writing by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself 91 49 93 palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts as signs and symbols in language 91 50 93 the formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics which explores the representation and function of language in the mind neurolinguistics which studies language processing in the brain biolinguistics which studies the biology and evolution of language and language acquisition which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages approaches edit see also theory of language humanistic edit the fundamental principle of humanistic linguistics is that language is an invention created by people a semiotic tradition of linguistic research considers language a sign system which arises from the interaction of meaning and form 91 51 93 the organisation of linguistic levels is considered computational 91 52 93 linguistics is essentially seen as relating to social and cultural studies because different languages are shaped in social interaction by the speech community 91 53 93 frameworks representing the humanistic view of language include structural linguistics among others 91 54 93 structural analysis means dissecting each linguistic level phonetic morphological syntactic and discourse to the smallest units these are collected into inventories e g phoneme morpheme lexical classes phrase types to study their interconnectedness within a hierarchy of structures and layers 91 55 93 functional analysis adds to structural analysis the assignment of semantic and other functional roles that each unit may have for example a noun phrase may function as the subject or object of the sentence or the agent or patient 91 56 93 functional linguistics or functional grammar is a branch of structural linguistics in the humanistic reference the terms structuralism and functionalism are related to their meaning in other human sciences the difference between formal and functional structuralism lies in the way that the two approaches explain why languages have the properties they have functional explanation entails the idea that language is a tool for communication or that communication is the primary function of language linguistic forms are consequently explained by an appeal to their functional value or usefulness other structuralist approaches take the perspective that form follows from the inner mechanisms of the bilateral and multilayered language system 91 57 93 biological edit further information biolinguistics and biosemiotics approaches such as cognitive linguistics and generative grammar study linguistic cognition with a view towards uncovering the biological underpinnings of language in generative grammar these underpinning are understood as including innate domain specific grammatical knowledge thus one of the central concerns of the approach is to discover what aspects of linguistic knowledge are innate and which are not 91 58 93 91 59 93 cognitive linguistics in contrast rejects the notion of innate grammar and studies how the human mind creates linguistic constructions from event schemas 91 60 93 and the impact of cognitive constraints and biases on human language 91 61 93 in cognitive linguistics language is approached via the senses 91 62 93 91 63 93 a closely related approach is evolutionary linguistics 91 64 93 which includes the study of linguistic units as cultural replicators 91 65 93 91 66 93 it is possible to study how language replicates and adapts to the mind of the individual or the speech community 91 67 93 91 68 93 construction grammar is a framework which applies the meme concept to the study of syntax 91 69 93 91 70 93 91 71 93 91 72 93 the generative versus evolutionary approach are sometimes called formalism and functionalism respectively 91 73 93 this reference is however different from the use of the terms in human sciences 91 74 93 methodology edit linguistics is primarily descriptive 91 75 93 linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is good or bad this is analogous to practice in other sciences a zoologist studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is better or worse than another 91 76 93 prescription on the other hand is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others often favouring a particular dialect or acrolect this may have the aim of establishing a linguistic standard which can aid communication over large geographical areas it may also however be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects see linguistic imperialism an extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society prescription however may be practised appropriately in language instruction like in elt where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a second language speaker who is attempting to acquire the language 91 77 93 sources edit most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that spoken data and signed data are more fundamental than written data this is because speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it while there have been many cultures and speech communities that lack written communication features appear in speech which aren t always recorded in writing including phonological rules sound changes and speech errors all natural writing systems reflect a spoken language or potentially a signed one even with pictographic scripts like dongba writing naxi homophones with the same pictogram and text in writing systems used for two languages changing to fit the spoken language being recorded speech evolved before human beings invented writing individuals learn to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they do with writing nonetheless linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable for research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find and are typically transcribed and written in addition linguists have turned to text based discourse occurring in various formats of computer mediated communication as a viable site for linguistic inquiry the study of writing systems themselves graphemics is in any case considered a branch of linguistics analysis edit before the 20th century linguists analysed language on a diachronic plane which was historical in focus this meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later however with the rise of saussurean linguistics in the 20th century the focus shifted to a more synchronic approach where the study was geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations which existed at the same given point of time at another level the syntagmatic plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced within the syntax of a sentence for example the article the is followed by a noun because of the syntagmatic relation between the words the paradigmatic plane on the other hand focuses on an analysis that is based on the paradigms or concepts that are embedded in a given text in this case words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding history edit main article history of linguistics the earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the 6th century bc indian grammarian p ini 91 78 93 91 79 93 who wrote a formal description of the sanskrit language in his a dhy y 91 80 93 91 81 93 today modern day theories on grammar employ many of the principles that were laid down then 91 82 93 nomenclature edit before the 20th century the term philology first attested in 1716 91 83 93 was commonly used to refer to the study of language which was then predominantly historical in focus 91 84 93 91 85 93 since ferdinand de saussure s insistence on the importance of synchronic analysis however this focus has shifted 91 86 93 and the term philology is now generally used for the study of a language s grammar history and literary tradition especially in the united states 91 87 93 where philology has never been very popularly considered as the science of language 91 83 93 although the term linguist in the sense of a student of language dates from 1641 91 88 93 the term linguistics is first attested in 1847 91 88 93 it is now the usual term in english for the scientific study of language 91 citation needed 93 though linguistic science is sometimes used linguistics is a multi disciplinary field of research that combines tools from natural sciences social sciences formal sciences and the humanities 91 89 93 91 90 93 91 91 93 91 92 93 many linguists such as david crystal conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific 91 93 93 the term linguist applies to someone who studies language or is a researcher within the field or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages 91 94 93 early grammarians edit further information philology and grammarian greco roman the formal study of language began in india with p ini the 6th century bc grammarian who formulated 3 959 rules of sanskrit morphology p ini s systematic classification of the sounds of sanskrit into consonants and vowels and word classes such as nouns and verbs was the first known instance of its kind in the middle east sibawayh a persian made a detailed description of arabic in ad 760 in his monumental work al kitab fii an na w the book on grammar the first known author to distinguish between sounds and phonemes sounds as units of a linguistic system western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the east 91 95 93 but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the indic world early interest in language in the west was a part of philosophy not of grammatical description the first insights into semantic theory were made by plato in his cratylus dialogue where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas this work is the first to use the word etymology to describe the history of a word s meaning around 280 bc one of alexander the great s successors founded a university see musaeum in alexandria where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught greek to speakers of other languages while this school was the first to use the word grammar in its modern sense plato had used the word in its original meaning as t chn grammatik the art of writing which is also the title of one of the most important works of the alexandrine school by dionysius thrax 91 96 93 throughout the middle ages the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology the study of ancient languages and texts practised by such educators as roger ascham wolfgang ratke and john amos comenius 91 97 93 comparative philology edit in the 18th century the first use of the comparative method by william jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics 91 98 93 bloomfield attributes the first great scientific linguistic work of the world to jacob grimm who wrote deutsche grammatik 91 99 93 it was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of europe the study of language was broadened from indo european to language in general by wilhelm von humboldt of whom bloomfield asserts 91 99 93 this study received its foundation at the hands of the prussian statesman and scholar wilhelm von humboldt 1767 1835 especially in the first volume of his work on kavi the literary language of java entitled ber die verschiedenheit des menschlichen sprachbaues und ihren einflu auf die geistige entwickelung des menschengeschlechts on the variety of the structure of human language and its influence upon the mental development of the human race 20th century developments edit there was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early 20th century structural analysis was improved by leonard bloomfield louis hjelmslev and zellig harris who also developed methods of discourse analysis functional analysis was developed by the prague linguistic circle and andr martinet as sound recording devices became commonplace in the 1960s dialectal recordings were made and archived and the audio lingual method provided a technological solution to foreign language learning the 1960s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics the study of language universals in linguistic typology towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas

discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics and looks at how a language in general or a set of languages display variation and varieties at a given point in time the study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects registers and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style as well as through analysis of discourse sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society developmental linguistics edit main article developmental linguistics developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals particularly the acquisition of language in childhood some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into are how children acquire different languages how adults can acquire a second language and what the process of language acquisition is neurolinguistics edit main article neurolinguistics neurolinguistics is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories using aphasiology brain imaging electrophysiology and computer modelling amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language 91 100 93 applied linguistics edit main article applied linguistics linguists are largely concerned with finding and describing the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages applied linguistics takes the results of those findings and applies them to other areas linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as language education lexicography translation language planning which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use and natural language processing applied linguistics has been argued to be something of a misnomer 91 101 93 applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real world linguistic problems and not literally applying existing technical knowledge from linguistics moreover they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources such as sociology e g conversation analysis and anthropology constructed language fits under applied linguistics today computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers applications of computational linguistics in machine translation computer assisted translation and natural language processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints linguistic analysis is a sub discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim 91 102 93 this often takes the form of an interview by personnel in an immigration department depending on the country this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker s native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like english 91 102 93 australia uses the former method while germany employs the latter the netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved 91 102 93 tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government in this analysis linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker s nationality the reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government s decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker 91 102 93 language documentation edit language documentation combines anthropological inquiry into the history and culture of language with linguistic inquiry in order to describe languages and their grammars lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation as well as in language education the teaching of a second or foreign language policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research since the inception of the discipline of linguistics linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously undocumented languages starting with franz boas in the early 1900s this became the main focus of american linguistics until the rise of formal linguistics in the mid 20th century this focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples the ethnographic dimension of the boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics anthropological linguistics and linguistic anthropology which investigate the relations between language culture and society the emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside north america with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a focus in some university programmes in linguistics language description is a work intensive endeavour usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar further the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question consisting of texts and recordings both sound and video which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories and used for further research 91 103 93 translation edit main articles translation and translation studies the sub field of translation includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media from digital to print and spoken to translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other s language translators are also employed to work within computational linguistics setups like google translate which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages translation is also conducted by publishing houses which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology science law economics etc clinical linguistics edit main article clinical linguistics clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the field of speech language pathology speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to treat communication and swallowing disorders chaika 1990 showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders like rhyming inappropriately have attentional dysfunction as when a patient was shown a color chip and then asked to identify it responded looks like clay sounds like gray take you for a roll in the hay heyday may day the color chip was actually clay colored so his first response was correct however most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they ve said unless they are deliberately producing a pun poem or rap even then the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse people with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words 91 104 93 computational linguistics edit main article computational linguistics computational linguistics is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is computationally responsible i e taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations computational linguists also work on computer language and software development evolutionary linguistics edit main article evolutionary linguistics evolutionary linguistics is the study of the emergence of the language faculty through human evolution and also the application of evolutionary theory to the study of cultural evolution among different languages it is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe through movements among ancient communities 91 105 93 evolutionary linguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field including linguists biologists neuroscientists psychologists mathematicians and others by shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces the natural sciences it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of language are understood forensic
