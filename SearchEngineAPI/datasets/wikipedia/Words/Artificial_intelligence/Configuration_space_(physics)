configuration space physics from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search space defined by parameters that define a physical system s configuration c space redirects here for the art gallery see c space beijing for c displaystyle mathbb c space see complex analytic space in classical mechanics the parameters that define the configuration of a system are called generalized coordinates and the space defined by these coordinates is called the configuration space of the physical system it is often the case that these parameters satisfy mathematical constraints such that the set of actual configurations of the system is a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates this manifold is called the configuration manifold of the system notice that this is a notion of unrestricted configuration space i e in which different point particles may occupy the same position in mathematics in particular in topology a notion of restricted configuration space is mostly used in which the diagonals representing colliding particles are removed contents 1 example a particle in 3d space 2 example rigid body in 3d space 3 example robotic arm 4 formal definition 5 phase space 6 state space 7 see also 8 references 9 external links example a particle in 3d space edit the position of a single particle moving in ordinary euclidean 3 space is defined by the vector q x y z displaystyle q x y z and therefore its configuration space is q r 3 displaystyle q mathbb r 3 it is conventional to use the symbol q displaystyle q for a point in configuration space this is the convention in both the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics and in lagrangian mechanics the symbol p displaystyle p is used to denote momenta the symbol q x02d9 d q d t displaystyle dot q dq dt refers to velocities a particle might be constrained to move on a specific manifold for example if the particle is attached to a rigid linkage free to swing about the origin it is effectively constrained to lie on a sphere its configuration space is the subset of coordinates in r 3 displaystyle mathbb r 3 that define points on the sphere s 2 displaystyle s 2 in this case one says that the manifold q displaystyle q is the sphere i e q s 2 displaystyle q s 2 for n disconnected non interacting point particles the configuration space is r 3 n displaystyle mathbb r 3n in general however one is interested in the case where the particles interact for example they are specific locations in some assembly of gears pulleys rolling balls etc often constrained to move without slipping in this case the configuration space is not all of r 3 n displaystyle mathbb r 3n but the subspace submanifold of allowable positions that the points can take example rigid body in 3d space edit the set of coordinates that define the position of a reference point and the orientation of a coordinate frame attached to a rigid body in three dimensional space form its configuration space often denoted r 3 x00d7 s o 3 displaystyle mathbb r 3 times mathrm so 3 where r 3 displaystyle mathbb r 3 represents the coordinates of the origin of the frame attached to the body and s o 3 displaystyle mathrm so 3 represents the rotation matrices that define the orientation of this frame relative to a ground frame a configuration of the rigid body is defined by six parameters three from r 3 displaystyle mathbb r 3 and three from s o 3 displaystyle mathrm so 3 and is said to have six degrees of freedom in this case the configuration space q r 3 x00d7 s o 3 displaystyle q mathbb r 3 times mathrm so 3 is six dimensional and a point q x2208 q displaystyle q in q is just a point in that space the location of q displaystyle q in that configuration space is described using generalized coordinates thus three of the coordinates might describe the location of the center of mass of the rigid body while three more might be the euler angles describing its orientation there is no canonical choice of coordinates one could also choose some tip or endpoint of the rigid body instead of its center of mass one might choose to use quaternions instead of euler angles and so on however the parameterization does not change the mechanical characteristics of the system all of the different parameterizations ultimately describe the same six dimensional manifold the same set of possible positions and orientations some parameterizations are easier to work with than others and many important statements can be made by working in a coordinate free fashion examples of coordinate free statements are that the tangent space t q displaystyle tq corresponds to the velocities of the points q x2208 q displaystyle q in q while the cotangent space t x2217 q displaystyle t q corresponds to momenta velocities and momenta can be connected for the most general abstract case this is done with the rather abstract notion of the tautological one form example robotic arm edit see also configuration space mathematics 160 configuration spaces of mechanical linkages for a robotic arm consisting of numerous rigid linkages the configuration space consists of the location of each linkage taken to be a rigid body as in the section above subject to the constraints of how the linkages are attached to each other and their allowed range of motion thus for n displaystyle n linkages one might consider the total space r 3 x00d7 s o 3 n displaystyle left mathbb r 3 times mathrm so 3 right n except that all of the various attachments and constraints mean that not every point in this space is reachable thus the configuration space q displaystyle q is necessarily a subspace of the n displaystyle n rigid body configuration space note however that in robotics the term configuration space can also refer to a further reduced subset the set of reachable positions by a robot s end effector 91 1 93 this definition however leads to complexities described by the holonomy that is there may be several different ways of arranging a robot arm to obtain a particular end effector location and it is even possible to have the robot arm move while keeping the end effector stationary thus a complete description of the arm suitable for use in kinematics requires the specification of all of the joint positions and angles and not just some of them the joint parameters of the robot are used as generalized coordinates to define configurations the set of joint parameter values is called the joint space a robot s forward and inverse kinematics equations define maps between configurations and end effector positions or between joint space and configuration space robot motion planning uses this mapping to find a path in joint space that provides an achievable route in the configuration space of the end effector formal definition edit in classical mechanics the configuration of a system consists of the positions had by all components subject to kinematical constraints 91 2 93 phase space edit the configuration space is insufficient to completely describe a mechanical system it fails to take into account velocities the set of velocities available to a system defines a plane tangent to the configuration manifold of the system at a point q x2208 q displaystyle q in q that tangent plane is denoted by t q q displaystyle t q q momentum vectors are linear functionals of the tangent plane known as cotangent vectors for a point q x2208 q displaystyle q in q that cotangent plane is denoted by t q x2217 q displaystyle t q q the set of positions and momenta of a mechanical system forms the cotangent bundle t x2217 q displaystyle t q of the configuration manifold q displaystyle q this larger manifold is called the phase space of the system state space edit in quantum mechanics the analogous concept is called the state space a rather different set of formalisms and notation are used in this case the analog of a point particle becomes a single point in c p 1 displaystyle mathbb cp 1 the complex projective line also known as the bloch sphere it is complex because a quantum mechanical wave function has a complex phase it is projective because the wave function is normalized to unit probability that is given a wave function x03c8 displaystyle psi one is free to normalize it by the total probability x222b x03c8 x2217 x03c8 textstyle int psi psi thus making it projective see
