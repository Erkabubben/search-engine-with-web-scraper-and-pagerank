kismet robot from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search this article is about a robot called kismet for other uses of kismet see kismet kismet now resides at the mit museum in cambridge massachusetts united states kismet is a robot head made in the 1990s at massachusetts institute of technology by dr cynthia breazeal as an experiment in affective computing a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions the name kismet comes from a turkish word meaning fate or sometimes luck 91 1 93 hardware design and construction edit in order for kismet to properly interact with human beings it contains input devices that give it auditory visual and proprioception abilities kismet simulates emotion through various facial expressions vocalizations and movement facial expressions are created through movements of the ears eyebrows eyelids lips jaw and head the cost of physical materials was an estimated us 25 000 91 1 93 in addition to the equipment mentioned above there are four motorola 68332s nine 400 160 mhz pcs and another 500 160 mhz pc 91 1 93 software system edit kismet s social intelligence software system or synthetic nervous system sns was designed with human models of intelligent behavior in mind it contains six subsystems 91 2 93 as follows low level feature extraction system edit this system processes raw visual and auditory information from cameras and microphones kismet s vision system can perform eye detection motion detection and albeit controversial skin color detection whenever kismet moves its head it momentarily disables its motion detection system to avoid detecting self motion it also uses its stereo cameras to estimate the distance of an object in its visual field for example to detect threats large close objects with a lot of movement 91 3 93 kismet s audio system is mainly tuned towards identifying affect in infant directed speech in particular it can detect five different types of affective speech approval prohibition attention comfort and neutral the affective intent classifier was created as follows low level features such as pitch mean and energy volume variance were extracted from samples of recorded speech the classes of affective intent were then modeled as a gaussian mixture model and trained with these samples using the expectation maximization algorithm classification is done with multiple stages first classifying an utterance into one of two general groups e g soothing neutral vs prohibition attention approval and then doing more detailed classification this architecture significantly improved performance for hard to distinguish classes like approval you re a clever robot versus attention hey kismet over here 91 3 93 motivation system edit dr breazeal figures her relations with the robot as something like an infant caretaker interaction where i m the caretaker essentially and the robot is like an infant the overview sets the human robot relation within a frame of learning with dr breazeal providing the scaffolding for kismet s development it offers a demonstration of kismet s capabilities narrated as emotive facial expressions that communicate the robot s motivational state dr brazeal this one is anger laugh extreme anger disgust excitement fear this is happiness this one is interest this one is sadness surprise this one is tired and this one is sleep 91 4 93 at any given moment kismet can only be in one emotional state at a time however breazeal states that kismet is not conscious so it does not have feelings 91 5 93 motor system edit kismet speaks a proto language with a variety of phonemes similar to baby s babbling it uses the dectalk voice synthesizer and changes pitch timing articulation etc to express various emotions intonation is used to vary between question and statement like utterances lip synchronization was important for realism and the developers used a strategy from animation 91 6 93 simplicity is the secret to successful lip animation thus they did not try to imitate lip motions perfectly but instead create a visual short hand that passes unchallenged by the viewer see also edit affective computing artificial intelligence references edit a b c peter menzel and faith d aluisio robosapiens cambridge the mit press 2000 pg 66 breazeal cynthia designing sociable robots the mit press 2002 a b kismet the robot suchman lucy subject objects feminist theory 2011 pg 127 breazeal cynthia designing sociable robots the mit press 2002 pg 112 madsen r animated film concepts methods uses interland new york 1969 external links edit wikimedia commons has media related to kismet robot official website description de kismet in french retrieved from https en wikipedia org w index php title kismet robot amp oldid 1110894640 categories humanoid robotsprototype robotssocial robotsrobots of the united statesmassachusetts institute of technology1990s robotsrobot headshidden categories commons category link from wikidataarticles with french language sources fr
