theory vte transdisciplinary field concerned with regulatory and purposive systems for organisms with both organic and mechanical parts see cyborg for other uses see cybernetics disambiguation cybernetics is a wide ranging field concerned with circular causal processes such as feedback norbert wiener named the field after an example of circular causal feedback that of steering a ship 91 note 1 93 where the steersperson adjusts their steering in response to the effect it is observed as having enabling a steady course to maintained amongst disturbances such as cross winds or the tide 91 1 93 cybernetics is concerned with circular causal processes however they are embodied 91 2 93 including in ecological technological biological cognitive and social systems and also in the context of practical activities such as designing learning managing its transdisciplinary 91 3 93 character has meant that cybernetics intersects with a number of other fields leading to it having both wide

references 14 external links definitions edit cybernetics has been defined in a variety of ways reflecting the richness of its conceptual base 91 4 93 one of the most well known definitions is that of norbert wiener who characterised cybernetics as concerned with control and communication in the animal and the machine 91 5 93 another early definition is that of the macy cybernetics conferences where cybernetics was understood as the study of circular causal and feedback mechanisms in biological and social systems 91 6 93 margaret mead emphasised the role of cybernetics as a form of cross disciplinary thought which made it possible for members of many disciplines to communicate with each other easily in a language which all could understand 91 7 93 other definitions include 91 8 93 the art of governing or the science of government andr marie amp re the art of steersmanship ross ashby the study of systems of any nature which are capable of receiving storing and processing information so as to use it for control andrey kolmogorov a branch of mathematics dealing with problems of control recursiveness and information focuses on forms and the patterns that connect gregory bateson the art of securing efficient operation louis couffignal 91 9 93 91 10 93 the art of effective organization stafford beer the science or the art of manipulating defensible metaphors showing how they may be constructed and what can be inferred as a result of their existence gordon pask 91 11 93 the art of creating equilibrium in a world of constraints and possibilities ernst von glasersfeld the science and art of understanding humberto maturana the ability to cure all temporary truth of eternal triteness herbert brun a way of thinking about ways of thinking of which it is one larry richards 91 12 93 etymology edit simple feedback model ab lt 0 for negative feedback according to norbert wiener the word cybernetics was coined by a research group involving himself and arturo rosenblueth in the summer of 1947 91 5 93 it has been attested in print since at least 1948 through wiener s book cybernetics or control and communication in the animal and the machine 91 note 2 93 in the book wiener states after much consideration we have come to the conclusion that all the existing terminology has too heavy a bias to one side or another to serve the future development of the field as well as it should and as happens so often to scientists we have been forced to coin at least one artificial neo greek expression to fill the gap we have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory whether in the machine or in the animal by the name cybernetics which we form from the greek or steersman moreover wiener explains the term was chosen to recognize james clerk maxwell s 1868 publication on feedback mechanisms involving governors noting that the term governor is also derived from kubern t s via a latin corruption gubernator finally wiener motivates the choice by steering engines of a ship being one of the earliest and best developed forms of feedback mechanisms 91 5 93 independently the french term cybern tique was used in 1834 by andr marie amp re in essai sur la philosophie des sciences to describe the science of civil government 91 14 93 feedback edit main article feedback feedback is a process where the observed outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action in ways that support the pursuit and maintenance of particular conditions or their disruption forming a circular causal relationship in steering a ship where the helmsperson maintains a steady course in a changing environment by adjusting their steering in continual response to the effect it is observed as having 91 15 93 other examples of circular causal feedback include technological devices such as thermostats where the action of a heater responds to measured changes in temperature regulating the temperature of the room within a set range biological examples such as the coordination of volitional movement through the nervous system and processes of social interaction such as conversation 91 16 93 history edit this section may contain an excessive

greek term kubern tik s good at steering appears in plato s republic 91 17 93 and alcibiades where the metaphor of a steersman is used to signify the governance of people 91 18 93 the french word cybern tique was also used in 1834 by the physicist andr marie amp re to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge the first artificial automatic regulatory system was a water clock invented by the mechanician ktesibios based on a tank which poured water into a reservoir before using it to run the mechanism it used a cone shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir this was the first artificial truly automatic self regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism devices constructed by ktesibios and others such as hero of alexandria philo of byzantium and su song are early examples of cybernetic principles in action james watt in the late 18th century james watt s steam engine was equipped with a governor a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine in 1868 james clerk maxwell published a theoretical article on governors one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self regulating devices jakob von uexk ll applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle funktionskreis in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of bell telephone laboratories engineer harold s black on using negative feedback to control amplifiers in 1935 russian physiologist p k anokhin published a book in which the concept of feedback back afferentation was studied other precursors include alexander bogdanov s tektology scottish philosopher kenneth craik and romanian physician tefan odobleja first wave edit see also macy conferences and ratio club norbert wiener the initial focus of cybernetics was on parallels between regulatory feedback processes in biological and technological systems two foundational articles were published in 1943 behavior purpose and teleology by arturo rosenblueth norbert wiener and julian bigelow based on the research on living organisms that rosenblueth did in mexico and the paper a logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity by warren mcculloch and walter pitts in the early 1940s john von neumann contributed a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics von neumann cellular automata and their logical follow up the von neumann universal constructor leading to the concept of self replication which cybernetics adopted as a core concept the foundations of cybernetics were then developed through a series of transdisciplinary conferences funded by the josiah macy jr foundation between 1946 and 1953 the conferences were chaired by mcculloch and had participants included ross ashby gregory bateson heinz von foerster margaret mead john von neumann and norbert wiener in the uk similar focuses were explored by the ratio club an informal dining club of young psychiatrists psychologists physiologists mathematicians and engineers that met between 1949 and 1958 in the spring of 1947 wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis held in nancy organized by the bourbaki and mathematician szolem mandelbrojt during this stay in france wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics the following summer back in the united states wiener decided to introduce the neologism cybernetics coined to denote the study of teleological mechanisms into his scientific theory it was popularized through his book cybernetics or control and communication in the animal and the machine 91 5 93 during the 1950s cybernetics was developed as a primarily technical discipline for instance in 1954 qian xuesen published work engineering cybernetics was the basis of science in segregating the engineering concepts of cybernetics from the theoretical understanding of cybernetics as described so far historically in the soviet union cybernetics was initially considered with suspicion 91 19 93 however in the mid to late 1950s viktor glushkov and others salvaged the reputation of the field incorporating much of what became known as computer science in the west 91 20 93 by the 1960s and 1970s however cybernetics transdisciplinarity fragmented with technical focuses separating into separate fields artificial intelligence ai was founded as a distinct discipline at the dartmouth workshop in 1956 differentiating itself the broader cybernetics field after some uneasy coexistence ai gained funding and prominence consequently cybernetic sciences such as the study of artificial neural networks were downplayed 91 21 93 similarly computer science became defined as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s 91 22 93 second wave edit see also second order cybernetics the second wave of cybernetics came to prominence from the 1960s onwards with its focus inflecting away from technology towards social ecological and philosophical concerns it was still grounded in biology notably maturana and varela s autopoiesis and built on earlier work on self organising systems and the presence of anthropologists mead and bateson in the macy meetings the biological computer laboratory founded in 1958 and active until the mid 1970s under the direction of heinz von foerster at the university of illinois at urbana champaign was a major incubator of this inflection in cybernetics research programme 91 23 93 focuses of the second wave of cybernetics included management cybernetics such as stafford beer s biologically inspired viable system model work in family therapy drawing on bateson social systems such as in the work of niklas luhmann epistemology and pedagogy such as in the development of radical constructivism 91 24 93 cybernetics core theme of circular causality was developed beyond goal oriented processes to concerns with reflexivity and recursion this was especially so in the development of second order cybernetics or the cybernetics of cybernetics developed and promoted by heinz von foerster which focused on questions of observation cognition epistemology and ethics the 1960s onwards also saw cybernetics begin to develop exchanges with the creative arts design and architecture notably with the cybernetic serendipity exhibition ica london 1968 curated by jasia reichardt 91 25 93 91 26 93 and the unrealised fun palace project london unrealised 1964 onwards where gordon pask was consultant to architect cedric price and theatre director joan littlewood 91 27 93 third wave edit from the 1990s onwards there has been a renewed interest in cybernetics from a number of directions early cybernetic work on artificial neural networks has been returned to as a paradigm in machine learning and artificial intelligence the entanglements of society with emerging technologies has led to exchanges with feminist technoscience and posthumanism re examinations of cybernetics history have seen science studies scholars emphasising cybernetics unusual qualities as a science such as its performative ontology 91 28 93 practical design disciplines have drawn on cybernetics for theoretical underpinning and transdisciplinary connections 91 29 93 emerging topics include how cybernetics

more parties in ongoing relationships where there is a contradiction between messages at different logical levels that creates a situation with emotional threat but no possibility of withdrawal from the situation and no way to articulate the problem 91 32 93 while the theory was first described by gregory bateson and colleagues in the 1950s with regard to the origins of schizophrenia 91 33 93 it is also characteristic of many other social contexts 91 32 93 ecological aesthetics edit main article gregory bateson 160 ecological anthropology and cybernetics gregory bateson saw the world as a series of systems containing those of individuals societies and ecosystems each of these systems has adaptive changes which depend upon feedback loops to control balance by changing multiple variables he saw the natural ecological system as innately good as long as it was allowed to maintain homeostasis and that the key unit of survival in evolution was an organism and its environment 91 34 93 bateson in this subject presents western epistemology as a method of thinking that leads to a mindset in which man exerts an autocratic rule over all cybernetic systems and in doing so he unbalances the natural cybernetic system of controlled competition and mutual dependency bateson claims that humanity will never be able to control the whole system because it does not operate in a linear fashion and if humanity creates his own rules for the system he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self made system due to the non linear nature of cybernetics lastly man s technological prowess combined with his scientific hubris gives him the potential to irrevocably damage and destroy the supreme cybernetic system i e the biosphere instead of just disrupting the system temporally until the system can self correct 91 34 93 second order cybernetics edit main article second order cybernetics second order cybernetics also known as the cybernetics of cybernetics is the recursive application of cybernetics to itself and the practice of cybernetics according to such a critique it is cybernetics where the role of the observer is appreciated and acknowledged rather than disguised as had become traditional in western science 91 35 93 it has seen development of cybernetics in relation to family therapy the social sciences the creative arts design research and philosophy it is associated with margaret mead heinz von foerster the biological computer laboratory and the american society for cybernetics second order cybernetics overlaps with radical constructivism 91 36 93 an approach to epistemology developed initially by ernst von glasersfeld a central concern in second order cybernetics is self reference an example of a self referential system explored in second order cybernetics is that of an eigenform which plays an important role in the work of heinz von foerster 91 37 93 and is inextricably linked with second order cybernetics 91 38 93 the critique of objectivity developed in second order cybernetics led to a concern with ethical issues foerster developed a critique of morality in ethical terms arguing for ethics to remain implicit in action 91 39 93 foerster s position has been described as an ethics of enabling ethics 91 40 93 or as a form of recursive ethical questioning 91 41 93 varela published a short book on ethical know how 91 42 93

model of behavior based on the properties of negative feedback cybernetic control loops a key insight of pct is that the controlled variable is not the output of the system the behavioral actions but its input that is a sensed and transformed function of some state of the environment that the control system s output can affect because these sensed and transformed inputs may appear as consciously perceived aspects of the environment powers labelled the controlled variable perception the theory came to be known as perceptual control theory to distinguish from those control theorists that assert or assume that it is the system s output that is controlled psychotherapy edit main articles family therapy systemic therapy psychotherapy and systems psychology the development of family therapy was
