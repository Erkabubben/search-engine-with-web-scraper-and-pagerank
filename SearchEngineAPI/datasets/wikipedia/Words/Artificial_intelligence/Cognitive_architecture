cognitive architecture from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search a cognitive architecture refers to both a theory about the structure of the human mind and to a computational instantiation of such a theory used in the fields of artificial intelligence ai and computational cognitive science 91 1 93 the formalized models can be used to further refine a comprehensive theory of cognition and as a useful artificial intelligence program successful cognitive architectures include act r adaptive control of thought rational and soar the research on cognitive architectures as software instantiation of cognitive theories was initiated by allen newell in 1990 91 2 93 the institute for creative technologies defines cognitive architecture as hypothesis about the fixed structures that provide a mind whether in natural or artificial systems and how they work together in conjunction with knowledge and skills embodied within the architecture to yield intelligent behavior in a diversity of complex environments 91 3 93 contents 1 history 2 distinctions 3 notable examples 4 see also 5 references 6 external links history edit herbert a simon one of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence stated that the 1960 thesis by his student ed feigenbaum epam provided a possible architecture for cognition 91 4 93 because it included some commitments for how more than one fundamental aspect of the human mind worked in epam s case human memory and human learning john r anderson started research on human memory in the early 1970s and his 1973 thesis with gordon h bower provided a theory of human associative memory 91 5 93 he included more aspects of his research on long term memory and thinking processes into this research and eventually designed a cognitive architecture he eventually called act he and his students were influenced by allen newell s use of the term cognitive architecture anderson s lab used the term to refer to the act theory as embodied in a collection of papers and designs there was not a complete implementation of act at the time in 1983 john r anderson published the seminal work in this area entitled the architecture of cognition 91 6 93 one can distinguish between the theory of cognition and the implementation of the theory the theory of cognition outlined the structure of the various parts of the mind and made commitments to the use of rules associative networks and other aspects the cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers the software used to implement the cognitive architectures were also cognitive architectures thus a cognitive architecture can also refer to a blueprint for intelligent agents it proposes artificial computational processes that act like certain cognitive systems most often like a person or acts intelligent under some definition cognitive architectures form a subset of general agent architectures the term architecture implies an approach that attempts to model not only behavior but also structural properties of the modelled system distinctions edit cognitive architectures can be symbolic connectionist or hybrid 91 7 93 some cognitive architectures or models are based on a set of generic rules as e g the information processing language e g soar based on the unified theory of cognition or similarly act r many of these architectures are based on the mind is like a computer analogy in contrast subsymbolic processing specifies no such rules a priori and relies on emergent properties of processing units e g nodes hybrid architectures combine both types of processing such as clarion a further distinction is whether the architecture is centralized with a neural correlate of a processor at its core or decentralized distributed the decentralized flavor has become popular under the name of parallel distributed processing in mid 1980s and connectionism a prime example being neural networks a further design issue is additionally a decision between holistic and atomistic or more concrete modular structure in traditional ai intelligence is often programmed from above the programmer is the creator and makes something and imbues it with its intelligence though many traditional ai systems were also designed to learn e g improving their game playing or problem solving competence biologically inspired computing on the other hand takes sometimes a more bottom up decentralised approach bio inspired techniques often involve the method of specifying a set of simple generic rules or a set of simple nodes from the interaction of which emerges the overall behavior it is hoped to build up complexity until the end result is something markedly complex see complex systems however it is also arguable that systems designed top down on the basis of observations of what humans and other animals can do rather than on observations of brain mechanisms are also biologically inspired though in a different way notable examples edit a comprehensive review of implemented cognitive architectures has been undertaken in 2010 by samsonovich et al 91 8 93 and is available as an online repository 91 9 93 some

the cerebellar model articulation controller cmac is a type of neural network based on a model of the mammalian cerebellum it is a type of associative memory 91 13 93 the cmac was first proposed as a function modeler for robotic controllers by james albus in 1975 and has been extensively used in reinforcement learning and also as for automated classification in the machine learning community

the new bulgarian university under boicho kokinov forr developed by susan l epstein at the city university of new york framsticks a connectionist distributed neural architecture for simulated creatures or robots where modules of neural networks composed of heterogenous neurons including receptors and effectors can be designed and evolved google deepmind the company has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a similar fashion to humans 91 14 93 and a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional turing machine 91 15 93 resulting in a computer that appears to possibly mimic the short term memory of the human brain the underlying algorithm is based on a combination of q learning with multilayer recurrent neural network 91 16 93 also see an overview by j rgen schmidhuber on earlier related work in deep learning 91 17 93 91 18 93 holographic associative memory this architecture is part of the family of
