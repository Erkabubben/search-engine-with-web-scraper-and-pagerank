includes both formal and informal logic formal logic is the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths it is a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic neutral way when used as a countable noun the term a logic refers to a logical formal system that articulates a proof system formal logic contrasts with informal logic which is associated with informal fallacies critical thinking and argumentation theory while there is no general agreement on how formal and informal logic are to be distinguished one prominent approach associates their difference with whether the studied arguments are expressed in formal or informal languages logic plays a central role in multiple fields such as philosophy mathematics computer science and linguistics logic studies arguments which consist of a set of premises together with a conclusion premises and conclusions are usually understood either as sentences or as propositions and are characterized by their internal structure complex propositions are made up of simpler propositions linked to each other by propositional connectives like x2227 displaystyle land and or x2192 displaystyle to if then the truth of a proposition usually depends on the denotations of its constituents logically true propositions constitute a special case since their truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in them and not on the denotations of other terms arguments can be either correct or incorrect an argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion the strongest form of support is found in deductive arguments it is impossible for their premises to be true and their conclusion to be false deductive arguments contrast with ampliative arguments which may arrive in their conclusion at new information that is not present in the premises however it is possible for all their premises to be true while their conclusion is still false many arguments found in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments sometimes divided into inductive and abductive arguments inductive arguments usually take the form of statistical generalizations while abductive arguments are inferences to the best explanation arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning are called fallacies systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of reasoning and arguments logic has been studied since antiquity early approaches include aristotelian logic stoic logic anviksiki and the mohists modern formal logic has its roots in the work of late 19th century mathematicians such as gottlob frege while aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of syllogisms in the modern era its traditional dominance was replaced by classical logic a set of fundamental logical intuitions shared by most logicians it consists of propositional logic which only considers the logical relations on the level of propositions and first order logic which also articulates the internal structure of propositions using various linguistic devices such as predicates and quantifiers extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind classical logic and extend it to other fields such as metaphysics ethics and epistemology deviant logics on the other hand reject certain classical intuitions and provide alternative accounts of the

variety of translations such as reason discourse or language 91 1 93 91 2 93 logic is traditionally defined as the study of the laws of thought or correct reasoning 91 3 93 and is usually understood in terms of inferences or arguments reasoning may be seen as the activity of drawing inferences whose outward expression is given in arguments 91 3 93 91 4 93 an inference or an argument is a set of premises together with a conclusion logic is interested in whether arguments are good or inferences are valid i e whether the premises support their conclusions 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 these general characterizations apply to logic in the widest sense since they are true both for formal and informal logic 91 8 93 but many definitions of logic focus on the more paradigmatic formal logic in this narrower sense logic is a formal science that studies how conclusions follow from premises in a topic neutral way 91 9 93 91 10 93 in this regard logic is sometimes contrasted with the theory of rationality which is wider since it covers all forms of good reasoning 91 11 93 alfred tarski was an important defender of the idea that logical truth can be defined in terms of possible interpretations 91 12 93 91 13 93 as a formal science logic contrasts with both the natural and social sciences in that it tries to characterize the inferential relations between premises and conclusions based on their structure alone 91 14 93 this means that the actual content of these propositions i e their specific topic is not important for whether the inference is valid or not 91 9 93 91 10 93 valid inferences are characterized by the fact that the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false 91 7 93 91 15 93 the general logical structures characterizing valid inferences are called rules of inference 91 5 93 in this sense logic is often defined as the study of valid inference 91 4 93 this contrasts with another prominent characterization of logic as the science of logical truths 91 16 93 a proposition is logically true if its truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in it this means that it is true in all possible worlds and under all interpretations of its non logical terms 91 17 93 these two characterizations of logic are closely related to each other an inference is valid if the material conditional from its premises to its conclusion is logically true 91 16 93 the term logic can also be used in a slightly different sense as a countable noun in this sense a logic is a logical formal system different logics differ from each other concerning the formal languages used to express them and most importantly concerning the rules of inference they accept as valid 91 4 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 starting in the 20th century many new formal systems have been proposed there are various disagreements concerning what makes a formal system a logic 91 4 93 91 19 93 for example it has been suggested that only logically complete systems qualify as logics for such reasons some theorists deny that higher order logics and fuzzy logic are logics in the strict sense 91 4 93 91 20 93 formal and informal logic edit logic encompasses both formal and informal logic 91 4 93 formal logic is the traditionally dominant field 91 15 93 but applying its insights to actual everyday arguments has prompted modern developments of informal logic 91 21 93 91 22 93 91 23 93 which considers problems that formal logic on its own is unable to address 91 15 93 91 23 93 both provide criteria for assessing the correctness of arguments and distinguishing them from fallacies 91 8 93 91 15 93 various suggestions have been made concerning how to draw the distinction between the two but there is no universally accepted answer 91 23 93 91 24 93 formal logic needs to translate natural language arguments into a formal language like first order logic in order to assess whether they are valid in this example the colors indicate how the english words correspond to the symbols the most literal approach sees the terms formal and informal as applying to the language used to express arguments 91 21 93 91 22 93 91 25 93 on this view formal logic studies arguments expressed in formal languages while informal logic studies arguments expressed in informal or natural languages 91 15 93 this means that the inference from the formulas p displaystyle p and q displaystyle q to the conclusion p x2227 q displaystyle p land q is studied by formal logic the inference from the english sentences al lit a cigarette and bill stormed out of the room to the sentence al lit a cigarette and bill stormed out of the room on the other hand belongs to informal logic formal languages are characterized by their precision and simplicity 91 25 93 they normally contain a very limited vocabulary and exact rules on how their symbols can be used to construct sentences usually referred to as well formed formulas 91 26 93 this simplicity and exactness of formal logic make it capable of formulating precise rules of inference that determine whether a given argument is valid 91 26 93 this approach brings with it the need to translate natural language arguments into the formal language before their validity can be assessed a procedure that comes with various problems of its own 91 27 93 91 14 93 91 23 93 informal logic avoids some of these problems by analyzing natural language arguments in their original form without the need of translation 91 8 93 91 21 93 but it faces problems associated with the ambiguity vagueness and context dependence of natural language expressions 91 15 93 91 28 93 91 29 93 a closely related approach applies the terms formal and informal not just to the language used but more generally to the standards criteria and procedures of argumentation 91 30 93 another approach draws the distinction according to the different types of inferences analyzed 91 21 93 91 31 93 this perspective understands formal logic as the study of deductive inferences in contrast to informal logic as the study of non deductive inferences like inductive or abductive inferences 91 21 93 the characteristic of deductive inferences is that the truth of their premises ensures the truth of their conclusion this means that if all the premises are true it is impossible for the conclusion to be false 91 7 93 91 15 93 for this reason deductive inferences are in a sense trivial or uninteresting since they do not provide the thinker with any new information not already found in the premises 91 32 93 91 33 93 non deductive inferences on the other hand are ampliative they help the thinker learn something above and beyond what is already stated in the premises they achieve this at the cost of certainty even if all premises are true the conclusion of an ampliative argument may still be false 91 16 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 one more approach tries to link the difference between formal and informal logic to the distinction between formal and informal fallacies 91 21 93 91 23 93 91 30 93 this distinction is often drawn in relation to the form content and context of arguments in the case of formal fallacies the error is found on the level of the argument s form whereas for informal fallacies the content and context of the argument are responsible 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 formal logic abstracts away from the argument s content and is only interested in its form specifically whether it follows a valid rule of inference 91 9 93 91 10 93 in this regard it is not important for the validity of a formal argument whether its premises are true or false informal logic on the other hand also takes the content and context of an argument into consideration 91 15 93 91 23 93 91 25 93 a false dilemma for example involves an error of content by excluding viable options as in you are either with us or against us you are not with us therefore you are against us 91 37 93 91 39 93 for the strawman fallacy on the other hand the error is found on the level of context a weak position is first described and then defeated even though the opponent does not hold this position but in another context against an opponent that actually defends the strawman position the argument is correct 91 28 93 91 37 93 other accounts draw the distinction based on investigating general forms of arguments in contrast to particular instances or on the study of logical constants instead of substantive concepts a further approach focuses on the discussion of logical topics with or without formal devices or on the role of epistemology for the assessment of arguments 91 15 93 91 23 93 fundamental concepts edit premises conclusions and truth edit premises and conclusions edit further information premise premises and conclusions are the basic parts of inferences or arguments and therefore play a central role in logic in the case of a valid inference or a correct argument the conclusion follows from the premises or in other words the premises support the conclusion 91 6 93 91 40 93 for instance the premises mars is red and mars is a planet support the conclusion mars is a red planet it is generally accepted that premises and conclusions have to be truth bearers 91 6 93 91 40 93 91 i 93 this means that they have a truth value they are either true or false thus contemporary philosophy generally sees them either as propositions or as sentences 91 6 93 propositions are the denotations of sentences and are usually understood as abstract objects 91 41 93 propositional theories of premises and conclusions are often criticized because of the difficulties involved in specifying the identity criteria of abstract objects or because of naturalist considerations 91 6 93 these objections are avoided by seeing premises and conclusions not as propositions but as sentences i e as concrete linguistic objects like the symbols displayed on a page of a book but this approach comes with new problems of its own sentences are often context dependent and ambiguous meaning an argument s validity would not only depend on its parts but also on its context and on how it is interpreted 91 6 93 91 42 93 in earlier work premises and conclusions were understood in psychological terms as thoughts or judgments in an approach known as psychologism this position was heavily criticized around the turn of the 20th century 91 6 93 91 43 93 91 44 93 internal structure edit premises and conclusions have internal structure as propositions or sentences they can be either simple or complex 91 45 93 91 46 93 a complex proposition has other propositions as its constituents which are linked to each other through propositional connectives like and or if then simple propositions on the other hand do not have propositional parts but they can also be conceived as having an internal structure they are made up of subpropositional parts like singular terms and predicates 91 40 93 91 45 93 91 46 93 for example the simple proposition mars is red can be formed by applying the predicate red to the singular term mars 91 40 93 in contrast the complex proposition mars is red and venus is white is made up of two simple propositions connected by the propositional connective and 91 40 93 whether a proposition is true depends at least in part on its constituents 91 46 93 for complex propositions formed using truth functional propositional connectives their truth only depends on the truth values of their parts 91 40 93 but this relation is more complicated in the case of simple propositions and their subpropositional parts these subpropositional parts have meanings of their own like referring to objects or classes of objects 91 40 93 91 47 93 91 48 93 whether the simple proposition they form is true depends on their relation to reality i e what the objects they refer to are like this topic is studied by theories of reference 91 48 93 logical truth edit further information logical truth in some cases a simple or a complex proposition is true independently of the substantive meanings of its parts 91 3 93 91 49 93 for example the complex proposition if mars is red then mars is red is true independent of whether its parts i e the simple proposition mars is red are true or false in such cases the truth is called a logical truth a proposition is logically true if its truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in it 91 17 93 91 49 93 this means that it is true under all interpretations of its non logical terms in some modal logics this notion can be understood equivalently as truth at all possible worlds 91 17 93 logical truth plays an important role in logic and some theorists even define logic as the study of logical truths 91 16 93 what is denominated as logical reflections can also count as logical truths double logical negation equals a truth can t open a door if there isn t a door can t search for a word in a dictionary if there are no words if there is no paper you can t write on it are examples of this truth tables edit truth tables can be used to show how logical connectives work or how the truth of complex propositions depends on their parts they have a column for each input variable each row corresponds to one possible combination of the truth values these variables can take the final columns present the truth values of the corresponding expressions as determined by the input values for example the expression p x2227 q displaystyle p land q uses the logical connective x2227 displaystyle land and it could be used to express a sentence like yesterday was sunday and the weather was good it is only true if both of its input variables p displaystyle p yesterday was sunday and q displaystyle q the weather was good are true in all other cases the expression as a whole is false other important logical connectives are x2228 displaystyle lor or x2192 displaystyle to if then and x00ac displaystyle lnot not 91 50 93 91 51 93 truth tables can also be defined for more complex expressions that use several propositional connectives for example given the conditional proposition p x2192 q displaystyle p to q one can form truth tables of its inverse x00ac p x2192 x00ac q displaystyle lnot p to lnot q and its contraposition x00ac q x2192 x00ac p displaystyle lnot q to lnot p 91 52 93 truth table of various expression p q p q p q p q p q t t t t t t t f f t f t f t f t t f f f f f t t arguments and inferences edit further information argument and inference logic is commonly defined in terms of arguments or inferences as the study of their correctness 91 3 93 91 6 93 an argument is a set of premises together with a conclusion 91 53 93 an inference is the process of reasoning from these premises to the conclusion 91 6 93 but these terms are often used interchangeably in logic arguments are correct or incorrect depending on whether their premises support their conclusion premises and conclusions on the other hand are true or false depending on whether they are in accord with reality in formal logic a sound argument is an argument that is both correct and has only true premises 91 54 93 sometimes a distinction is made between simple and complex arguments 91 6 93 a complex argument is made up of a chain of simple arguments these simple arguments constitute a chain because the conclusions of the earlier arguments are used as premises in the later arguments for a complex argument to be successful each link of the chain has to be successful 91 6 93 argument terminology used in logic arguments and inferences are either are correct or incorrect if they are correct then their premises support their conclusion in the incorrect case this support is missing it can take different forms corresponding to the different types of reasoning 91 55 93 91 34 93 91 56 93 the strongest form of support corresponds to deductive reasoning but even arguments that are not deductively valid may still constitute good arguments because their premises offer non deductive support to their conclusions for such cases the term ampliative or inductive reasoning is used 91 16 93 91 34 93 91 56 93 deductive arguments are associated with formal logic in contrast to the relation between ampliative arguments and informal logic 91 21 93 91 31 93 deductive edit a deductively valid argument is one whose premises guarantee the truth of its conclusion 91 7 93 91 15 93 for instance the argument victoria is tall victoria has brown hair therefore victoria is tall and has brown hair is deductively valid for deductive validity it does not matter whether the premises or the conclusion are actually true so the argument trees can speak the english language therefore trees can speak a language is valid because if the premise were true the conclusion would be true as well alfred tarski holds that deductive arguments have three essential features 1 they are formal i e they depend only on the form of the premises and the conclusion 2 they are a priori i e no sense experience is needed to determine whether they obtain 3 they are modal i e that they hold by logical necessity for the given propositions independent of any other circumstances 91 7 93 because of the first feature the focus on formality deductive inference is usually identified with rules of inference 91 57 93 rules of inference specify how the premises and the conclusion have to be structured for the inference to be valid arguments that do not follow any rule of inference are deductively invalid 91 58 93 91 59 93 the modus ponens is a prominent rule of inference it has the form p if p then q therefore q 91 59 93 knowing that it has just rained p displaystyle p and that after rain the streets are wet p x2192 q displaystyle p to q one can use modus ponens to deduce that the streets are wet q displaystyle q the third feature can be expressed by stating that deductively valid inferences are truth preserving it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false 91 5 93 91 34 93 91 60 93 because of this feature it is often asserted that deductive inferences are uninformative since the conclusion cannot arrive at new information not already present in the premises 91 32 93 91 33 93 but this point is not always accepted since it would mean for example that most of mathematics is uninformative a different characterization distinguishes between surface and depth information 91 32 93 91 61 93 91 62 93 on this view deductive inferences are uninformative on the depth level but can be highly informative on the surface level as may be the case for various mathematical proofs 91 32 93 91 61 93 91 62 93 ampliative edit ampliative inferences on the other hand are informative even on the depth level they are more interesting in this sense since the thinker may acquire substantive information from them and thereby learn something genuinely new 91 63 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 but this feature comes with a certain cost the premises support the conclusion in the sense that they make its truth more likely but they do not ensure its truth 91 5 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 this means that the conclusion of an ampliative argument may be false even though all its premises are true this characteristic is closely related to non monotonicity and defeasibility it may be necessary to retract an earlier conclusion upon receiving new information or in the light of new inferences drawn 91 3 93 91 64 93 91 60 93 ampliative reasoning is of central importance since many arguments found in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative ampliative arguments are not automatically incorrect instead they just follow different standards of correctness an important aspect of most ampliative arguments is that the support they provide for their conclusion comes in degrees 91 56 93 91 60 93 91 65 93 in this sense the line between correct and incorrect arguments is blurry in some cases as when the premises offer weak but non negligible support this contrasts with deductive arguments which are either valid or invalid with nothing in between 91 56 93 91 60 93 91 65 93 the terminology used to categorize ampliative arguments is inconsistent some authors use the term induction to cover all forms of non deductive arguments 91 56 93 91 65 93 91 66 93 but in a more narrow sense induction is only one type of ampliative argument besides abductive arguments 91 60 93 some authors also allow conductive arguments as one more type 91 21 93 91 67 93 in this narrow sense induction is often defined as a form of statistical generalization 91 68 93 91 69 93 in this case the premises of an inductive argument are many individual observations that all show a certain pattern the conclusion then is a general law that this pattern always obtains 91 70 93 in this sense one may infer that all elephants are gray based on one s past observations of the color of elephants 91 60 93 a closely related form of inductive inference has as its conclusion not a general law but one more specific instance as when it is inferred that an elephant one has not seen yet is also gray 91 70 93 some theorists stipulate that inductive inferences rest only on statistical considerations in order to distinguish them from abductive inference 91 60 93 abductive inference may or may not take statistical observations into consideration in either case the premises offer support for the conclusion because the conclusion is the best explanation of why the premises are true 91 60 93 91 71 93 91 ii 93 in this sense abduction is also called the inference to the best explanation 91 72 93 for example given the premise that there is a plate with breadcrumbs in the kitchen in the early morning one may infer the conclusion that one s house mate had a midnight snack and was too tired to clean the table this conclusion is justified because it is the best explanation of the current state of the kitchen 91 60 93 for abduction it is not sufficient that the conclusion explains the premises for example the conclusion that a burglar broke into the house last night got hungry on the job and had a midnight snack would also explain the state of the kitchen but this conclusion is not justified because it is not the best or most likely explanation 91 60 93 91 71 93 91 72 93 fallacies edit not all arguments live up to the standards of correct reasoning when they do not they are usually referred to as fallacies their central aspect is not that their conclusion is false but that there is some flaw with the reasoning leading to this conclusion 91 73 93 so the argument it is sunny today therefore spiders have eight legs is fallacious even though the conclusion is true some theorists give a more restrictive definition of fallacies by additionally requiring that they appear to be correct 91 28 93 91 74 93 this way genuine fallacies can be distinguished from mere mistakes of reasoning due to carelessness this explains why people tend to commit fallacies because they have an alluring element that seduces people into committing and accepting them 91 74 93 however this reference to appearances is controversial because it belongs to the field of psychology not logic and because appearances may be different for different people 91 74 93 91 75 93 young america s dilemma shall i be wise and great or rich and powerful poster from 1901 this is an example of a false dilemma an informal fallacy using a disjunctive premise that excludes viable alternatives fallacies are usually divided into formal and informal fallacies 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 for formal fallacies the source of the error is found in the form of the argument for example denying the antecedent is one type of formal fallacy as in if othello is a bachelor then he is male othello is not a bachelor therefore othello is not male 91 73 93 91 76 93 but most fallacies fall into the category of informal fallacies of which a great variety is discussed in the academic literature the source of their error is usually found in the content or the context of the argument 91 28 93 91 37 93 91 74 93 informal fallacies are sometimes categorized as fallacies of ambiguity fallacies of presumption or fallacies of relevance for fallacies of ambiguity the ambiguity and vagueness of natural language are responsible for their flaw as in feathers are light what is light cannot be dark therefore feathers cannot be dark 91 29 93 91 39 93 91 38 93 fallacies of presumption have a wrong or unjustified premise but may be valid otherwise 91 38 93 91 77 93 in the case of fallacies of relevance the premises do not support the conclusion because they are not relevant to it 91 38 93 91 39 93 definitory and strategic rules edit the main focus of most logicians is to investigate the criteria according to which an argument is correct or incorrect a fallacy is committed if these criteria are violated in the case of formal logic they are known as rules of inference 91 55 93 they constitute definitory rules which determine whether a certain inference is correct or which inferences are allowed definitory rules contrast with strategic rules 91 55 93 91 78 93 91 79 93 strategic rules specify which inferential moves are necessary in order to reach a given conclusion based on a certain set of premises 91 55 93 91 78 93 91 79 93 this distinction does not just apply to logic but also to various games as well in chess for example the definitory rules dictate that bishops may only move diagonally while the strategic rules describe how the allowed moves may be used to win a game for example by controlling the center and by defending one s king 91 55 93 91 78 93 91 79 93 a third type of rules concerns empirical descriptive rules they belong to the field of psychology and generalize how people actually draw inferences it has been argued that logicians should give more emphasis to strategic rules since they are highly relevant for effective reasoning 91 55 93 formal systems edit main article formal system a formal system of logic consists of a language a proof system and a semantics 91 80 93 the term a logic is often used a countable noun to refer to a particular formal system of logic 91 4 93 91 81 93 91 19 93 starting in the 20th century many new formal systems have been proposed 91 iii 93 91 4 93 91 20 93 91 19 93 formal language edit main article formal language a formal language consists of an alphabet and syntactic rules the alphabet is the set of basic symbols used in expressions the syntactic rules determine how these symbols may be arranged to result in well formed formulas 91 82 93 91 83 93 91 84 93 for instance the syntactic rules of propositional logic determine that p x2227 q displaystyle p land q is a well formed formula but p q x2227 x2227 x2227 displaystyle pq land land land is not proof system edit main article proof system a proof system is a collection of formal rules which define when a conclusion follows from given premises for instance the classical rule of conjunction introduction states that p x2227 q displaystyle p land q follows from the premises p displaystyle p and q displaystyle q rules in a proof systems are always defined in terms of formulas syntactic form never in terms of their meanings such rules can be applied sequentially giving a mechanical procedure for generating conclusions from premises there are a number of different types of proof systems including natural deduction and sequent calculi 91 80 93 91 85 93 91 86 93 proof systems are closely linked to philosophical work which characterizes logic as the study of valid inference 91 4 93 semantics edit main article semantics of logic a semantics is a system for mapping expressions of a formal language to their denotations in many systems of logic denotations are truth values for instance the semantics for classical propositional logic assigns the formula p x2227 q displaystyle p land q the denotation true whenever p displaystyle p and q displaystyle q are true entailment is a semantic relation which holds between formulas when the first cannot be true without the second being true as well 91 87 93 91 88 93 semantics is closely tied to the philosophical characterization of logic as the study of logical truth 91 89 93 soundness and completeness edit main articles soundness completeness logic and metalogic a system of logic is sound when its proof system cannot derive a conclusion from a set of premises unless it is semantically entailed by them in other words its proof system cannot lead to false conclusions as defined by the semantics a system is complete when its proof system can derive every conclusion that is semantically entailed by its premises in other words its proof system can lead to any true conclusion as defined by the semantics thus soundness and completeness together describe a system whose notions of validity and entailment line up perfectly 91 90 93 91 91 93 91 92 93 the study of properties of formal systems is called metalogic other important metalogical properties include consistency decidability and expressive power 91 93 93 systems of logic edit systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of reasoning and arguments for over two thousand years aristotelian logic was treated as the canon of logic in the western world 91 19 93 91 94 93 91 95 93 but modern developments in this field have led to a vast proliferation of logical systems 91 96 93 one prominent categorization divides modern formal logical systems into classical logic extended logics and deviant logics 91 4 93 91 96 93 91 97 93 classical logic is to be distinguished from traditional or aristotelian logic it encompasses propositional logic and first order logic it is classical in the sense that it is based on various fundamental logical intuitions shared by most logicians 91 3 93 91 98 93 these intuitions include the law of excluded middle the double negation elimination the principle of explosion and the bivalence of truth 91 99 93 it was originally developed to analyze mathematical arguments and was only later applied to other fields as well because of this focus on mathematics it does not include logical vocabulary relevant to many other topics of philosophical importance like the distinction between necessity and possibility the problem of ethical obligation and permission or the relations between past present and future 91 100 93 such issues are addressed by extended logics they build on the fundamental intuitions of classical logic and expand it by introducing new logical vocabulary this way the exact logical approach is applied to fields like ethics or epistemology that lie beyond the scope of mathematics 91 19 93 91 101 93 91 102 93 deviant logics on the other hand reject some of the fundamental intuitions of classical logic 91 96 93 91 97 93 because of this they are usually seen not as its supplements but as its rivals deviant logical systems differ from each other either because they reject different classical intuitions or because they propose different alternatives to the same issue 91 96 93 91 97 93 informal logic is usually carried out in a less systematic way it often focuses on more specific issues like investigating a particular type of fallacy or studying a certain aspect of argumentation 91 21 93 nonetheless some systems of informal logic have also been presented that try to provide a systematic characterization of the correctness of arguments 91 74 93 91 103 93 91 104 93 aristotelian edit aristotelian logic encompasses a great variety of topics including metaphysical theses about ontological categories and problems of scientific explanation 91 94 93 91 95 93 91 105 93 but in a more narrow sense it refers to term logic or syllogistics a syllogism is a certain form of argument involving three propositions two premises and a conclusion each proposition has three essential parts a subject a predicate and a copula connecting the subject to the predicate 91 94 93 91 95 93 91 105 93 for example the proposition socrates is wise is made up of the subject socrates the predicate wise and the copula is 91 95 93 the subject and the predicate are the terms of the proposition in this sense aristotelian logic does not contain complex propositions made up of various simple propositions 91 94 93 it differs in this aspect from propositional logic in which any two propositions can be linked using a logical connective like and to form a new complex proposition 91 106 93 the square of opposition is often used to visualize the relations between the four basic categorical propositions in aristotelian logic it shows for example that the propositions all s are p and some s are not p are contradictory meaning that one of them has to be true while the other is false aristotelian logic differs from predicate logic in that the subject is either universal particular indefinite or singular 91 94 93 91 105 93 91 107 93 for example the term all humans is a universal subject in the proposition all humans are mortal a similar proposition could be formed by replacing it with the particular term some humans the indefinite term a human or the singular term socrates 91 94 93 91 105 93 91 107 93 in predicate logic on the other hand universal and particular propositions would be expressed by using a quantifier and two predicates 91 94 93 another important difference is that aristotelian logic only includes predicates for simple properties of entities but lacks predicates corresponding to relations between entities 91 108 93 the predicate can be linked to the subject in two ways either by affirming it or by denying it 91 94 93 91 95 93 for example the proposition socrates is not a cat involves the denial of the predicate cat to the subject socrates using different combinations of subjects and predicates a great variety of propositions and syllogisms can be formed syllogisms are characterized by the fact that the premises are linked to each other and to the conclusion by sharing one predicate in each case 91 94 93 91 109 93 91 110 93 thus these three propositions contain three predicates referred to as major term minor term and middle term 91 95 93 91 109 93 91 110 93 the central aspect of aristotelian logic involves classifying all possible syllogisms into valid and invalid arguments according to how the propositions are formed 91 94 93 91 95 93 91 109 93 for example the syllogism all men are mortal socrates is a man therefore socrates is mortal is valid the syllogism all cats are mortal socrates is mortal therefore socrates is a cat on the other hand is invalid classical edit propositional logic edit main article propositional calculus propositional logic comprises formal systems in which formulae are built from atomic propositions using logical connectives for instance propositional logic represents the conjunction of two atomic propositions p displaystyle p and q displaystyle q as the complex formula p x2227 q displaystyle p land q unlike predicate logic where terms and predicates are the smallest units propositional logic takes full propositions with truth values as its most basic component 91 111 93 thus propositional logics can only represent logical relationships that arise from the way complex propositions are built from simpler ones it cannot represent inferences that results from the inner structure of a proposition 91 112 93 first order logic edit gottlob frege s begriffschrift introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation which here represents the judgement that x2200 x f x displaystyle forall x f x is true main article first order logic first order logic includes the same propositional connectives as propositional logic but differs from it because it articulates the internal structure of propositions this happens through devices such as singular terms which refer to particular objects predicates which refer to properties and relations and quantifiers which treat notions like some and all 91 40 93 91 45 93 91 48 93 for example to express the proposition this raven is black one may use the predicate b displaystyle b for the property black and the singular term r displaystyle r referring to the raven to form the expression b r displaystyle b r to express that some objects are black the existential quantifier x2203 displaystyle exists is combined with the variable x displaystyle x to form the proposition x2203 x b x displaystyle exists xb x first order logic contains various rules of inference that determine how expressions articulated this way can form valid arguments for example that one may infer x2203 x b x displaystyle exists xb x from b r displaystyle b r 91 113 93 91 114 93 gottlob frege developed the first fully axiomatic system of first order logic 91 115 93 the development of first order logic is usually attributed to gottlob frege who is also credited as one of the founders of analytic philosophy however the formulation of first order logic most often used today is found in principles of mathematical logic by david hilbert and wilhelm ackermann in 1928 91 116 93 the analytical generality of first order logic allowed the formalization of mathematics drove the investigation of set theory and allowed the development of alfred tarski s approach to model theory it provides the foundation of modern mathematical logic 91 117 93 extended edit modal logic edit further information modal logic many extended logics take the form of modal logic by introducing modal operators modal logics were originally developed to represent statements about necessity and possibility for instance the modal formula x25ca p displaystyle diamond p can be read as possibly p displaystyle p while x25fb p displaystyle box p can be read as necessarily p displaystyle p modal logics can be used to represent different phenomena depending on what flavor of necessity and possibility is under consideration when x25fb displaystyle box is used to represent epistemic necessity x25fb p displaystyle box p states that p displaystyle p is known when x25fb displaystyle box is used to represent deontic necessity x25fb p displaystyle box p states that p displaystyle p is a moral or legal obligation within philosophy modal logics are widely used in formal epistemology formal ethics and metaphysics within linguistic semantics systems based on modal logic are used to analyze linguistic modality in natural languages 91 118 93 91 119 93 91 120 93 other fields such as computer science and set theory have applied the relational semantics for modal logic beyond its original conceptual motivation using it to provide insight into patterns including the set theoretic multiverse and transition systems in computation 91 120 93 91 121 93 higher order logic edit further information higher order logic higher order logics extend classical logic not by using modal operators but by introducing new forms of quantification 91 6 93 91 122 93 91 123 93 quantifiers correspond to terms like all or some in classical first order logic quantifiers are only applied to individuals the formula x2203 x a p p l e x x2227 s w e e t x displaystyle exists x apple x land sweet x some apples are sweet is an example of the existential quantifier x2203 displaystyle exists applied to the individual variable x displaystyle x in higher order logics quantification is also allowed over predicates this increases its expressive power for example to express the idea that mary and john share some qualities one could use the formula x2203 q q m a r y x2227 q j o h n displaystyle exists q q mary land q john in this case the existential quantifier is applied to the predicate variable q displaystyle q 91 6 93 91 122 93 91 124 93 the added expressive power is especially useful for mathematics since it allows for more succinct formulations of mathematical theories 91 6 93 but it has various drawbacks in regard to its meta logical properties and ontological implications which is why first order logic is still much more widely used 91 6 93 91 123 93 deviant edit a great variety of deviant logics have been proposed one major paradigm is intuitionistic logic which rejects the law of the excluded middle intuitionism was developed by the dutch mathematicians l e j brouwer and arend heyting to underpin their constructive approach to mathematics in which the existence of a mathematical object can only be proven by constructing it intuitionism was further pursued by gerhard gentzen kurt g del michael dummett among others intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists as it is a constructive logic and sees many applications such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of programming languages through the formulae as types correspondence it is closely related to nonclassical systems such as g del dummett logic and inquisitive logic 91 125 93 91 126 93 91 127 93 multi valued logics depart from classicality by rejecting the principle of bivalence which requires all propositions to be either true or false for instance jan ukasiewicz and stephen cole kleene both proposed ternary logics which have a third truth value representing that a statement s truth value is indeterminate 91 128 93 91 129 93 91 130 93 these logics have seen applications including to presupposition in linguistics fuzzy logics are multivalued logics that have an infinite number of degrees of truth represented by a real number between 0 and 1 91 131 93 paraconsistent logics are logical systems that can deal with contradictions they are formulated to avoid the principle of explosion for them it is not the case that anything follows from a contradiction 91 101 93 91 132 93 91 133 93 they are often motivated by dialetheism the view that contradictions are real or that reality itself is contradictory graham priest is an important contemporary proponent of this position and similar views have been ascribed to georg wilhelm friedrich hegel 91 132 93 91 133 93 91 134 93 informal edit the pragmatic or dialogical approach to informal logic sees arguments as speech acts and not merely as a set of premises together with a conclusion 91 74 93 91 103 93 91 104 93 as speech acts they occur in a certain context like a dialogue which affects the standards of right and wrong arguments 91 28 93 91 104 93 a prominent version by douglas n walton understands a dialogue as a game between two players 91 74 93 the initial position of each player is characterized by the propositions to which they are committed and the conclusion they intend to prove dialogues are games of persuasion each player has the goal of convincing the opponent of their own conclusion 91 28 93 this is achieved by making arguments arguments are the moves of the game 91 28 93 91 104 93 they affect to which propositions the players are committed a winning move is a successful argument that takes the opponent s commitments as premises and shows how one s own conclusion follows from them 91 28 93 this is usually not possible straight away for this reason it is normally necessary to formulate a sequence of arguments as intermediary steps each of which brings the opponent a little closer to one s intended conclusion besides these positive arguments leading one closer to victory there are also negative arguments preventing the opponent s victory by denying their conclusion 91 28 93 whether an argument is correct depends on whether it promotes the progress of the dialogue fallacies on the other hand are violations of the standards of proper argumentative rules 91 74 93 91 75 93 these standards also depend on the type of dialogue for example the standards governing the scientific discourse differ from the standards in business negiotiations 91 104 93 the epistemic approach to informal logic on the other hand focuses on the epistemic role of arguments 91 74 93 91 103 93 it is based on the idea that arguments aim to increase our knowledge they achieve this by linking justified beliefs to beliefs that are not yet justified 91 135 93 correct arguments succeed at expanding knowledge while fallacies are epistemic failures they do not justify the belief in their conclusion 91 74 93 91 103 93 in this sense logical normativity consists in epistemic success or rationality 91 135 93 for example the fallacy of begging the question is a fallacy because it fails to provide independent justification for its conclusion even though it is deductively valid 91 39 93 91 135 93 the bayesian approach is one example of an epistemic approach 91 74 93 central to bayesianism is not just whether the agent believes something but the degree to which they believe it the so called credence degrees of belief are understood as subjective probabilities in the believed proposition i e as how certain the agent is that the proposition is true 91 136 93 91 137 93 91 138 93 on this view reasoning can be interpreted as a process of changing one s credences often in reaction to new incoming information 91 74 93 correct reasoning and the arguments it is based on follows the laws of probability for example the principle of conditionalization bad or irrational reasoning on the other hand violates these laws 91 103 93 91 137 93 91 139 93 areas of research edit logic is studied in various fields in many cases this is done by applying its formal method to specific topics outside its scope like to ethics or computer science 91 3 93 91 4 93 in other cases logic itself is made the subject of research in another discipline this can happen in diverse ways like by investigating the philosophical presuppositions of fundamental logical concepts by interpreting and analyzing logic through mathematical structures or by studying and comparing abstract properties of formal logical systems 91 3 93 91 140 93 91 141 93 philosophy of logic and philosophical logic edit main articles philosophy of logic and philosophical logic philosophy of logic is the philosophical discipline studying the scope and nature of logic 91 3 93 91 6 93 it investigates many presuppositions implicit in logic like how to define its fundamental concepts or the metaphysical assumptions associated with them 91 19 93 it is also concerned with how to classify the different logical systems and considers the ontological commitments they incur 91 3 93 philosophical logic is one important area within the philosophy of logic it studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems in fields like metaphysics ethics and epistemology 91 19 93 91 100 93 this application usually happens in the form of extended or deviant logical systems 91 102 93 91 20 93 mathematical logic edit main article mathematical logic mathematical logic is the study of logic within mathematics major subareas include model theory proof theory set theory and computability theory 91 142 93 bertrand russell made various significant contributions to mathematical logic 91 143 93 research in mathematical logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic however it can also include attempts to use logic to analyze mathematical reasoning or to establish logic based foundations of mathematics 91 144 93 the latter was a major concern in early 20th century mathematical logic which pursued the program of logicism pioneered by philosopher logicians such as gottlob frege and bertrand russell mathematical theories were supposed to be logical tautologies and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic 91 145 93 the various attempts to carry this out met with failure from the crippling of frege s project in his grundgesetze by russell s paradox to the defeat of hilbert s program by g del s incompleteness theorems 91 146 93 set theory originated in the study of the infinite by georg cantor and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic they include cantor s theorem the status of the axiom of choice the question of the independence of the continuum hypothesis and the modern debate on large cardinal axioms 91 147 93 91 148 93 recursion theory captures the idea of computation in logical and arithmetic terms its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the entscheidungsproblem by alan turing and his presentation of the church turing thesis 91 149 93 today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of complexity classes and the classification of degrees of unsolvability 91 150 93 computational logic edit main articles computational logic and logic in computer science conjunction and is one of the basic operations of boolean logic it can be electronically implemented in several ways for example by using two transistors in computer science logic is studied as part of the theory of computation key areas of logic that are relevant to computing include computability theory modal logic and category theory early computer machinery was based on ideas from logic such as the lambda calculus 91 151 93 91 152 93 91 153 93 computer scientists also apply concepts from logic to problems in computing and vice versa the works of claude shannon were influential in this regard he showed how boolean logic can be used to understand and implement computer circuits 91 154 93 91 155 93 the interaction between the two disciplines can be seen for example in how modern artificial intelligence builds on logicians work in argumentation theory while automated theorem proving can assist logicians in finding and checking proofs 91 156 93 in logic programming languages such as prolog a program computes the consequences of logical axioms and rules to answer a query 91 157 93 formal semantics of natural language edit main article formal semantics natural language formal semantics a subfield of both linguistics and philosophy uses logic to analyze meaning in natural language it is an empirical field which seeks to characterize the denotations of linguistic expressions and explain how those denotations are composed from the meanings of their parts the field was developed by richard montague and barbara partee in the 1970s and remains an active area of research central questions include scope binding and linguistic modality 91 158 93 91 159 93 91 160 93 epistemology of logic edit the epistemology of logic investigates how one knows that an argument is valid or that a proposition is logically true 91 161 93 91 162 93 this includes questions like how to justify that modus ponens is a valid rule of inference or that contradictions are false 91 161 93 the traditionally dominant view is that this form of logical understanding belongs to knowledge a priori 91 162 93 in this regard it is often argued that the mind has a special faculty to examine relations between pure ideas and that this faculty is also responsible for apprehending logical truths 91 163 93 a similar approach understands the rules of logic in terms of linguistic conventions on this view the laws of logic are trivial since they are true by definition they just express the meanings of the logical vocabulary 91 161 93 91 163 93 91 164 93 important objections to the view that logic is knowable a priori were presented in the 20th century by w v quine and hilary putnam in his paper is logic empirical 91 165 93 putnam builds on a suggestion by quine and argues that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe this pertains for example to the laws of mechanics or of general relativity and in particular to what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics according to putnam these insights provide a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic if one wants to be a realist about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory then one should abandon the principle of distributivity he suggests that classical logic be replaced with the quantum logic proposed by garrett birkhoff and john von neumann 91 166 93 history edit main article history of logic top row aristotle who established the canon of western philosophy 91 95 93 and avicenna who replaced aristotelian logic in islamic discourse 91 167 93 bottom row william of ockham a major figure of medieval scholarly thought 91 168 93 and the principia mathematica which had a large impact on modern logic logic was developed independently in several cultures during antiquity one major early contributor was aristotle who developed term logic in his organon and prior analytics 91 169 93 91 170 93 in this approach judgements are broken down into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations inferences are expressed by means of syllogisms that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises aristotle s monumental insight was the notion that arguments can be characterized in terms of their form the later logician ukasiewicz described this insight as one of aristotle s greatest inventions 91 170 93 aristotle s system of logic was also responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism 91 171 93 temporal modal logic 91 172 93 91 173 93 and inductive logic 91 174 93 as well as influential vocabulary such as terms predicables syllogisms and propositions aristotelian logic was highly regarded in classical and medieval times both in europe and the middle east it remained in wide use in the west until the early 19th century 91 175 93 it has now been superseded by later work though many of its key insights are still present in modern systems of logic 91 176 93 ibn sina avicenna 980 1037 ce was the founder of avicennian logic which replaced aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the islamic world 91 177 93 it also had an important influence on western medieval writers such as albertus magnus 91 178 93 and william of ockham 91 179 93 ibn sina wrote on the hypothetical syllogism 91 180 93 and on the propositional calculus 91 181 93 he developed an original temporally modalized syllogistic theory involving temporal logic and modal logic 91 182 93 he also made use of inductive logic such as his methods of agreement difference and concomitant variation which are critical to the scientific method 91 180 93 fakhr al din al razi b 1149 criticised aristotle s first figure and formulated an early system of inductive logic foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by john stuart mill 1806 1873 91 183 93 in europe during the later medieval period major efforts were made to show that aristotle s ideas were compatible with christian faith during the high middle ages logic became a main focus of philosophers who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments often using variations of the methodology of scholasticism initially medieval christian scholars drew on the classics that had been preserved in latin through commentaries by such figures such as boethius 91 184 93 later the work of islamic philosophers such as ibn sina and ibn rushd averroes 1126 1198 ce were drawn on this expanded the range of ancient works available to medieval christian scholars since more greek work was available to muslim scholars that had been preserved in latin commentaries in 1323 william of ockham s influential summa logicae was released 91 184 93 by the 18th century the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour as depicted in holberg s satirical play erasmus montanus friedrich nietzsche criticized logic based on the claim that the logical structure of thought is a useful tool for human survival while l ogic itself rests upon assumptions to which nothing in the world of reality corresponds 91 185 93 91 186 93 the chinese logical philosopher gongsun long c 325 250 bce proposed the paradox one and one cannot become two since neither becomes two in china the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic however was repressed by the qin dynasty following the legalist philosophy of han feizi 91 187 93 in india the anviksiki school of logic was founded by medh tithi c 6th century bce 91 188 93 innovations in the scholastic school called nyaya continued from ancient times into the early 18th century with the navya ny ya school by the 16th century it developed theories resembling modern logic such as gottlob frege s distinction between sense and reference of proper names and his definition of number 91 189 93 its development of the theory of restrictive conditions for universals anticipated some of the developments in modern set theory 91 iv 93 since 1824 indian logic attracted the attention of many western scholars and has had an influence on important 19th century logicians such as charles babbage augustus de morgan and george boole 91 190 93 in the 20th century western philosophers like stanislaw schayer and klaus glashoff have explored indian logic more extensively 91 191 93 the syllogistic logic developed by aristotle predominated in the west until the mid 19th century when interest in the foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic logic now called mathematical logic in 1854 george boole published the laws of thought 91 192 93 introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as boolean logic in 1879 gottlob frege published begriffsschrift which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation this invention reconciled the aristotelian and stoic logics in a broader system and solved problems for which aristotelian logic was impotent such as the problem of multiple generality from 1910 to 1913 alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell published principia mathematica 91 145 93 on the foundations of mathematics attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic in 1931 g del raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues 91 146 93 the development of logic since frege russell and wittgenstein had a profound
