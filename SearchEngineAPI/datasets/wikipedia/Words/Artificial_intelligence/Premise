premise from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion this article is about the usage of premise in discourse and logic for other uses see premise disambiguation a premise or premiss 91 a 93 is a true or false statement that helps form the body of an argument which logically leads to a true or false conclusion 91 1 93 a premise makes a declarative statement about its subject matter which enables a reader to either agree or disagree with the premise in question and in doing so understand the logical assumptions of the argument if a premise is logically false then the conclusion which follows from all of the premises of the argument must also be false unless the conclusion is supported by a logically valid argument which the reader agrees with therefore if the reader disagrees with any one of the argument s premises they have a logical basis to reject the conclusion of the argument contents 1 explanation 2 see also 3 notes 4 references 5 external links explanation edit in logic an argument requires a set of at least two declarative sentences or propositions known as the premises or premisses along with another declarative sentence or proposition known as the conclusion this structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure more complex arguments can use a sequence of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions an example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to two premises and a conclusion 91 2 93 premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises for example socrates is mortal because all men are mortal it is evident that a tacitly understood claim is that socrates is a man the fully expressed reasoning is thus because all men are mortal and socrates is a man socrates is mortal in this example the dependent clauses preceding the comma namely all men are mortal and socrates is a man are the premises while socrates is mortal is the conclusion the proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument also additional information is required over and above the meaning of the premise to determine if the full meaning of the conclusion coincides with what is 91 3 93 for euclid premises constitute two of the three propositions in a syllogism with the other being the conclusion 91 4 93 these categorical propositions contain three terms subject and predicate of the conclusion and the middle term the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term while the predicate is the major term the premise that contains the middle term and major term is called the major premise while the premise that contains the middle term and minor term is called the minor premise 91 5 93 a premise can also be an indicator word if statements have been combined into a logical argument and such word functions to mark the role of one or more of the statements 91 6 93 it indicates that the statement it is attached to is a premise 91 6 93 see also edit conditional disambiguation corresponding conditional false premise
