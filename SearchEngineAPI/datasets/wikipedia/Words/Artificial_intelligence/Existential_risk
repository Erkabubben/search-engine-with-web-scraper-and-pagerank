being and animal well being on a global scale 91 2 93 even endangering or destroying modern civilization 91 3 93 an event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanity s potential is known as an existential risk 91 4 93 over the last two decades a number of academic and non profit organizations have been established to research global catastrophic and existential risks formulate potential mitigation measures and either advocate for or implement these measures 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 contents 1 definition and classification 1 1 defining

from bostrom s paper existential risk prevention as global priority 91 9 93 defining global catastrophic risks edit the term global catastrophic risk lacks a sharp definition and generally refers loosely to a risk that could inflict serious damage to human well being on a global scale 91 10 93 humanity has suffered large catastrophes before some of these have caused serious damage but were only local in scope e g the black death may have resulted in the deaths of a third of europe s population 91 11 93 10 of the global population at the time 91 12 93 some were global but were not as severe e g the 1918 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 3 6 of the world s population 91 13 93 most global catastrophic risks would not be so intense as to kill the majority of life on earth but even if one did the ecosystem and humanity would eventually recover in contrast to existential risks similarly in catastrophe risk and response richard posner singles out and groups together events that bring about utter overthrow or ruin on a global rather than a local or regional scale posner highlights such events as worthy of special attention on cost benefit grounds because they could directly or indirectly jeopardize the survival of the human race as a whole 91 14 93 defining existential risks edit existential risks are defined as risks that threaten the destruction of humanity s long term potential 91 15 93 the instantiation of an existential risk an existential catastrophe 91 16 93 would either cause outright human extinction or irreversibly lock in a drastically inferior state of affairs 91 9 93 91 17 93 existential risks are a sub class of global catastrophic risks where the damage is not only global but also terminal and permanent preventing recovery and thereby affecting both current and all future generations 91 9 93 non extinction risks edit while extinction is the most obvious way in which humanity s long term potential could be destroyed there are others including unrecoverable collapse and unrecoverable dystopia 91 18 93 a disaster severe enough to cause the permanent irreversible collapse of human civilisation would constitute an existential catastrophe even if it fell short of extinction 91 18 93 similarly if humanity fell under a totalitarian regime and there were no chance of recovery then such a dystopia would also be an existential catastrophe 91 19 93 bryan caplan writes that perhaps an eternity of totalitarianism would be worse than extinction 91 19 93 george orwell s novel nineteen eighty four suggests 91 20 93 an example 91 21 93 a dystopian scenario shares the key features of extinction and unrecoverable collapse of civilisation before the catastrophe humanity faced a vast range of bright futures to choose from after the catastrophe humanity is locked forever in a terrible state 91 18 93 potential sources of risk edit main article global catastrophe scenarios potential global catastrophic risks are conventionally classified as anthropogenic or non anthropogenic hazards 160 examples of non anthropogenic risks are an asteroid impact event a supervolcanic eruption a lethal gamma ray burst a geomagnetic storm destroying electronic equipment natural long term climate change hostile extraterrestrial life or the predictable sun transforming into a red giant star engulfing the earth anthropogenic risks are those caused by humans and include those related to technology governance and climate change technological risks include the creation of artificial intelligence misaligned with human goals biotechnology and nanotechnology insufficient or malign global governance creates risks in the social and political domain such as global war and nuclear holocaust bioterrorism using genetically modified organisms cyberterrorism destroying critical infrastructure like the electrical grid or the failure to manage a natural or engineered pandemic global catastrophic risks in the domain of earth system governance include global warming environmental degradation extinction of species famine as a result of non equitable resource distribution human overpopulation crop failures and non sustainable agriculture methodological challenges edit research into the nature and mitigation of global catastrophic risks and existential risks is subject to a unique set of challenges and as a result is not easily subjected to the usual standards of scientific rigour 91 18 93 for instance it is neither feasible nor ethical to study these risks experimentally carl sagan expressed this with regards to nuclear war understanding the long term consequences of nuclear war is not a problem amenable to experimental verification 91 22 93 moreover many catastrophic risks change rapidly as technology advances and background conditions such as geopolitical conditions change another challenge is the general difficulty of accurately predicting the future over long timescales especially for anthropogenic risks which depend on complex human political economic and social systems 91 18 93 in addition to known and tangible risks unforeseeable black swan extinction events may occur presenting an additional methodological problem 91 18 93 91 23 93 lack of historical precedent edit humanity has never suffered an existential catastrophe and if one were to occur it would necessarily be unprecedented 91 18 93 therefore existential risks pose unique challenges to prediction even more than other long term events because of observation selection effects 91 24 93 unlike with most events the failure of a complete extinction event to occur in the past is not evidence against their likelihood in the future because every world that has experienced such an extinction event has no observers so regardless of their frequency no civilization observes existential risks in its history 91 24 93 these anthropic issues may partly be avoided by looking at evidence that does not have such selection effects such as asteroid impact craters on the moon or directly evaluating the likely impact of new technology 91 9 93 to understand the dynamics of an unprecedented unrecoverable global civilizational collapse a type of existential risk it may be instructive to study the various local civilizational collapses that have occurred throughout human history 91 25 93 for instance civilizations such as the roman empire have ended in a loss of centralized governance and a major civilization wide loss of infrastructure and advanced technology however these examples demonstrate that societies appear to be fairly resilient to catastrophe for example medieval europe survived the black death without suffering anything resembling a civilization collapse despite losing 25 to 50 percent of its population 91 26 93 incentives and coordination edit there are economic reasons that can explain why so little effort is going into existential risk reduction it is a global public good so we should expect it to be undersupplied by markets 91 9 93 even if a large nation invests in risk mitigation measures that nation will enjoy only a small fraction of the benefit of doing so furthermore existential risk reduction is an intergenerational global public good since most of the benefits of existential risk reduction would be enjoyed by future generations and though these future people would in theory perhaps be willing to pay substantial sums for existential risk reduction no mechanism for such a transaction exists 91 9 93 cognitive biases edit numerous cognitive biases can influence people s judgment of the importance of existential risks including scope insensitivity hyperbolic discounting availability heuristic the conjunction fallacy the affect heuristic and the overconfidence effect 91 27 93 scope insensitivity influences how bad people consider the extinction of the human race to be for example when people are motivated to donate money to altruistic causes the quantity they are willing to give does not increase linearly with the magnitude of the issue people are roughly as willing to prevent the deaths of 200 000 or 2 000 birds 91 28 93 similarly people are often more concerned about threats to individuals than to larger groups 91 27 93 eliezer yudkowsky theorizes that scope neglect plays a role in public perception of existential risks 91 29 93 91 30 93 substantially larger numbers such as 500 million deaths and especially qualitatively different scenarios such as the extinction of the entire human species seem to trigger a different mode of thinking people who would never dream of hurting a child hear of existential risk and say well maybe the human species doesn t really deserve to survive all past predictions of human extinction have proven to be false to some this makes future warnings seem less credible nick bostrom argues that the absence of human extinction in the past is weak evidence that there will be no human extinction in the future due to survivor bias and other anthropic effects 91 31 93 sociobiologist e o wilson argued that the reason for this myopic fog evolutionary biologists contend is that it was actually advantageous during all but the last few millennia of the two million years of existence of the genus homo a premium was placed on close attention to the near future and early reproduction and little else disasters of a magnitude that occur only once every few centuries were forgotten or transmuted into myth 91 32 93 proposed mitigation edit multi layer defense edit defense in depth is a useful framework for categorizing risk mitigation measures into three layers of defense 91 33 93 prevention reducing the probability of a catastrophe occurring in the first place example measures to prevent outbreaks of new highly infectious diseases response preventing the scaling of a catastrophe to the global level example measures to prevent escalation of a small scale nuclear exchange into an all out nuclear war resilience increasing humanity s resilience against extinction when faced with global catastrophes example measures to increase food security during a nuclear winter human extinction is most likely when all three defenses are weak that is by risks we are unlikely to prevent unlikely to successfully respond to and unlikely to be resilient against 91 33 93 the unprecedented nature of existential risks poses a special challenge in designing risk mitigation measures since humanity will not be able to learn from a track record of previous events 91 18 93 funding edit some researchers argue that both research and other initiatives relating to existential risk are underfunded nick bostrom states that more research has been done on star trek snowboarding or dung beetles than on existential risks bostrom s comparisons have been criticized as high handed 91 34 93 91 35 93 as of 2020 the biological weapons convention organization had an annual budget of us 1 4 160 million 91 36 93 survival planning edit some scholars propose the establishment on earth of one or more self sufficient remote permanently occupied settlements specifically created for the purpose of surviving a global disaster 91 37 93 91 38 93 91 39 93 economist robin hanson argues that a refuge permanently housing as few as 100 people would significantly improve the chances of human survival during a range of global catastrophes 91 37 93 91 40 93 food storage has been proposed globally but the monetary cost would be high furthermore it would likely contribute to the current millions of deaths per year due to malnutrition 91 41 93 in 2022 a team led by david denkenberger modeled the cost effectiveness of resilient foods to artificial general intelligence agi safety and found 98 99 confidence for a higher marginal impact of work on resilient foods 91 42 93 some survivalists stock survival retreats with multiple year food supplies the svalbard global seed vault is buried 400 feet 120 160 m inside a mountain on an island in the arctic it is designed to hold 2 5 160 billion seeds from more than 100 countries as a precaution to preserve the world s crops the surrounding rock is 6 160 c 21 160 f as of 2015 but the vault is kept at 18 160 c 0 160 f by refrigerators powered by locally sourced coal 91 43 93 91 44 93 more speculatively if society continues to function and if the biosphere remains habitable calorie needs for the present human population might in theory be met during an extended absence of sunlight given sufficient advance planning conjectured solutions include growing mushrooms on the dead plant biomass left in the wake of the catastrophe converting cellulose to sugar or feeding natural gas to methane digesting bacteria 91 45 93 91 46 93 global catastrophic risks and global governance edit insufficient global governance creates risks in the social and political domain but the governance mechanisms develop more slowly than technological and social change there are concerns from governments the private sector as well as the general public about the lack of governance mechanisms to efficiently deal with risks negotiate and adjudicate between diverse and conflicting interests this is further underlined by an understanding of the interconnectedness of global systemic risks 91 47 93 in absence or anticipation of global governance national governments can act individually to better understand mitigate and prepare for global catastrophes 91 48 93 climate emergency plans edit in 2018 the club of rome called for greater climate change action and published its climate emergency plan which proposes ten action points to limit global average temperature increase to 1 5 degrees celsius 91 49 93 further in 2019 the club published the more comprehensive planetary emergency plan 91 50 93 there is evidence to suggest that collectively engaging with the emotional experiences that emerge during contemplating the vulnerability of the human species within the context of climate change allows for these experiences to be adaptive when collective engaging with and processing emotional experiences is supportive this can lead to growth in resilience psychological flexibility tolerance of emotional experiences and community engagement 91 51 93 space colonization edit main article space and survival space colonization is a proposed alternative to improve the odds of surviving an extinction scenario 91 52 93 solutions of this scope may require megascale engineering astrophysicist stephen hawking advocated colonizing other planets within the solar system once technology progresses sufficiently in order to improve the chance of human survival from planet wide events such as global thermonuclear war 91 53 93 91 54 93 billionaire elon musk writes that humanity must become a multiplanetary species in order to avoid extinction 91 55 93 musk is using his company spacex to develop technology he hopes will be used in the colonization of mars moving the earth edit main article moving earth in a few billion years the sun will expand into a red giant swallowing the earth this can be avoided by moving the earth farther out from the sun keeping the temperature roughly constant that can be accomplished by tweaking the orbits of comets and asteroids so they pass close to the earth in such a way that they add energy to the earth s orbit 91 56 93 since the sun s expansion is slow roughly one such encounter every 6 000 years would suffice 91 citation needed 93 skeptics and opponents edit psychologist steven pinker has called existential risk a useless category that can distract from real threats such as climate change and nuclear war 91 34 93 organizations edit the bulletin of the atomic scientists est 1945 is one of the oldest global risk organizations founded after the public became alarmed by the potential of atomic warfare in the aftermath of wwii it studies risks associated with nuclear war and energy and famously maintains the doomsday clock established in 1947 the foresight institute est 1986 examines the risks of nanotechnology and its benefits it was one of the earliest organizations to study the unintended consequences of otherwise harmless technology gone haywire at a global scale it was founded by k eric drexler who postulated grey goo 91 57 93 91 58 93 beginning after 2000 a growing number of scientists philosophers and tech billionaires created organizations devoted to studying global risks both inside and outside of academia 91 59 93 independent non governmental organizations ngos include the machine intelligence research institute est 2000 which aims to reduce the risk of a catastrophe caused by artificial intelligence 91 60 93 with donors including peter thiel and jed mccaleb 91 61 93 the nuclear threat initiative est 2001 seeks to reduce global threats from nuclear biological and chemical threats and containment of damage after an event 91 8 93 it maintains a nuclear material security index 91 62 93 the lifeboat foundation est 2009 funds research into preventing a technological catastrophe 91 63 93 most of the research money funds projects at universities 91 64 93 the global catastrophic risk institute est 2011 is a us based non profit non partisan think tank founded by seth baum and tony barrett gcri does research and policy work across various risks including artificial intelligence nuclear war climate change and asteroid impacts 91 65 93 the global challenges foundation est 2012 based in stockholm and founded by laszlo szombatfalvy releases a yearly report on the state of global risks 91 66 93 91 67 93 the future of life institute est 2014 works to reduce extreme large scale risks from transformative technologies as well as steer the development and use of these technologies to benefit all life through grantmaking policy advocacy in the united states european union and united nations and educational outreach 91 7 93 elon musk vitalik buterin and jaan tallinn are some of its biggest donors 91 68 93 the center on long term risk est 2016 formerly known as the foundational research institute is a british organization focused on reducing risks of astronomical suffering s risks from emerging technologies 91 69 93 university based organizations include the future of humanity institute est 2005 which researches the questions of humanity s long term future particularly existential risk 91 5 93 it was founded by nick bostrom and is based at oxford university 91 5 93 the centre for the study of existential risk est 2012 is a cambridge university based organization which studies four major technological risks artificial intelligence biotechnology global warming and warfare 91 6 93 all are man made risks as huw price explained to the afp news agency it seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology he added that when this happens we re no longer the smartest things around and will risk being at the mercy of machines that are not malicious but machines whose interests don t include us 91 70 93 stephen hawking was an acting adviser the millennium alliance for humanity and the biosphere is a stanford university based organization focusing on many issues related to global catastrophe by bringing together members of academia in the humanities 91 71 93 91 72 93 it was founded by paul ehrlich among others 91 73 93 stanford university also has the center for international security and cooperation focusing on political cooperation to reduce global catastrophic risk 91 74 93 the center for security and emerging technology was established in january 2019 at georgetown s walsh school of foreign service and will focus on policy research of emerging technologies with an initial emphasis on artificial intelligence 91 75 93 they received a grant of 55m usd from good ventures as suggested by open philanthropy 91 75 93 other risk assessment groups are based in or are part of governmental organizations the world health organization who includes a division called the global alert and response gar which monitors and responds to global epidemic crisis 91 76 93 gar helps member states with training and coordination of response to epidemics 91 77 93 the united states agency for international development usaid has its emerging pandemic threats program which aims to prevent and contain naturally generated pandemics at their source 91 78 93 the lawrence livermore
