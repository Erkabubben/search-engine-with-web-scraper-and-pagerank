edit bloomberg news was founded by michael bloomberg and matthew winkler in 1990 to deliver financial news reporting to bloomberg terminal subscribers 91 3 93 the agency was established in 1990 with a team of six people 91 4 93 winkler was first editor in chief 91 5 93 in 2010 bloomberg news included more than 2 300 editors and reporters in 72 countries and 146 news bureaus worldwide 91 6 93 91 7 93 beginnings 1990 1995 edit bloomberg business news was created to expand the services offered through the terminals according to matthew winkler then a writer for the wall street journal michael bloomberg telephoned him in november 1989 and asked what would it take to get into the news business 91 8 93 in his book the bloomberg way winkler recalls a conversation with bloomberg about a hypothetical ethical dilemma which could have arisen from bloomberg s interest in creating a newspaper you have just published a story that says the chairman and i mean chairman of your biggest customer has taken 5 million from the corporate till he is with his secretary at a rio de janeiro resort and the secretary s spurned boyfriend calls to tip you off you get an independent verification that the story is true then the phone rings the customer s public relations person says kill the story or we will return all the terminals we currently rent from you what would you do winkler asked go with the story bloomberg replied our lawyers will love the fees you generate 91 9 93 91 10 93 winkler recalls this as his deciding moment the time at which he became willing to help bloomberg build his news organization 91 9 93 91 10 93 the publication was created to provide concise timely financial news 91 11 93 as a new company in 1990 bloomberg hoped that the news service would spread the company name sell more bloomberg terminals and end bloomberg s reliance on the dow jones news services 91 3 93 the creation of bloomberg business news required winkler to open a bloomberg office in washington d c to report about political effects on the business world however the standing committee of correspondents scc in washington required bloomberg news be formally accredited to act as a legitimate news source a title that bloomberg business news only accomplished after agreeing to provide free terminals to major newspapers in exchange for news space in the publications 91 3 93 during this growth period bloomberg news opened a small television station in new york purchased new york radio station wnew launched fifteen minute weekday business news programs for broadcast on pbs and opened offices in hong kong and frankfurt germany 91 3 93 1995 2000 edit the initial goal of bloomberg business news to increase terminal sales was met by the mid 1990s and the company refocused the scope of its news service to rival the profitability of other media groups such as reuters and dow jones this led to the creation of bloomberg s magazine bloomberg personal in 1995 which was carried in the sunday edition of 18 u s papers 91 12 93 in 1994 bloomberg launched a 24 hour financial news service through bloomberg information television which was broadcast on directv bloomberg also

the bloomberg luxury lifestyle section of its paper 91 14 93 the section s content covers topics including travel wine news dining auto news gadgets technology news and more it also highlights content from bloomberg s quarterly lifestyle and luxury magazine pursuits 91 citation needed 93 2015 refocus edit in 2015 an internal memo written by editor in chief john micklethwait was leaked to the public this memo indicated an intent to refocus the agency to better target its core audience the clever customer who is short of time and better achieve the goal of being the definitive chronicle of capitalism 91 2 93 this change led to a reduction in reporting on general interest topics in favor of content related to business and economics 91 2 93 2018 redesign and paywall edit in 2018 micklethwait announced a new digital design for bloomberg news bloomberg uses a metered paywall to charge visitors for content limiting users to view 10 free articles per month with unlimited re read option and 30 minutes of bloomberg television watch per day with reset at local midnight time 91 15 93 91 16 93 michael bloomberg presidential campaign edit in november 2019 as michael bloomberg announced his presidential campaign editor in chief john micklethwait ordered his staff not to investigate their boss nor any other democratic candidates while investigations into donald trump would continue as the government of the day 91 17 93 subsequent reporting said micklethwait was referring to a team of specialized investigative reporters as opposed to the overall political team but he would not elaborate or issue a public clarification despite newsroom staff wishing for him to do so investigative journalists and political reporters operate separately but reporting indicates this distinction would not be clear to the general public 91 18 93 following bloomberg s announcement the houston chronicle dropped bloomberg as a source for the 2020 presidential campaign saying that journalists should not choose targets based on their political affiliation 91 19 93 former bloomberg news dc bureau chief megan murphy also criticized the decision saying it bars talented reporters and editors from covering massive crucial aspects of one of the defining elections of our time and calling the decision to avoid coverage not journalism 91 20 93 responding to the controversy michael bloomberg told cbs news we just have to learn to live with some things he added that his reporters get a paycheck but with your paycheck comes some restrictions and responsibilities 91 21 93 bloomberg suspended his campaign on march 4 2020 the day after super tuesday controversy edit china coverage edit bloomberg news received a 2012 george polk award for its series of stories about china s political elite revolution to riches 91 22 93 91 23 93 one story in the series focused on the family wealth of chinese leader xi jinping 91 24 93 journalist and author howard w french reported in the may june 2014 issue of the columbia journalism review that prior to publication of the xi story high level bloomberg officials met with chinese diplomats twice without informing the journalists who were working on the story 91 25 93 the first meeting was between winkler and zhang yesui the chinese ambassador to the united states zhang is said to have told winkler if bloomberg publishes this story bad things will happen for bloomberg in china if bloomberg does not publish the story good things will happen for bloomberg the second meeting occurred shortly thereafter in new york and included bloomberg chairman peter grauer the company s then chief executive daniel doctoroff and an unnamed chinese diplomat around the time of the second meeting during a lengthy conference call with bloomberg reporters and editors doctoroff insisted on changes in the story that softened its impact by revising the language used to describe the xi family s assets 91 25 93 after the xi story appeared terminal sales in china slowed because government officials ordered state enterprises not to subscribe the bloomberg news website was also blocked on chinese servers and the company was unable to get visas for journalists it wanted to send to china 91 26 93 in 2014 grauer told the staff at the bloomberg hong kong bureau that the company s sales team had done a heroic job of mending relations with chinese officials who had indicated their displeasure about the publication of the xi revelations he also warned that if bloomberg were to do anything like the xi story again the company would be straight back in the shit box 91 25 93 on october 29 2013 during a conference call winkler told four bloomberg journalists in hong kong that the findings of their major investigation into the hidden financial ties between one of the wealthiest men in china and the families of top chinese leaders would not be published less than a week later a second planned article about the children of senior chinese officials employed by foreign banks was also killed according to bloomberg employees 91 27 93 unnamed bloomberg employees quoted by the new york times said the decision not to publish was made by the company s top editors led by winkler according to one employee winkler said if we run the story we ll be kicked out of china 91 27 93 91 28 93 when contacted by the times winkler said in an email that neither story had been killed what you have is untrue he wrote the stories are active and not spiked laurie hays the senior editor on the articles echoed his statement winkler declined to discuss the conference call 91 27 93 the winkler and hays denials appeared in a story published by the times on november 8 2013 at a mayoral news conference four days later michael bloomberg also denied the accusation he insisted that bloomberg news did not do that the editors said that was just not the case noting winkler s response to the times he added no one thinks that we are wusses and not willing to stand up and write stories that are of interest to the public and that are factually correct he also said that because he was mayor of new york he was not involved in the operations of the news agency i ve recused myself from anything to do with the company he said 91 29 93 three journalists left the company after news reports about the decision appeared reporter michael forsythe editor and reporter amanda bennett and ben richardson an editor at large for asia news 91 30 93 91 31 93 forsythe was the lead writer on the xi jinping story 91 25 93 richardson said i left bloomberg because of the way the story was mishandled and because of how the company made misleading statements in the global press and senior executives disparaged the team that worked so hard to execute an incredibly demanding story he also said that the company has threatened the journalists who worked on the story with legal action if they discuss the incident publicly 91 32 93 91 28 93
