redirects here for the symbol see double turnstile logical consequence also entailment is a fundamental concept in logic which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements a valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises the philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions in what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises and what does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises 91 1 93 all of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth 91 2 93 logical consequence is necessary and formal by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation 91 1 93 a sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences for a given language if and only if using only logic i e without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true 91 3 93 logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language l displaystyle mathcal l either by constructing a deductive system for l displaystyle mathcal l or by formal intended semantics for language l displaystyle mathcal l the polish logician alfred tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment 1 the logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences 2 the relation is a priori i e it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence sense experience and 3 the logical consequence relation has a modal component 91 3 93 contents 1 formal accounts 2 a priori property of logical consequence 3 proofs and models 3 1 syntactic consequence 3 2 semantic consequence 4 modal accounts 4 1 modal formal accounts 4 2 warrant based accounts 4 3 non monotonic logical consequence 5 see also 6 notes 7 resources 8 external links formal accounts edit the most widely prevailing view on how best to account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality this is to say that whether statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure or logical form of the statements without regard to the contents of that form syntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on schemes using inference rules for instance we can express the logical form of a valid argument as all x are y all y are z therefore all x are z this argument is formally valid because every instance of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid this is in contrast to an argument like fred is mike s brother s son therefore fred is mike s nephew since this argument depends on the meanings of the words brother son and nephew the statement fred is mike s nephew is a so called material consequence of fred is mike s brother s son not a formal consequence a formal consequence must be true in all cases however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence since even the argument p is q 39 s brother s son therefore p is q 39 s nephew is valid in all cases but is not a formal argument 91 1 93 a priori property of logical consequence edit if it is known that q displaystyle q follows logically from p displaystyle p then no information about the possible interpretations of p displaystyle p or q displaystyle q will affect that knowledge our knowledge that q displaystyle q is a logical consequence of p displaystyle p cannot be influenced by empirical knowledge 91 1 93 deductively valid arguments can be known to be so without recourse to experience so they must be knowable a priori 91 1 93 however formality alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by empirical knowledge so the a priori property of logical consequence is considered to be independent of formality 91 1 93 proofs and models edit the two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of proofs and via models the study of the syntactic consequence of a logic is called its proof theory whereas the study of its semantic consequence is called its model theory 91 4 93 syntactic consequence edit see also and a formula a displaystyle a is a syntactic consequence 91 5 93 91 6 93 91 7 93 91 8 93 91 9 93 within some formal system f s displaystyle mathcal fs of a set x0393 displaystyle gamma of formulas if there is a formal proof in f s displaystyle mathcal fs of a displaystyle a from the set x0393 displaystyle gamma this is denoted x0393 x22a2 f s a displaystyle gamma vdash mathcal fs a the turnstile symbol x22a2 displaystyle vdash was originally introduced by frege in 1879 but its current use only dates back to rosser and kleene 1934 1935 91 9 93 syntactic consequence does not depend on any interpretation of the formal system 91 10 93 semantic consequence edit see also a formula a displaystyle a is a semantic consequence within some formal system f s displaystyle mathcal fs of a set of statements x0393 displaystyle gamma if and only if there is no model i displaystyle mathcal i in which all members of x0393 displaystyle gamma are true and a displaystyle a is false 91 11 93 this is denoted x0393 x22a8 f s a displaystyle gamma models mathcal fs a or in other words the set of the interpretations that make all members of x0393 displaystyle gamma true is a subset of the set of the interpretations that make a displaystyle a true modal accounts edit modal accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following basic idea x0393 displaystyle gamma x22a2 displaystyle vdash a displaystyle a is true if and only if it is necessary that if all of the elements of x0393 displaystyle gamma are true then a displaystyle a is true alternatively and most would say equivalently x0393 displaystyle gamma x22a2 displaystyle vdash a displaystyle a is true if and only if it is impossible for all of the elements of x0393 displaystyle gamma to be true and a displaystyle a false such accounts are called modal because they appeal to the modal notions of logical necessity and logical possibility it is necessary that is often expressed as a universal quantifier over possible worlds so that the accounts above translate as x0393 displaystyle gamma x22a2 displaystyle vdash a displaystyle a is true if and only if there is no possible world at which all of the elements of x0393 displaystyle gamma are true and a displaystyle a is false untrue consider the modal account in terms of the argument given as an example above all frogs are green kermit is a frog therefore kermit is green the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises because we can t imagine a possible world where a all frogs are green b kermit is a frog and c kermit is not green modal formal accounts edit modal formal accounts of logical consequence combine the modal and formal accounts above yielding variations on the following basic idea x0393 displaystyle gamma x22a2 displaystyle vdash a displaystyle a if and only if it is impossible for an argument with the same logical form as x0393 displaystyle gamma a displaystyle a to have true premises and a false conclusion warrant based accounts edit the accounts considered above are all truth preservational in that they all assume that the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from true premises to an untrue conclusion as an alternative some have proposed warrant preservational accounts according to which the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from justifiably assertible premises to a conclusion that is not justifiably assertible this is roughly the account favored by intuitionists such as michael dummett non monotonic logical consequence edit see also non monotonic logic and belief revision 160 non monotonic inference relation the accounts discussed above all yield monotonic consequence relations i e ones such that if a displaystyle a is a consequence of x0393 displaystyle gamma then a displaystyle a is a consequence of any superset of x0393 displaystyle gamma it is also possible to specify non monotonic consequence relations to capture the idea that e g tweety can fly is a logical
