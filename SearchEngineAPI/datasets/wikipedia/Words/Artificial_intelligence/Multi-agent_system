multi agent system from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search built of multiple interacting agents simple reflex agent learning agent a multi agent system mas or self organized system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents 91 1 93 multi agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve 91 2 93 intelligence may include methodic functional procedural approaches algorithmic search or reinforcement learning 91 3 93 91 4 93 despite considerable overlap a multi agent system is not always the same as an agent based model abm the goal of an abm is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents which don t necessarily need to be intelligent obeying simple rules typically in natural systems rather than in solving specific practical or engineering problems the terminology of abm tends to be used more often in the science and mas in engineering and technology 91 5 93 applications where multi agent systems research may deliver an appropriate approach include online trading 91 6 93 disaster response 91 7 93 91 8 93 target surveillance 91 9 93 and social structure modelling 91 10 93 contents 1 concept 1 1 characteristics 1 2 self organisation and self direction 1 3 system paradigms 1 4 properties 2 research 3 frameworks 4 applications 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading concept edit multi agent systems consist of agents and their environment typically multi agent systems research refers to software agents however the agents in a multi agent system could equally well be robots humans or human teams a multi agent system may contain combined human agent teams agents can be divided into types spanning simple to complex categories include passive agents 91 11 93 or agent without goals such as obstacle apple or key in any simple simulation active agents 91 11 93 with simple goals like birds in flocking or wolf sheep in prey predator model cognitive agents complex calculations agent environments can be divided into virtual discrete continuous agent environments can also be organized according to properties such as accessibility whether it is possible to gather complete information about the environment determinism whether an action causes a definite effect dynamics how many entities influence the environment in the moment discreteness whether the number of possible actions in the environment is finite episodicity whether agent actions in certain time periods influence other periods 91 12 93 and dimensionality whether spatial characteristics are important factors of the environment and the agent considers space in its decision making 91 13 93 agent actions are typically mediated via an appropriate middleware this middleware offers a first class design abstraction for multi agent systems providing means to govern resource access and agent coordination 91 14 93 characteristics edit the agents in a multi agent system have several important characteristics 91 15 93 autonomy agents at least partially independent self aware autonomous local views no agent has a full global view or the system is too complex for an agent to exploit such knowledge decentralization no agent is designated as controlling or the system is effectively reduced to a monolithic system 91 16 93 self organisation and self direction edit multi agent systems can manifest self organisation as well as self direction and other control paradigms and related complex behaviors even when the individual strategies of all their agents are simple 91 citation needed 93 when agents can share knowledge using any agreed language within the constraints of the system s communication protocol the approach may lead to a common improvement example languages are knowledge query manipulation language kqml or agent communication language acl system paradigms edit many mas are implemented in computer simulations stepping the system through discrete time steps the mas components communicate typically using a weighted request matrix e g speed very important min 45 160 mph path length medium importance max 60 expectedmax 40 max weight unimportant contract priority regular and a weighted response matrix e g speed min 50 but only if weather sunny path length 25 for sunny 46 for rainy contract priority regular note ambulance will override this priority and you ll have to wait a challenge response contract scheme is common in mas systems where first a who can question is distributed only the relevant components respond i can at this price finally a contract is set up usually in several short communication steps between sides also considering other components evolving contracts and the restriction sets of the component algorithms another paradigm commonly used with mas is the pheromone where components leave information for other nearby components these pheromones may evaporate concentrate with time that is their values may decrease or increase properties edit mas tend to find the best solution for their problems without intervention there is high similarity here to physical phenomena such as energy minimizing where physical objects tend to reach the lowest energy possible within the physically constrained world for example many of the cars entering a metropolis in the morning will be available for leaving that same metropolis in the evening the systems also tend to prevent propagation of faults self recover and be fault tolerant mainly due to the redundancy of components research edit the study of multi agent systems is concerned with the development and analysis of sophisticated ai problem solving and control architectures for both single agent and multiple agent systems 91 17 93 research topics include agent oriented software engineering beliefs desires and intentions bdi cooperation and coordination distributed constraint optimization dcops organization communication negotiation distributed problem solving multi agent learning 91 18 93 agent mining scientific communities e g on biological flocking language evolution and economics 91 19 93 91 20 93 dependability and fault tolerance robotics 91 21 93 multi robot systems mrs robotic clusters frameworks edit frameworks have emerged that implement common standards such as the fipa and omg masif 91 22 93 standards these frameworks e g jade save time and aid in the standardization of mas development 91 23 93 currently though no standard is actively maintained from fipa or omg efforts for further development of software agents in industrial context are carried out in ieee ies technical committee on industrial agents 91 24 93 applications edit mas have not only been applied in academic research but also in industry 91 25 93 mas are applied in the real world to graphical applications such as computer games agent systems have been used in films 91 26 93 it is widely advocated for use in networking and mobile technologies to achieve automatic and dynamic load balancing high scalability and self healing networks they are being used for coordinated defence systems other applications 91 27 93 include transportation 91 28 93 logistics 91 29 93 graphics manufacturing power system 91 30 93 smartgrids 91 31 93 and gis also multi agent systems artificial intelligence maai are used for simulating societies the purpose thereof being helpful in the fields of climate energy epidemiology conflict management child abuse 91 32 93 some organisations working on using multi agent system models include center for modelling social systems centre for research in social simulation centre for policy modelling society for modelling and simulation international 91 32 93 hallerbach et al discussed the application of agent based approaches for the development and validation of automated driving systems via a digital twin of the vehicle under test and microscopic traffic simulation based on independent agents 91 33 93 waymo has created a multi agent simulation environment carcraft to test algorithms for self driving cars 91 34 93 91
