large numbers from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from astronomically large jump to navigation jump to search numbers significantly larger than those used regularly for other uses see large number disambiguation large numbers are numbers significantly larger than those typically used in everyday life for instance in simple counting or in monetary transactions appearing frequently in fields such as mathematics cosmology cryptography and statistical mechanics they are typically large positive integers or more generally large positive real numbers but may also be other numbers in other contexts googology is the study of nomenclature and properties of large numbers 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 better 160 source 160 needed 93 contents 1 in the everyday world 2 astronomical 2 1 billions

logarithmic scale and orders of magnitude scientific notation was created to handle the wide range of values that occur in scientific study 1 0 109 for example means one billion or a 1 followed by nine zeros 1 000 000 000 the reciprocal 1 0 10 9 means one billionth or 0 000 000 001 writing 109 instead of nine zeros saves readers the effort and hazard of counting a long series of zeros to see how large the number is examples of large numbers describing everyday real world objects include the number of cells in the human body estimated at 3 72 1013 91 3 93 the number of bits on a computer

in astronomy and cosmology for example the current big bang model suggests that the universe is 13 8 160 billion years 4 355 1017 seconds old and that the observable universe is 93 160 billion light years across 8 8 1026 metres and contains about 5 1022 stars organized into around 125 160 billion 1 25 1011 galaxies according to hubble space telescope observations there are about 1080 atoms in the

a statistical model subject to poincar recurrence a much simplified way of thinking about this time is in a model where the universe s history repeats itself arbitrarily many times due to properties of statistical mechanics this is the time scale when it will first be somewhat similar for a reasonable choice of similar to its current state again combinatorial processes rapidly generate even larger numbers the factorial function which defines the number of permutations on a set of fixed objects grows very rapidly with the number of objects stirling s formula gives a precise asymptotic expression for this rate of growth combinatorial processes generate very large numbers in statistical mechanics these numbers are so large that they are typically only referred to using their logarithms g del numbers and similar numbers used to represent bit strings in algorithmic information theory are very large even for mathematical statements of reasonable length however some

remove this template message a standardized way of writing very large numbers allows them to be easily sorted in increasing order and one can get a good idea of how much larger a number is than another one to compare numbers in scientific notation say 5 104 and 2 105 compare the exponents first in this case 5 gt 4 so 2 105 gt 5 104 if the exponents are equal the mantissa or coefficient should be compared thus 5 104 gt 2 104 because 5 gt 2 tetration with base 10 gives the sequence 10 x2191 x2191 n 10 x2192 n x2192 2 10 x2191 n 1 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow n 10 to n to 2 10 uparrow n 1 the power towers of numbers 10 where 10 x2191 n displaystyle 10 uparrow n denotes a functional power of the function f n 10 n displaystyle f n 10 n the function also expressed by the suffix plex as in googolplex see the googol family these are very round numbers each representing an order of magnitude in a generalized sense a crude way of specifying how large a number is is specifying between which two numbers in this sequence it is more precisely numbers in between can be expressed in the form 10 x2191 n a displaystyle 10 uparrow n a i e with a power tower of 10s and a number at the top possibly in scientific notation e g 10 10 10 10 10 4 829 10 x2191 5 4 829 displaystyle 10 10 10 10 10 4 829 10 uparrow 5 4 829 a number between 10 x2191 x2191 5 displaystyle 10

displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow 65 533 and 10 x2191 x2191 65 534 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow 65 534 thus the order of magnitude of a number on a larger scale than usually meant can be characterized by the number of times n one has to take the l o g 10 displaystyle log 10 to get a number between 1 and 10 thus the number is between 10 x2191 x2191 n displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow n and 10 x2191 x2191 n 1 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow n 1 as explained a more precise description of a number also specifies the value of this number between 1 and 10 or the previous number taking the logarithm one time less between 10 and 1010 or the next between 0 and 1 note that 10 10 x2191 n x 10 x2191 n 10 x displaystyle 10 10 uparrow n x 10 uparrow n 10 x i e if a number x is too large for a representation 10 x2191 n x displaystyle 10 uparrow n x the power tower can be made one higher replacing x by log10x or find x from the lower tower representation of the log10 of the whole number if the power tower would contain one or more numbers different from 10 the two approaches would lead to different results corresponding to the fact that extending the power tower with a 10 at the bottom is then not the same as extending it with a 10 at the top but of course similar remarks apply if the whole power tower consists of copies of the same number different from 10 if the height of the tower is large the various representations for large numbers can be applied to the height itself if the height is given only approximately giving a value at the top does not make sense so the double arrow notation e g 10 x2191 x2191 7 21 x00d7 10 8 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow 7 21 times 10 8 can be used if the value after the double arrow is a very large number itself the above can recursively be applied to that value examples 10 x2191 x2191 10 10 10 3 81 x00d7 10 17 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow 10 10 10 3 81 times 10 17 between 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 2 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 2 and 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 3 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 3 10 x2191 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 10 x2191 497 9 73 x00d7 10 32 10 x2191 x2191 2 10 x2191 497 9 73 x00d7 10 32 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow 10 uparrow 497 9 73 times 10 32 10 uparrow uparrow 2 10 uparrow 497 9 73 times 10 32 between 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 4 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 4 and 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 5 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 5 similarly to the above if the exponent of 10 x2191 displaystyle 10 uparrow is not exactly given then giving a value at the right does not make sense and instead of using the power notation of 10 x2191 displaystyle 10 uparrow it is possible to add 1 displaystyle 1 to the exponent of 10 x2191 x2191 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow to obtain e g 10 x2191 x2191 3 2 8 x00d7 10 12 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow 3 2 8 times 10 12 if the exponent of 10 x2191 x2191 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow is large the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this exponent itself if this exponent is not exactly given then again giving a value at the right does not make sense and instead of using the power notation of 10 x2191 x2191 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow it is possible use the triple arrow operator e g 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 7 3 x00d7 10 6 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 7 3 times 10 6 if the right hand argument of the triple arrow operator is large the above applies to it obtaining e g 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 2 10 x2191 497 9 73 x00d7 10 32 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow 2 10 uparrow 497 9 73 times 10 32 between 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 4 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 4 and 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 5 displaystyle 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 5 this can be done recursively so it is possible to have a power of the triple arrow operator then it is possible to proceed with operators with higher numbers of arrows written x2191 n displaystyle uparrow n compare this notation with the hyper operator and the conway chained arrow notation a x2191 n b displaystyle a uparrow n b a b n hyper a 160 n 160 160 2 160 b an advantage of the first is that when considered as function of b there is a natural notation for powers of this function just like when writing out the n arrows a x2191 n k b displaystyle a uparrow n k b for example 10 x2191 2 3 b displaystyle 10 uparrow 2 3 b 10 10 10 b 2 2 2 and only in special cases the long nested chain notation is reduced for x2033 b x2033 1 displaystyle b 1 obtains 10 x2191 3 3 10 x2191 2 3 1 displaystyle 10 uparrow 3 3 10 uparrow 2 3 1 10 3 3 since the b can also be very large in general it can be written instead a number with a sequence of powers 10 x2191 n k n displaystyle 10 uparrow n k n with decreasing values of n with exactly given integer exponents k n displaystyle k n with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation whenever a k n displaystyle k n is too large to be given exactly the value of k n 1 displaystyle k n 1 is increased by 1 and everything to the right of n 1 k n 1 displaystyle n 1 k n 1 is rewritten for describing numbers approximately deviations from the decreasing order of values of n are not needed for example 10 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 5 a 10 x2191 x2191 6 a displaystyle 10 uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow 5 a 10 uparrow uparrow 6 a and 10 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 3 10 x2191 x2191 10 x2191 x2191 10 1 x2248 10 x2191 x2191 x2191 3 displaystyle 10 uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 3 10 uparrow uparrow 10 uparrow uparrow 10 1 approx 10 uparrow uparrow uparrow 3 thus is obtained the somewhat counterintuitive result that a number x can be so large that in a way x and 10x are almost equal for arithmetic of large numbers see also below if the superscript of the upward arrow is large the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this superscript itself if this superscript is not exactly given then there is no point in raising the operator to a particular power or to adjust the value on which it act instead it is possible to simply use a standard value at the right say 10 and the expression reduces to 10 x2191 n 10 10 x2192 10 x2192 n displaystyle 10 uparrow n 10 10 to 10 to n with an approximate n for such numbers the advantage of using the upward arrow notation no longer applies so the chain notation can be used instead the above can be applied recursively for this n so the notation x2191 n displaystyle uparrow n is obtained in the superscript of the first arrow etc or a nested chain notation e g 10 10 10 10 3 x00d7 10 5 displaystyle 3 times 10 5 10 x2191 10 x2191 3 x00d7 10 5 10 10 displaystyle 10 uparrow 10 uparrow 3 times 10 5 10 10 if the number of levels gets too large to be convenient a notation is used where this number of levels is written down as a number like using the superscript of the arrow instead of writing many arrows introducing a function f n 10 x2191 n 10 displaystyle f n 10 uparrow n 10 10 10 n these levels become functional powers of f allowing us to write a number in the form f m n displaystyle f m n where m is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly for example f 2 3 x00d7 10 5 displaystyle f 2 3 times 10 5 if n is large any of the above can be used for expressing it the roundest of these numbers are those of the form fm 1 10 10 m 2 for example 10 x2192 10 x2192 3 x2192 2 10 x2191 10 x2191 10 10 10 10 displaystyle 10 to 10 to 3 to 2 10 uparrow 10 uparrow 10 10 10 10 compare the definition of graham s number it uses numbers 3 instead of 10 and has 64 arrow levels and the number 4 at the top thus g lt 3 x2192 3 x2192 65 x2192 2 lt 10 x2192 10 x2192 65 x2192 2 f 65 1 displaystyle g lt 3 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 65 rightarrow 2 lt 10 to 10 to 65 to 2 f 65 1 but also g lt f 64 4 lt f 65 1 displaystyle g lt f 64 4 lt f 65 1 if m in f m n displaystyle f m n is too large to give exactly it is possible to use a fixed n e g n 1 and apply the above recursively to m i e the number of levels of upward arrows is itself represented in the superscripted upward arrow notation etc using the functional power notation of f this gives multiple levels of f introducing a function g n f n 1 displaystyle g n f n 1 these levels become functional powers of g allowing us to write a number in the form g m n displaystyle g m n where m is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly for example if 10 10 m 3 gm 1 if n is large any of the above can be used for expressing it similarly a function h etc can be introduced if many such functions are required they can be numbered instead of using a new letter every time e g as a subscript such that there are numbers of the form f k m n displaystyle f k m n where k and m are given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly using k 1 for the f above k 2 for g etc obtains 10 10 n k f k n f k x2212 1 n 1 displaystyle f k n f k 1 n 1 if n is large any of the above can be used to express it thus is obtained a nesting of forms f k m k displaystyle f k m k where going inward the k decreases and with as inner argument a sequence of powers 10 x2191 n p n displaystyle 10 uparrow n p n with decreasing values of n where all these numbers are exactly given integers with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation when k is too large to be given exactly the number concerned can be expressed as f n 10 displaystyle f n 10 10 10 10 n with an approximate n note that the process of going from the sequence 10 n displaystyle 10 n 10 n to the sequence 10 x2191 n 10 displaystyle 10 uparrow n 10 10 10 n is very similar to going from the latter to the sequence f n 10 displaystyle f n 10 10 10 10 n it is the general process of adding an element 10 to the chain in the chain notation this process can be repeated again see also the previous section numbering the subsequent versions of this function a number can be described using functions f q k m q k displaystyle f qk m qk nested in lexicographical order with q the most significant number but with decreasing order for q and for k as inner argument yields a sequence of powers 10 x2191 n p n displaystyle 10 uparrow n p n with decreasing values of n where all these numbers are exactly given integers with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation for a number too large to write down in the conway chained arrow notation it size can be described by the length of that chain for example only using elements 10 in the chain in other words one could specify its position in the sequence 10 10 10 10 10 10 if even the position in the sequence is a large number same techniques can be applied again examples edit numbers expressible in decimal notation 22 4 222 2 3 16 33 27 44 256 55 3 125 66 46 656 2 2 2 2

a large error in a large number may be relatively small and therefore acceptable for very large numbers edit in the case of an approximation of an extremely large number the relative error may be large yet there may still be a sense in which one wants to consider the numbers as close in magnitude for example consider 10 10 displaystyle 10 10 and 10 9 displaystyle 10 9 the relative error is 1

logarithms to base 10 are 10 and 9 so the relative error in the logarithms is only 10 the point is that exponential functions magnify relative errors greatly if a and b have a small relative error 10 a displaystyle 10 a and 10 b displaystyle 10 b the relative error is larger and 10 10 a displaystyle 10 10 a and 10 10 b displaystyle 10 10 b will have an even larger relative error the question then becomes on which level of iterated logarithms do to compare two numbers there is a sense in which one may want to consider 10 10 10 displaystyle 10 10 10 and 10 10 9 displaystyle 10 10 9 to be close in magnitude the relative error between these two numbers is large and the relative error between their logarithms is still large however the relative error in their second iterated logarithms is

are common e g in analytic number theory classes edit one solution to the problem of comparing large numbers is to define classes of numbers such as the system devised by robert munafo 91 12 93 which is based on different levels of perception of an average person class 0 numbers between zero and six is defined to contain numbers that are easily subitized that is numbers that show up very frequently in daily life and are almost instantly comparable class 1 numbers between six and 1 000 000 106 is defined to contain numbers whose decimal expressions are easily subitized that is numbers who are easily comparable not by cardinality but at a glance given the decimal expansion each class after these are defined in terms of iterating this base 10 exponentiation to simulate the effect of another iteration of human indistinguishibility for example class 5 is defined to include numbers between 101010106 and 10101010106 which are numbers where x becomes humanly indistinguishable from x2 91 13 93 taking iterated logarithms of such x yields indistinguishibility firstly between log x and 2log x secondly between log log x and 1 log log x and finally an extremely long decimal expansion whose length can t be subitized approximate arithmetic edit there are some general rules relating to the usual arithmetic operations performed on very large numbers the sum and the product of two very
