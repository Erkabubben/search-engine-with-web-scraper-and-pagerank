aided human translation or interactive translation is a sub field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another on a basic level mt performs mechanical substitution of words in one language for words in another but that alone rarely produces a good translation because recognition of whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language is needed not all words in one language have equivalent words in another language and many words have more than one meaning solving this problem with corpus statistical and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations handling differences in linguistic typology translation of idioms and the isolation of anomalies 91 2 93 91 failed verification 93 current machine translation software often allows for customization by domain or profession such as weather reports improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions this technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used it follows that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than machine translation of conversation or less standardised text improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention for example some systems are able to translate more accurately if the user has unambiguously identified which words in the text are proper names with the assistance of these techniques mt has proven useful as a tool to assist human translators and in a very limited number of cases can even produce output that can be used as is e g weather reports the progress and potential of machine translation have been much debated through its history since the 1950s a number of scholars first and most notably yehoshua bar hillel 91 3 93 have questioned the possibility of achieving fully automatic machine translation of high quality 91 4 93 contents 1

external links history edit main article history of machine translation origins edit the origins of machine translation can be traced back to the work of al kindi a ninth century arabic cryptographer who developed techniques for systemic language translation including cryptanalysis frequency analysis and probability and statistics which are used in modern machine translation 91 5 93 the idea of machine translation later appeared in the 17th century in 1629 ren descartes proposed a universal language with equivalent ideas in different tongues sharing one symbol 91 6 93 the idea of using digital computers for translation of natural languages was proposed as early as 1946 by england s a d booth and warren weaver at rockefeller foundation at the same time the memorandum written by warren weaver in 1949 is perhaps the single most influential publication in the earliest days of machine translation 91 7 93 91 8 93 others followed a demonstration was made in 1954 on the apexc machine at birkbeck college university of london of a rudimentary translation of english into french several papers on the topic were published at the time and even articles in popular journals for example an article by cleave and zacharov in the september 1955 issue of wireless world a similar application also pioneered at birkbeck college at the time was reading and composing braille texts by computer 1950s edit the first researcher in the field yehoshua bar hillel began his research at mit 1951 a georgetown university mt research team led by professor michael zarechnak followed 1951 with a public demonstration of its georgetown ibm experiment system in 1954 mt research programs popped up in japan 91 9 93 91 10 93 and russia 1955 and the first mt conference was held in london 1956 91 11 93 91 12 93 david g hays wrote about computer assisted language processing as early as 1957 and was project leader on computational linguistics at rand from 1955 to 1968 91 13 93 1960 1975 edit researchers continued to join the field as the association for machine translation and computational linguistics was formed in the u s 1962 and the national academy of sciences formed the automatic language processing advisory committee alpac to study mt 1964 real progress was much slower however and after the alpac report 1966 which found that the ten year long research had failed to fulfill expectations funding was greatly reduced 91 14 93 according to a 1972 report by the director of defense research and engineering ddr amp e the feasibility of large scale mt was reestablished by the success of the logos mt system in translating military manuals into vietnamese during that conflict the french textile institute also used mt to translate abstracts from and into french english german and spanish 1970 brigham young university started a project to translate mormon texts by automated translation 1971 1975 and beyond edit systran which pioneered the field under contracts from the u s government 91 1 93 in the 1960s was used by xerox to translate technical manuals 1978 beginning in the late 1980s as computational power increased and became less expensive more interest was shown in statistical models for machine translation mt became more popular after the advent of computers 91 15 93 systran s first implementation system was implemented in 1988 by the online service of the french postal service called minitel 91 16 93 various computer based translation companies were also launched including trados 1984 which was the first to develop and market translation memory technology 1989 though this is not the same as mt the first commercial mt system for russian english german ukrainian was developed at kharkov state university 1991 by 1998 for as little as 29 95 one could buy a program for translating in one direction between english and a major european language of your choice to run on a pc 91 1 93 mt on the web started with systran offering free translation of small texts 1996 and then providing this via altavista babelfish 91 1 93 which racked up 500 000 requests a day 1997 91 17 93 the second free translation service on the web was lernout amp hauspie s globalink 91 1 93 atlantic magazine wrote in 1998 that systran s babelfish and globalink s comprende handled don t bank on it with a competent performance 91 18 93 franz josef och the future head of translation development at google won darpa s speed mt competition 2003 91 19 93 more innovations during this time included moses the open source statistical mt engine 2007 a text sms translation service for mobiles in japan 2008 and a mobile phone with built in speech to speech translation functionality for english japanese and chinese 2009 in 2012 google announced that google translate translates roughly enough text to fill 1 million books in one day translation process edit main article translation process the human translation process may be described as decoding the meaning of the source text and re encoding this meaning in the target language behind this ostensibly simple procedure lies a complex cognitive operation to decode the meaning of the source text in its entirety the translator must interpret and analyse all the features of the text a process that requires in depth knowledge of the grammar semantics syntax idioms etc of the source language as well as the culture of its speakers the translator needs the same in depth knowledge to re encode the meaning in the target language 91 20 93 therein lies the challenge in machine translation how to program a computer that will understand a text as a person does and that will create a new text in the target language that sounds as if it has been written by a person unless aided by a knowledge base mt provides only a general though imperfect approximation of the original text getting the gist of it a process called gisting this is sufficient for many purposes including making best use of the finite and expensive time of a human translator reserved for those cases in which total accuracy is indispensable approaches edit bernard vauquois pyramid showing comparative depths of intermediary representation interlingual machine translation at the peak followed by transfer based then direct translation machine translation can use a method based on linguistic rules which means that words will be translated in a linguistic way the most suitable orally speaking words of the target language will replace the ones in the source language 91 citation needed 93 it is often argued that the success of machine translation requires the problem of natural language understanding to be solved first 91 21 93 generally rule based methods parse a text usually creating an intermediary symbolic representation from which the text in the target language is generated according to the nature of the intermediary representation an approach is described as interlingual machine translation or transfer based machine translation these methods require extensive lexicons with morphological syntactic and semantic information and large sets of rules given enough data machine translation programs often work well enough for a native speaker of one language to get the approximate meaning of what is written by the other native speaker the difficulty is getting enough data of the right kind to support the particular method for example the large multilingual corpus of data needed for statistical methods to work is not necessary for the grammar based methods but then the grammar methods need a skilled linguist to carefully design the grammar that they use to translate between closely related languages the technique referred to as rule based machine translation may be used rule based edit main article rule based machine translation the rule based machine translation paradigm includes transfer based machine translation interlingual machine translation and dictionary based machine translation paradigms this type of translation is used mostly in the creation of dictionaries and grammar programs unlike other methods rbmt involves more information about the linguistics of the source and target languages using the morphological and syntactic rules and semantic analysis of both languages the basic approach involves linking the structure of the input sentence with the structure of the output sentence using a parser and an analyzer for the source language a generator for the target language and a transfer lexicon for the actual translation rbmt s biggest downfall is that everything must be made explicit orthographical variation and erroneous input must be made part of the source language analyser in order to cope with it and lexical selection rules must be written for all instances of ambiguity adapting to new domains in itself is not that hard as the core grammar is the same across domains and the domain specific adjustment is limited to lexical selection adjustment transfer based machine translation edit main article transfer based machine translation transfer based machine translation is similar to interlingual machine translation in that it creates a translation from an intermediate representation that simulates the meaning of the original sentence unlike interlingual mt it depends partially on the language pair involved in the translation interlingual edit main article interlingual machine translation interlingual machine translation is one instance of rule based machine translation approaches in this approach the source language i e the text to be translated is transformed into an interlingual language i e a language neutral representation that is independent of any language the target language is then generated out of the interlingua one of the major advantages of this system is that the interlingua becomes more valuable as the number of target languages it can be turned into increases however the only interlingual machine translation system that has been made operational at the commercial level is the kant system nyberg and mitamura 1992 which is designed to translate caterpillar technical english cte into other languages dictionary based edit main article dictionary based machine translation machine translation can use a method based on dictionary entries which means that the words will be translated as they are by a dictionary statistical edit main article statistical machine translation statistical machine translation tries to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual text corpora such as the canadian hansard corpus the english french record of the canadian parliament and europarl the record of the european parliament where such corpora are available good results can be achieved translating similar texts but such corpora are still rare for many language pairs the first statistical machine translation software was candide from ibm google used systran for several years but switched to a statistical translation method in october 2007 91 22 93 in 2005 google improved its internal translation capabilities by using approximately 200 billion words from united nations materials to train their system translation accuracy improved 91 23 93 google translate and similar statistical translation programs work by detecting patterns in hundreds of millions of documents that have previously been translated by humans and making intelligent guesses based on the findings generally the more human translated documents available in a given language the more likely it is that the translation will be of good quality 91 24 93 newer approaches into statistical machine translation such as metis ii and presemt use minimal corpus size and instead focus on derivation of syntactic structure through pattern recognition with further development this may allow statistical machine translation to operate off of a monolingual text corpus 91 25 93 smt s biggest downfall includes it being dependent upon huge amounts of parallel texts its problems with morphology rich languages especially with translating into such languages and its inability to correct singleton errors example based edit main article example based machine translation example based machine translation ebmt approach was proposed by makoto nagao in 1984 91 26 93 91 27 93 example based machine translation is based on the idea of analogy in this approach the corpus that is used is one that contains texts that have already been translated given a sentence that is to be translated sentences from this corpus are selected that contain similar sub sentential components 91 28 93 the similar sentences are then used to translate the sub sentential components of the original sentence into the target language and these phrases are put together to form a complete translation hybrid mt edit main article hybrid machine translation hybrid machine translation hmt leverages the strengths of statistical and rule based translation methodologies 91 29 93 several mt organizations claim a hybrid approach that uses both rules and statistics the approaches differ in a number of ways rules post processed by statistics translations are performed using a rules based engine statistics are then used in an attempt to adjust correct the output from the rules engine statistics guided by rules rules are used to pre process data in an attempt to better guide the statistical engine rules are also used to post process the statistical output to perform functions such as normalization this approach has a lot more power flexibility and control when translating it also provides extensive control over the way in which the content is processed during both pre translation e g markup of content and non translatable terms and post translation e g post translation corrections and adjustments more recently with the advent of neural mt a new version of hybrid machine translation is emerging that combines the benefits of rules statistical and neural machine translation the approach allows benefitting from pre and post processing in a rule guided workflow as well as benefitting from nmt and smt the downside is the inherent complexity which makes the approach suitable only for specific use cases neural mt edit main article neural machine translation a deep learning based approach to mt neural machine translation has made rapid progress in recent years and google has announced its translation services are now using this technology in preference over its previous statistical methods 91 30 93 a microsoft team claimed to have reached human parity on wmt 2017 emnlp 2017 second conference on machine translation in 2018 marking a historical milestone 91 31 93 91 32 93 however many researchers have criticized this claim rerunning and discussing their experiments current consensus is that the so called human parity achieved is not real being based wholly on limited domains language pairs and certain test suites 91 33 93 i e it lacks statistical significance power 91 34 93 there is still a long journey before nmt reaches real human parity performances to address the idiomatic phrase translation multi word expressions 91 35 93 and low frequency words also called oov or out of vocabulary word translation language focused linguistic features have been explored in state of the art neural machine translation nmt models for instance the chinese character decompositions into radicals and strokes 91 36 93 91 37 93 have proven to be helpful for translating multi word expressions in nmt major issues edit machine translation could produce some non understandable phrases such as macrolepiota albuminosa being rendered as wikipedia broken chinese from machine translation in bali indonesia the broken chinese sentence sounds like there does not exist an entry or have not entered yet disambiguation edit main articles word sense disambiguation and syntactic disambiguation word sense disambiguation concerns finding a suitable translation when a word can have more than one meaning the problem was first raised in the 1950s by yehoshua bar hillel 91 38 93 he pointed out that without a universal encyclopedia a machine would never be able to distinguish between the two meanings of a word 91 39 93 today there are numerous approaches designed to overcome this problem they can be approximately divided into shallow approaches and deep approaches shallow approaches assume no knowledge of the text they simply apply statistical methods to the words surrounding the ambiguous word deep approaches presume a comprehensive knowledge of the word so far shallow approaches have been more successful 91 40 93 claude piron a long time translator for the united nations and the world health organization wrote that machine translation at its best automates the easier part of a translator s job the harder and more time consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved why does a translator need a whole workday to translate five pages and not an hour or two about 90 of an average text corresponds to these simple conditions but unfortunately there s the other 10 it s that part that requires six more hours of work there are ambiguities one has to resolve for instance the author of the source text an australian physician cited the example of an epidemic which was declared during world war ii in a japanese prisoners of war camp was he talking about an american camp with japanese prisoners or a japanese camp with american prisoners the english has two senses it s necessary therefore to do research maybe to the extent of a phone call to australia 91 41 93 the ideal deep approach would require the translation software to do all the research necessary for this kind of disambiguation on its own but this would require a higher degree of ai than has yet been attained a shallow approach which simply guessed at the sense of the ambiguous english phrase that piron mentions based perhaps on which kind of prisoner of war camp is more often mentioned in a given corpus would have a reasonable chance of guessing wrong fairly often a shallow approach that involves ask the user about each ambiguity would by piron s estimate only automate about 25 of a professional translator s job leaving the harder 75 still to be done by a human non standard speech edit one of the major pitfalls of mt is its inability to translate non standard language with the same accuracy as standard language heuristic or statistical based mt takes input from various sources in standard form of a language rule based translation by nature does not include common non standard usages this causes errors in translation from a vernacular source or into colloquial language limitations on translation from casual speech present issues in the use of machine translation in mobile devices named entities edit main article named entity in information extraction named entities in a narrow sense refer to concrete or abstract entities in the real world such as people organizations companies and places that have a proper name george washington chicago microsoft it also refers to expressions of time space and quantity such as 1 july 2011 500 in the sentence smith is the president of fabrionix both smith and fabrionix are named entities and can be further qualified via first name or other information president is not since smith could have earlier held another position at fabrionix e g vice president the term rigid designator is what defines these usages for analysis in statistical machine translation named entities must first be identified in the text if not they may be erroneously translated as common nouns which would most likely not affect the bleu rating of the translation but would change the text s human readability 91 42 93 they may be omitted from the output translation which would also have implications for the text s readability and message transliteration includes finding the letters in the target language that most closely correspond to the name in the source language this however has been cited as sometimes worsening the quality of translation 91 43 93 for southern california the first word should be translated directly while the second word should be transliterated machines often transliterate both because they treated them as one entity words like these are hard for machine translators even those with a transliteration component to process use of a do not translate list which has the same end goal transliteration as opposed to translation 91 44 93 still relies on correct identification of named entities a third approach is a class based model named entities are replaced with a token to represent their class ted and erica would both be replaced with person class token then the statistical distribution and use of person names in general can be analyzed instead of looking at the distributions of ted and erica individually so that the probability of a given name in a specific language will not affect the assigned probability of a translation a study by stanford on improving this area of translation gives the examples that different probabilities will be assigned to david is going for a walk and ankit is going for a walk for english as a target language due to the different number of occurrences for each name in the training data a frustrating outcome of the same study by stanford and other attempts to improve named recognition translation is that many times a decrease in the bleu scores for translation will result from the inclusion of methods for named entity translation 91 44 93 somewhat related are the phrases drinking tea with milk vs drinking tea with molly translation from multiparallel sources edit some work has been done in the utilization of multiparallel corpora that is a body of text that has been translated into 3 or more languages using these methods a text that has been translated into 2 or more languages may be utilized in combination to provide a more accurate translation into a third language compared with if just one of those source languages were used alone 91 45 93 91 46 93 91 47 93 ontologies in mt edit an ontology is a formal representation of knowledge that includes the concepts such as objects processes etc in a domain and some relations between them if the stored information is of linguistic nature one can speak of a lexicon 91 48 93 in nlp ontologies can be used as a source of knowledge for machine translation systems with access to a large knowledge base systems can be enabled to resolve many especially lexical ambiguities on their own in the following classic examples as humans we are able to interpret the prepositional phrase according to the context because we use our world knowledge stored in our lexicons i saw a man star molecule with a microscope telescope binoculars 91 48 93 a machine translation system initially would not be able to differentiate between the meanings because syntax does not change with a large enough ontology as a source of knowledge however the possible interpretations of ambiguous words in a specific context can be reduced other areas of usage for ontologies within nlp include information retrieval information extraction and text summarization 91 48 93 building ontologies edit the ontology generated for the pangloss knowledge based machine translation system in 1993 may serve as an example of how an ontology for nlp purposes can be compiled 91 49 93 91 50 93 a large scale ontology is necessary to help parsing in the active modules of the machine translation system in the pangloss example about 50 000 nodes were intended to be subsumed under the smaller manually built upper abstract region of the ontology because of its size it had to be created automatically the goal was to merge the two resources ldoce online and wordnet to combine the benefits of both concise definitions from longman and semantic relations allowing for semi automatic taxonomization to the ontology from wordnet a definition match algorithm was created to automatically merge the correct meanings of ambiguous words between the two online resources based on the words that the definitions of those meanings have in common in ldoce and wordnet using a similarity matrix the algorithm delivered matches between meanings including a confidence factor this algorithm alone however did not match all meanings correctly on its own a second hierarchy match algorithm was therefore created which uses the taxonomic hierarchies found in wordnet deep hierarchies and partially in ldoce flat hierarchies this works by first matching unambiguous meanings then limiting the search space to only the respective ancestors and descendants of those matched meanings thus the algorithm matched locally unambiguous meanings for instance while the word seal as such is ambiguous there is only one meaning of seal in the animal subhierarchy both algorithms complemented each other and helped constructing a large scale ontology for the machine translation system the wordnet hierarchies coupled with the matching definitions of ldoce were subordinated to the ontology s upper region as a result the pangloss mt system was able to make use of this knowledge base mainly in its generation element applications edit while no system provides the holy grail of fully automatic high quality machine translation of unrestricted text many fully automated systems produce reasonable output 91 51 93 91 52 93 91 53 93 the quality of machine translation is substantially improved if the domain is restricted and controlled 91 54 93 despite their inherent limitations mt programs are used around the world probably the largest institutional user is the european commission the molto project for example coordinated by the university of gothenburg received more than 2 375 million euros project support from the eu to create a reliable translation tool that covers a majority of the eu languages 91 55 93 the further development of mt systems comes at a time when budget cuts in human translation may increase the eu s dependency on reliable mt programs 91 56 93 the european commission contributed 3 072 million euros via its isa programme for the creation of mt ec a statistical machine translation program tailored to the administrative needs of the eu to replace a previous rule based machine translation system 91 57 93 in 2005 google claimed that promising results were obtained using a proprietary statistical machine translation engine 91 58 93 the statistical translation engine used in the google language tools for arabic lt gt english and chinese lt gt english had an overall score of 0 4281 over the runner up ibm s bleu 4 score of 0 3954 summer 2006 in tests conducted by the national institute for standards and technology 91 59 93 91 60 93 91 61 93 with the recent focus on terrorism the military sources in the united states have been investing significant amounts of money in natural language engineering in q tel 91 62 93 a venture capital fund largely funded by the us intelligence community to stimulate new technologies through private sector entrepreneurs brought up companies like language weaver currently the military community is interested in translation and processing of languages like arabic pashto and dari 91 citation needed 93 within these languages the focus is on key phrases and quick communication between military members and civilians through the use of mobile phone apps 91 63 93 the information processing technology office in darpa hosts programs like tides and babylon translator us air force has awarded a 1 million contract to develop a language translation technology 91 64 93 the notable rise of social networking on the web in recent years has created yet another niche for the application of machine translation software in utilities such as facebook or instant messaging clients such as skype googletalk msn messenger etc allowing users speaking different languages to communicate with each other machine translation applications have also been released for most mobile devices including mobile telephones pocket pcs pdas etc due to their portability such instruments have come to be designated as mobile translation tools enabling mobile business networking between partners speaking different languages or facilitating both foreign language learning and unaccompanied traveling to foreign countries without the need of the intermediation of a human translator despite being labelled as an unworthy competitor to human translation in 1966 by the automated language processing advisory committee put together by the united states government 91 65 93 the quality of machine translation has now been improved to such levels that its application in online collaboration and in the medical field are being investigated the application of this technology in medical settings where human translators are absent is another topic of research but difficulties arise due to the importance of accurate translations in medical diagnoses 91 66 93 flaws in machine translation have also been noted for their entertainment value two videos uploaded to youtube in april 2017 involve two japanese hiragana characters e and gu being repeatedly pasted into google translate with the resulting translations quickly degrading into nonsensical phrases such as decearing egg and deep sea squeeze trees which are then read in increasingly absurd voices 91 67 93 91 68 93 the full length version of the video currently has 6 9 million views as of march 2022 91 69 93 evaluation edit main article evaluation of machine translation there are many factors that affect how machine translation systems are evaluated these factors include the intended use of the translation the nature of the machine translation software and the nature of the translation process different programs may work well for different purposes for example statistical machine translation smt typically outperforms example based machine translation ebmt but researchers found that when evaluating english to french translation ebmt performs better 91 70 93 the same concept applies for technical documents which can be more easily translated by smt because of their formal language in certain applications however e g product descriptions written in a controlled language a dictionary based machine translation system has produced satisfactory translations that require no human intervention save for quality inspection 91 71 93 there are various means for evaluating the output quality of machine translation systems the oldest is the use of human judges 91 72 93 to assess a translation s quality even though human evaluation is time consuming it is still the most reliable method to compare different systems such as rule based and statistical systems 91 73 93 automated means of evaluation include bleu nist meteor and lepor 91 74 93 relying exclusively on unedited machine translation ignores the fact that communication in human language is context embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability it is certainly true that even purely human generated translations are prone to error therefore to ensure that a machine generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable quality translation is achieved such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human 91 75 93 the late claude piron wrote that machine translation at its best automates the easier part of a translator s job the harder and more time consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve ambiguities in the source text which the grammatical and lexical exigencies of the target language require to be resolved such research is a necessary prelude to the pre editing necessary in order to provide input for machine translation software such that the output will not be meaningless 91 76 93 in addition to disambiguation problems decreased accuracy can occur due to varying levels of training data for machine translating programs both example based and statistical machine translation rely on a vast array of real example sentences as a base for translation and when too many or too few sentences are analyzed accuracy is jeopardized researchers found that when a program is trained on 203 529 sentence pairings accuracy actually decreases 91 70 93 the optimal level of training data seems to be just over 100 000 sentences possibly because as training data increases the number of possible sentences increases making it harder to find an exact translation match using machine translation as a teaching tool edit although there have been concerns about machine translation s accuracy dr ana nino of the university of manchester has researched some of the advantages in utilizing machine translation in the classroom one such pedagogical method is called using mt as a bad model 91 77 93 mt as a bad model forces the language learner to identify inconsistencies or incorrect aspects of a translation in turn the individual will hopefully possess a better grasp of the language dr nino cites that this teaching tool was implemented in the late 1980s at the end of various semesters dr nino was able to obtain survey results from students who had used mt as a bad model as well as other models overwhelmingly students felt that they had observed improved comprehension lexical retrieval and increased confidence in their target language 91 77 93 machine translation and signed languages edit main article machine translation of sign languages in the early 2000s options for machine translation between spoken and signed languages were severely limited it was a common belief that deaf individuals could use traditional translators however stress intonation pitch and timing are conveyed much differently in spoken languages compared to signed languages therefore a deaf individual may misinterpret or become confused about the meaning of written text that is based on a spoken language 91 78 93 researchers zhao et al 2000 developed a prototype called team translation from english to asl by machine that completed english to american sign language asl translations the program would first analyze the syntactic grammatical and morphological aspects of the english text following this step the program accessed a sign synthesizer which acted as a dictionary for asl this synthesizer housed the process one must follow to complete asl signs as well as the meanings of these signs once the entire text is analyzed and the signs necessary to complete the translation are located in the synthesizer a computer generated human appeared and would use asl to sign the english text to the user 91 78 93 copyright edit only works that are original are subject to copyright protection so some scholars claim that machine translation results are not entitled to copyright protection because mt does not involve creativity 91 79 93 the copyright at issue is for a derivative work the author of the original work in the original language does not lose his rights when a work is translated a translator must have permission to publish a translation see also edit ai complete cache language model
