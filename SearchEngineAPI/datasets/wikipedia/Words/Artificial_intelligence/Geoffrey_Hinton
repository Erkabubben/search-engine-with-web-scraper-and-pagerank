hinton cc 32 frs 32 frsc 91 11 93 born 6 december 1947 is a british canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist most noted for his work on artificial neural networks since 2013 he has divided his time working for google google brain and the university of toronto in 2017 he co founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the vector institute in toronto 91 12 93 91 13 93 with david rumelhart and ronald j williams hinton was co author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi layer neural networks 91 14 93 although they were not the first to propose the approach 91 15 93 hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community 91 16 93 91 17 93 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 the dramatic image recognition milestone of the alexnet designed in collaboration with his students alex krizhevsky 91 21 93 and ilya sutskever for the imagenet challenge 2012 91 22 93 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision 91 23 93 hinton received the 2018 turing award together with yoshua bengio and yann lecun for their work on deep learning 91 24 93 they are sometimes referred to as the godfathers of ai and godfathers of deep learning 91 25 93 91 26 93 and have continued to give public talks together 91 27 93 91 28 93 contents 1 education 2 career and research 2 1 honours and awards 3 personal life 3 1 views 4 references education edit hinton was educated at king s college cambridge graduating in 1970 with a bachelor of arts in experimental psychology 91 1 93 he continued his study at the university of edinburgh where he was awarded a ph d in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by christopher longuet higgins 91 3 93 91 29 93 career and research edit after his ph d he worked at the university of sussex and after difficulty finding funding in britain 91 30 93 the university of california san diego and carnegie mellon university 91 1 93 he was the founding director of the gatsby charitable foundation computational neuroscience unit at university college london 91 1 93 and is currently 91 update 93 91 31 93 a professor in the computer science department at the university of toronto he holds a canada research chair in machine learning and is currently an advisor for the learning in machines amp brains program at the canadian institute for advanced research hinton taught a free online course on neural networks on the education platform coursera in 2012 91 32 93 hinton joined google in march 2013 when his company dnnresearch inc was acquired he is planning to divide his time between his university research and his work at google 91 33 93 hinton s research investigates ways of using neural networks for machine learning memory perception and symbol processing he has authored or co authored over 200 peer reviewed publications 91 2 93 91 34 93 at the conference on neural information processing systems neurips 2022 hinton introduced a new learning algorithm for neural networks that he calls the forward forward algorithm the idea of the new algorithm is to replace the traditional forward backward passes of backpropagation with two forward passes one with positive i e real data and the other with negative data which could be generated by the network itself 91 35 93 while hinton was a professor at carnegie mellon university 1982 1987 david e rumelhart and hinton and ronald j williams applied the backpropagation algorithm to multi layer neural networks their experiments showed that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data 91 14 93 in an interview of 2018 91 36 93 hinton said that david e rumelhart came up with the basic idea of backpropagation so it s his invention although this work was important in popularizing backpropagation it was not the first to suggest the approach 91 15 93 reverse mode automatic differentiation of which backpropagation is a special case was proposed by seppo linnainmaa in 1970 and paul werbos proposed to use it to train neural networks in 1974 91 15 93 during the same period hinton co invented boltzmann machines with david ackley and terry sejnowski 91 37 93 his other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations time delay neural network mixtures of experts helmholtz machines and product of experts in 2007 hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled unsupervised learning of image transformations 91 38 93 an accessible introduction to geoffrey hinton s research can be found in his articles in scientific american in september 1992 and october 1993 91 39 93 in october and november 2017 respectively hinton published two open access research papers 91 40 93 91 41 93 on the theme of capsule neural networks which according to hinton are finally something that works well 91 42 93 notable former phd students and postdoctoral researchers from his group include peter dayan 91 43 93 sam roweis 91 43 93 max welling 91 43 93 richard zemel 91 3 93 91 6 93 brendan frey 91 7 93 radford m neal 91 8 93 yee whye teh ruslan salakhutdinov 91 9 93 ilya sutskever 91 10 93 yann lecun 91 44 93 alex graves 91 43 93 and zoubin ghahramani honours and awards edit from left to right russ salakhutdinov richard s sutton geoffrey hinton yoshua bengio and steve jurvetson in 2016 hinton was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 1998 91 11 93 he was the first winner of the rumelhart prize in 2001 91 45 93 his certificate of election for the royal society reads geoffrey e hinton is internationally distinguished for his work on artificial neural nets especially how they can be designed to learn without the aid of a human teacher this may well be the start of autonomous intelligent brain like machines he has compared effects of brain damage with effects of losses in such a net and found striking similarities with human impairment such as for recognition of names and losses of categorization his work includes studies of mental imagery and inventing puzzles for testing originality and creative intelligence it is conceptual mathematically sophisticated and experimental he brings these skills together with striking effect to produce important work of great interest 91 46 93 in 2001 hinton was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university of edinburgh 91 47 93 he was the 2005 recipient of the ijcai award for research excellence lifetime achievement award 91 48 93 he has also been awarded the 2011 herzberg canada gold medal for science and engineering 91 49 93 in 2013 hinton was awarded an honorary doctorate from the universit de sherbrooke 91 50 93 in 2016 he was elected a foreign member of national academy of engineering for contributions to the theory and practice of artificial neural networks and their application to speech recognition and computer vision 91 51 93 he also received the 2016 ieee rse wolfson james clerk maxwell award 91 52 93 he has won the bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award 2016 in the information and communication technologies category for his pioneering and highly influential work to endow machines with the ability to learn 91 53 93 together with yann lecun and yoshua bengio hinton won the 2018 turing award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing 91 54 93 91 55 93 91 56 93 in 2018 he was awarded a companion of the order of canada 91 57 93 in 2022 he received the princess of asturias award in the category scientific research along with yann lecun yoshua bengio and demis hassabis 91 58 93 personal life edit hinton is the great great grandson of the mathematician and educator mary everest boole and her husband the logician george boole 91 59 93 whose work eventually became one of the foundations of modern computer science another great great grandfather was the surgeon and author james hinton 91 60 93 who was the father of charles howard hinton hinton s father was howard hinton 91 1 93 91 61 93 his middle name comes from another relative george everest 91 30 93 he is the nephew of the economist colin clark 91 62 93 he lost his second wife to ovarian cancer in 1994 91 63 93 views edit hinton moved from the u s to canada in part due to disillusionment with ronald reagan era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence 91 30 93 hinton has petitioned against lethal autonomous weapons regarding existential risk from artificial intelligence hinton typically declines to make predictions more than five years into the future noting that exponential progress makes the uncertainty too great 91 64 93 hinton is optimistic about ai s impact on the job market the phrase artificial general intelligence carries with it the implication that this sort of single robot is suddenly going to be smarter than you i don t think it s going to be that i think more and more of the routine things we do are going to be replaced by ai systems like the google assistant 91 65 93 hinton argues that agi won t make humans redundant rather he says it will remain for the most part myopic in its understanding of the world at least in the near future he believes that it ll continue to improve our lives in small but meaningful ways ai in the future is going to know a lot about what you re probably going to want to do and how to do it and it s going to be very helpful but it s not going to replace you he said if you took a system that was developed to be able to be very good at driving and you sent it on its first date i think it would be a disaster and for dangerous tasks currently performed by humans that s a step in the right direction according to hinton 91
