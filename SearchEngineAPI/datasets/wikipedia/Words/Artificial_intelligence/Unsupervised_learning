see also supervised learning unsupervised learning is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data the hope is that through mimicry which is an important mode of learning in people the machine is forced to build a concise representation of its world and then generate imaginative content from it in contrast to supervised learning where data is tagged by an expert e g tagged as a ball or fish unsupervised methods exhibit self organization that captures patterns as probability densities 91 1 93 or a combination of neural feature preferences encoded in the machine s weights and activations the other levels in the supervision spectrum are reinforcement learning where the machine is given only a numerical performance score as guidance and semi supervised learning where a small portion of the data is tagged contents 1 neural networks 1 1 tasks vs methods 1 2 training 1 3 energy 1 4 networks 1 5 history 1 6 specific networks 1 7 comparison of networks 2 probabilistic methods 2 1 approaches 2 2 method of moments 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading neural networks edit tasks vs methods edit tendency for a task to employ supervised vs unsupervised methods task names straddling circle boundaries is intentional it shows that the classical division of imaginative tasks left employing unsupervised methods is blurred in today s learning schemes neural network tasks are often categorized as discriminative recognition or generative imagination often but not always discriminative tasks use supervised methods and generative tasks use unsupervised see venn diagram however the separation is very hazy for example object recognition favors supervised learning but unsupervised learning can also cluster objects into groups furthermore as progress marches onward some tasks employ both methods and some tasks swing from one to another for example image recognition started off as heavily supervised but became hybrid by employing unsupervised pre training and then moved towards supervision again with the advent of dropout relu and adaptive learning rates training edit during the learning phase an unsupervised network tries to mimic the data it s given and uses the error in its mimicked output to correct itself i e correct its weights amp biases sometimes the error is expressed as a low probability that the erroneous output occurs or it might be expressed as an unstable high energy state in the network in contrast to supervised methods dominant use of backpropagation unsupervised learning also employs other methods including hopfield learning rule boltzmann learning rule contrastive divergence wake sleep variational inference maximum likelihood maximum a posteriori gibbs sampling and backpropagating reconstruction errors or hidden state reparameterizations see the table below for more details energy edit an energy function is a macroscopic measure of a network s activation state in boltzmann machines it plays the role of the cost function this analogy with physics is inspired by ludwig boltzmann s analysis of a gas macroscopic energy from the microscopic probabilities of particle motion p x221d displaystyle propto e e kt where k is the boltzmann constant and t is temperature in the rbm network the relation is p e e z 91 2 93 where p amp e vary over every possible activation pattern and z x2211 a l l p a t t e r n s displaystyle sum allpatterns e e pattern to be more precise p a e e a z where a is an activation pattern of all neurons visible and hidden hence early neural networks bear the name boltzmann machine paul smolensky calls e the harmony a network seeks low energy which is high harmony networks edit this table shows connection diagrams of various unsupervised networks the details of which will be given in the section comparison of network circles are neurons and edges between them are connection weights as network design changes features are added on to enable new capabilities or removed to make learning faster for instances neurons changes between deterministic hopfield and stochastic boltzmann to allow robust output weights are removed within a layer rbm to hasten learning or connections are allowed to become asymmetric helmholtz hopfield boltzmann rbm stacked boltzmann helmholtz autoencoder vae a network based on magnetic domains in iron with a single self connected layer it can be used as a content addressable memory network is separated into 2 layers hidden vs visible but still using symmetric 2 way weights following boltzmann s thermodynamics individual probabilities give rise to macroscopic energies restricted boltzmann machine this is a boltzmann machine where lateral connections within a layer are prohibited to make analysis tractable this network has multiple rbm s to encode a hierarchy of hidden features after a single rbm is trained another blue hidden layer see left rbm is added and the top 2 layers are trained as a red amp blue rbm thus the middle layers of an rbm acts as hidden or visible depending on the training phase it s in instead of the bidirectional symmetric connection of the stacked boltzmann machines we have separate one way connections to form a loop it does both generation and discrimination a feed forward network that aims to find a good middle layer representation of its input world this network is deterministic so it s not as robust as its successor the vae applies variational inference to the autoencoder the middle layer is a set of means amp variances for gaussian distributions the stochastic nature allows for more robust imagination than the deterministic autoencoder of the networks bearing people s names only hopfield worked directly with neural networks boltzmann and helmholtz came before artificial neural networks but their work in physics and physiology inspired the analytical methods that were used history edit 1969 perceptrons by minsky amp papert shows a perceptron without hidden layers

2005 approximate dates ai winter ii 2013 kingma rezende amp co introduced variational autoencoders as bayesian graphical probability network with neural nets as components specific networks edit here we highlight some characteristics of select networks the details of each are given in the comparison table below hopfield network ferromagnetism inspired hopfield networks a neuron correspond to an iron domain with binary magnetic moments up and down and neural connections correspond to the domain s influence on each other symmetric connections enables a global energy formulation during inference the network updates each state using the standard activation step function symmetric weights and the right energy functions guarantees convergence to a stable activation pattern asymmetric weights are difficult to analyze hopfield nets are used as content addressable memories cam boltzmann machine these are stochastic hopfield nets their state value is sampled from this pdf as follows suppose a binary neuron fires with the bernoulli probability p 1 1 3 and rests with p 0 2 3 one samples from it by taking a uniformly distributed random number y and plugging it into the inverted cumulative distribution function which in this case is the step function thresholded at 2 3 the inverse function 0 if x lt 2 3 1 if x gt 2 3 sigmoid belief net introduced by radford neal in 1992 this network applies ideas from probabilistic graphical models to neural networks a key difference is that nodes in graphical models have pre assigned meanings whereas belief net neurons features are determined after training the network is a sparsely connected directed acyclic graph composed of binary stochastic neurons the learning rule comes from maximum likelihood on p x wij x221d displaystyle propto sj si pi where pi 1 1 eweighted inputs into neuron i sj s are activations from an unbiased sample of the posterior distribution and this is problematic due to the explaining away problem raised by judea perl variational bayesian methods uses a surrogate posterior and blatantly disregard this complexity deep belief network introduced by hinton this network is a hybrid of rbm and sigmoid belief network the top 2 layers is an rbm and the second layer downwards form a sigmoid belief network one trains it by the stacked rbm method and then throw away the recognition weights below the top rbm as of 2009 3 4 layers seems to be the optimal depth 91 3 93 helmholtz machine these are early inspirations for the variational auto encoders it s 2 networks combined into one forward weights operates recognition and backward weights implements imagination it is perhaps the first network to do both helmholtz did not work in machine learning but he inspired the view of statistical inference engine whose function is to infer probable causes of sensory input 3 the stochastic binary neuron outputs a probability that its state is 0 or 1 the data input is normally not considered a layer but in the helmholtz machine generation mode the data layer receives input from the middle layer has separate weights for this purpose so it is considered a layer hence this network has 3 layers variational autoencoder these are inspired by helmholtz machines and combines probability network with neural networks an autoencoder is a 3 layer cam network where the middle layer is supposed to be some internal representation of input patterns the encoder neural network is a probability distribution q z given x and the decoder network is p x given z the weights are named phi amp theta rather than w and v as in helmholtz a cosmetic difference these 2 networks here can be fully connected or use another nn scheme comparison of networks edit hopfield boltzmann rbm stacked rbm helmholtz

requires too many iterations integer amp real valued neurons are more complicated hebbian learning art som the classical example of unsupervised learning in the study of neural networks is donald hebb s principle that is neurons that fire together wire together 91 4 93 in hebbian learning the connection is reinforced irrespective of an error but is exclusively a function of the coincidence between action potentials between the two neurons 91 5 93 a similar version that modifies synaptic weights takes into account the time between the action potentials spike timing dependent plasticity or stdp hebbian learning has been hypothesized to underlie a range of cognitive functions such as pattern recognition and experiential learning among neural network models the self organizing map som and adaptive resonance theory art are commonly used in unsupervised learning algorithms the som is a topographic organization in which nearby locations in the map represent inputs with similar properties the art model allows the number of clusters to vary with problem size and lets the user control the degree of similarity between members of the same clusters by means of a user defined constant called the vigilance parameter art networks are used for many pattern recognition tasks such as automatic target recognition and seismic signal processing 91 6 93 probabilistic methods edit two of the main methods used in unsupervised learning are principal component and cluster analysis cluster analysis is used in unsupervised learning to group or segment datasets with shared attributes in order to extrapolate algorithmic relationships 91 7 93 cluster analysis is a branch of machine learning that groups the data that has not been labelled classified or categorized instead of responding to feedback cluster analysis identifies commonalities in the data and reacts based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data this approach helps detect anomalous data points that do not fit into either group a central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics 91 8 93 though unsupervised learning encompasses many other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features it can be contrasted with supervised learning by saying that whereas supervised learning intends to infer a conditional probability distribution conditioned on the label of input data unsupervised learning intends to infer an a priori probability distribution approaches edit some of the most common algorithms used in unsupervised learning include 1 clustering 2 anomaly detection 3 approaches for learning latent variable models each approach uses several methods as follows clustering methods include hierarchical clustering 91 9 93 k means 91 10 93 mixture models dbscan and optics algorithm anomaly detection methods include local outlier factor and isolation forest approaches for learning latent variable models such as expectation maximization algorithm em method of moments and blind signal separation techniques principal component analysis independent component analysis non negative matrix factorization singular value decomposition method of moments edit one of the statistical approaches for unsupervised learning is the method of moments in the method of moments the unknown parameters of interest in the model are related to the moments of one or more random variables and thus these unknown parameters can be estimated given the moments the moments are usually estimated from samples empirically the basic moments are first and second order moments for a random vector the first order moment is the mean vector and the second order moment is the covariance matrix when the mean is zero higher order moments are usually represented using tensors which are the generalization of matrices to higher orders as multi dimensional arrays in particular the method of moments is shown to be effective in learning the parameters of latent variable models latent variable models are statistical models where in addition to the observed variables a set of latent variables also exists which is not observed a highly practical example of latent variable models in machine learning is the topic modeling which is a statistical model for generating the words observed variables in the document based on the topic latent variable of the document in the topic modeling the words in the document are generated according to different statistical parameters when the topic of the document is changed it is shown that method of moments tensor decomposition techniques consistently recover the parameters of a large class of latent variable models under some assumptions 91 11 93 the expectation maximization algorithm em is also one of the most practical methods for learning latent variable models however it can get stuck in local optima and it is not guaranteed that the algorithm will converge to the true unknown parameters of the model in contrast for the method of moments the global convergence is guaranteed under some conditions see also edit automated machine learning cluster analysis anomaly detection
