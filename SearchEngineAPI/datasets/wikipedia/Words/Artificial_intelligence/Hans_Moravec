moravec born november 30 1948 kautzen austria is an adjunct faculty member at the robotics institute of carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh usa he is known for his work on robotics artificial intelligence and writings on the impact of technology moravec also is a futurist with many of his publications and predictions focusing on transhumanism moravec developed techniques in computer vision

science in 1971 from the university of western ontario he then earned a phd from stanford university in 1980 for a tv equipped robot which was remote controlled by a large computer the robot was able to negotiate cluttered obstacle courses another achievement in robotics was the discovery of new approaches for robot spatial representation such as 3d occupancy grids he also developed the idea of bush robots moravec was a cofounder of seegrid corporation 91 2 93 of pittsburgh pennsylvania 91 3 93 in 2003 which is a robotics company with one of its goals being to develop a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating its environment without human intervention he is also somewhat known for his work on space tethers 91 4 93 publications edit 1988 sensor fusion in certainty grids for

moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard 91 7 93 91 8 93 in that the robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species starting around 2030 2040 91 9 93 moravec also outlined the neural substitution argument in mind children 91 6 93 58 8202 109 122 8202 published 7 years before david chalmers published a similar argument in his paper absent qualia fading qualia dancing qualia which is sometimes cited as the source of the idea the neural substitution argument is that if each neuron in a conscious brain can be replaced successively by an electronic substitute with the same behavior as the neuron it replaces then a biological consciousness would be transferred seamlessly into an electronic computer thus proving that consciousness does not depend on biology and can be treated as an abstract computable process robot mere machine to transcendent mind edit in robot mere machine to transcendent mind isbn 160 0195136306 published in 1998 moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence generalizing moore s law to technologies predating the integrated circuit and extrapolating it to predict a coming mind fire of rapidly expanding superintelligence arthur c clarke wrote about this book robot is the most awesome work of controlled imagination i have ever encountered hans moravec stretched my mind until it hit the stops 91 10 93 david brin also praised the book moravec blends hard scientific practicality with a prophet s far seeing vision 91 11 93 on the other hand the book was reviewed less favorably by colin mcginn for the new york times mcginn wrote moravec writes bizarre confused incomprehensible things about consciousness as an abstraction like number and as a mere interpretation of brain activity he also loses his grip on the distinction between virtual and real reality as his speculations spiral majestically into incoherence 91 12 93 see also edit artificial general intelligence mind uploading simulated
