default logic from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from default reasoning jump to navigation jump to search default logic is a non monotonic logic proposed by raymond reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions default logic can express facts like by default something is true by contrast standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false this is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always a classical example is birds typically fly this rule can be expressed in standard logic either by all birds fly which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly or by all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and fly which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions contents 1 syntax of default logic 1 1 examples 1 2 restrictions 2 semantics of

default logic edit a default theory is a pair x27e8 w d x27e9 displaystyle langle w d rangle w is a set of logical formulas called the background theory that formalize the facts that are known for sure d is a set of default rules each one being of the form p r e r e q u i s i t e j u s t i f i c a t i o n 1 x2026 j u s t i f i c a t i o n n c o n c l u s i o n displaystyle frac mathrm prerequisite justification 1 dots mathrm justification n mathrm conclusion according to this default if we believe that prerequisite is true and each of j u s t i f i c a t i o n n displaystyle mathrm justification n is consistent with our current beliefs we are led to believe that conclusion is true the logical formulae in w and all formulae in a default were originally assumed to be first order logic formulae but they can potentially be formulae in an arbitrary formal logic the case in which they are formulae in propositional logic is one of the most studied examples edit the default rule birds typically fly is formalized by the following default d b i r d x f l i e s x f l i e s x displaystyle d left frac mathrm bird x mathrm flies x mathrm flies x right this rule means that if x is a bird and it can be assumed that it flies then we can conclude that it flies a background theory containing some facts about birds is the following one w b i r d c o n d o r b i r d p e n g u i n x00ac f l i e s p e n g u i n f l i e s b e e displaystyle w mathrm bird mathrm condor mathrm bird mathrm penguin neg mathrm flies mathrm penguin mathrm flies mathrm bee according to this default rule a condor flies because the precondition bird condor is true and the justification flies condor is not inconsistent with what is currently known on the contrary bird penguin does not allow concluding flies penguin even if the precondition of the default bird penguin is true the justification flies penguin is inconsistent with what is known from this background theory and this default bird bee cannot be concluded because the default rule only allows deriving flies x from bird x but not vice versa deriving the antecedents of an inference rule from the consequences is a form of explanation of the consequences and is the aim of abductive reasoning a common default assumption is that what is not known to be true is believed to be false this is known as the closed world assumption and is formalized in default logic using a default like the following one for every fact f x00ac f x00ac f displaystyle frac neg f neg f for example the computer language prolog uses a sort of default assumption when dealing with negation if a negative atom cannot be proved to be true then it is assumed to be false note however that prolog uses the so called negation as failure when the interpreter has to evaluate the atom x00ac f displaystyle neg f it tries to prove that f is true and conclude that x00ac f displaystyle neg f is true if it fails in default logic instead a default having x00ac f displaystyle neg f as a justification can only be applied if x00ac f displaystyle neg f is consistent with the current knowledge restrictions edit a default is categorical or prerequisite free if it has no prerequisite or equivalently its prerequisite is tautological a default is normal if it has a single justification that is equivalent to its conclusion a default is supernormal if it is both categorical and normal a default is seminormal if all its justifications entail its conclusion a default theory is called categorical normal supernormal or seminormal if all defaults it contains are categorical normal supernormal or seminormal respectively semantics of default logic edit a default rule can be applied to a theory if its precondition is entailed by the theory and its justifications are all consistent with the theory the application of a default rule leads to the addition of its consequence to the theory other default rules may then be applied to the resulting theory when the theory is such that no other default can be applied the theory is called an extension of the default theory the default rules may be applied in different order and this may lead to different extensions the nixon diamond example is a default theory with two extensions x27e8 r e p u b l i c a n x x00ac p a c i f i s t x x00ac p a c i f i s t x q u a k e r x p a c i f i s t x p a c i f i s t x r e p u b l i c a n n i x o n q u a k e r n i x o n x27e9 displaystyle left langle left frac mathrm republican x neg mathrm pacifist x neg mathrm pacifist x frac mathrm quaker x mathrm pacifist x mathrm pacifist x right left mathrm republican mathrm nixon mathrm quaker mathrm nixon right right rangle since nixon is both a republican and a quaker both defaults can be applied however applying the first default leads to the conclusion that nixon is not a pacifist which makes the second default not applicable in the same way applying the second default we obtain that nixon is a pacifist thus making the first default not applicable this particular default theory has therefore two extensions one in which pacifist nixon is true and one in which pacifist nixon is false the original semantics of default logic was based on the fixed point of a function the following is an equivalent algorithmic definition if a default contains formulae with free variables it is considered to represent the set of all defaults obtained by giving a value to all these variables a default x03b1 x03b2 1 x2026 x03b2 n x03b3 displaystyle frac alpha beta 1 ldots beta n gamma is applicable to a propositional theory t if t x22a8 x03b1 displaystyle t models alpha and all theories t x222a x03b2 i displaystyle t cup beta i are consistent the application of this default to t leads to the theory t x222a x03b3 displaystyle t cup gamma an extension can be generated by applying the following algorithm t w current theory a 0 set of defaults applied so far 160 apply a sequence of defaults while there is a default d that is not in a and is applicable to t add the consequence of d to t add d to a 160 final consistency check if for every default d in a t is consistent with all justifications of d then output t this algorithm is non deterministic as several defaults can alternatively be applied to a given theory t in the nixon diamond example the application of the first default leads to a theory to which the second default cannot be applied and vice versa as a result two extensions are generated one in which nixon is a pacifist and one in which nixon is not a pacifist the final check of consistency of the justifications of all defaults that have been applied implies that some theories do not have any extensions in particular this happens whenever this check fails for every possible sequence of applicable defaults the following default theory has no extension x27e8 a b x00ac a b x2205 x27e9 displaystyle left langle left frac a b neg a b right emptyset right rangle since a b displaystyle a b is consistent with the background theory the default can be applied thus leading to the conclusion that a b displaystyle a b is false this result however undermines the assumption that has been made for applying the first default consequently this theory has no extensions in a normal default theory all defaults are normal each default has the form x03d5 x03c8 x03c8 displaystyle frac phi psi psi a normal default theory is guaranteed to have at least one extension furthermore the extensions of a normal default theory are mutually inconsistent i e inconsistent with each other entailment edit a default theory can have zero one or more extensions entailment of a formula from a default theory can be defined in two ways skeptical a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by all its extensions credulous a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by at least one of its extensions thus the nixon diamond example theory has two extensions one in which nixon is a pacifist and one in which he is not a pacifist consequently neither pacifist nixon nor 172 pacifist nixon are skeptically entailed while both of them are credulously entailed as this example shows the credulous consequences of a default theory may be inconsistent with each other alternative default inference rules edit the following alternative inference rules for default logic are all based on the same syntax as the original system justified differs from the original one in that a default is not applied if thereby the set t becomes inconsistent with a justification of an applied default concise a default is applied only if its consequence is not already entailed by t the exact definition is more complicated than this one this is only the main idea behind it constrained a default is applied only if the set composed of the background theory the justifications of all applied defaults and the consequences of all applied defaults including this one is consistent rational similar to constrained default logic but the consequence of the default to add is not considered in the consistency check cautious defaults that can be applied but are conflicting with each other like the ones of the nixon diamond example are not applied the justified and constrained versions of the inference rule assign at least an extension to every default theory variants of default logic edit the following variants of default logic differ from the original one on both syntax and semantics assertional variants an assertion is a pair x27e8 p r 1 x2026 r n x27e9 displaystyle langle p r 1 ldots r n rangle composed of a formula and a set of formulae such a pair indicates that p is true while the formulae r 1 x2026 r n displaystyle r 1 ldots r n have been assumed consistent to prove that p is true an assertional default theory is composed of an assertional theory a set of assertional formulae called the background theory and a set of defaults defined as in the original syntax whenever a default is applied to an assertional theory the pair composed of its consequence and its set of justifications is added to the theory the following semantics use assertional theories cumulative default logic commitment to assumptions default logic quasi default logic weak extensions rather than checking whether the preconditions are valid in the theory composed of the background theory and the consequences of the applied defaults the preconditions are checked for validity in the extension that will be generated in other words the algorithm for generating extensions starts by guessing a theory and using it in place of the background theory what results from the process of extension generation is actually an extension only if it is equivalent to the theory guessed at the beginning this variant of default logic is related in principle to autoepistemic logic where a theory x25fb x x2192 x displaystyle box x rightarrow x has the model in which x is true just because assuming x25fb x displaystyle box x true the formula x25fb x x2192 x displaystyle box x rightarrow x supports the initial assumption disjunctive default logic the consequence of a default is a set of formulae instead of a single formula whenever the default is applied at least one of its consequences is nondeterministically chosen and made true priorities on defaults the relative priority of defaults can be explicitly specified among the defaults that are applicable to a theory only one of the most preferred ones can be applied some semantics of default logic do not require priorities to be explicitly specified rather more specific defaults those that are applicable in fewer cases are preferred over less specific ones statistical variant a statistical default is a default with an attached upper bound on its frequency of error in other words the default is assumed to be an incorrect inference rule in at most that fraction of times it is applied translations edit default theories can be translated into theories in other logics and vice versa the following conditions on translations have been considered consequence preserving the original and the translated theories have the same propositional consequences faithful this condition only makes sense when translating between two variants of default logic or between default logic and a logic in which a concept similar to extension exists e g models in modal logic a translation is faithful if there exists a mapping typically a bijection between the extensions or models of the original and translated theories modular a translation from default logic to another logic is modular if the defaults and the background theory can be translated separately moreover the addition of formulae to the background theory only leads to adding the new formulae to the result of the translation same alphabet the original and translated theories are built on the same alphabet polynomial the running time of the translation or the size of the generated theory are required to be polynomial in the size of the original theory translations are typically required to be faithful or at least consequence preserving while the conditions of modularity and same alphabet are sometimes ignored the translatability between propositional default logic and the following logics have been studied classical propositional logic autoepistemic logic propositional default logic restricted to seminormal theories alternative semantics of default logic circumscription translations exist or not depending on which conditions are imposed translations from propositional default logic to classical propositional logic cannot always generate a polynomially sized propositional theory unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses translations to autoepistemic logic exist or not depending on whether modularity or the use of the same alphabet is required complexity edit the computational complexity
