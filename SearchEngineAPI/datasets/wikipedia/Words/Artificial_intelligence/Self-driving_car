further reading history edit main article history of self driving cars experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems ads since at least the 1920s 91 21 93 trials began in the 1950s the first semi automated car was developed in 1977 by japan s tsukuba mechanical engineering laboratory which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer the vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour 19 160 mph with the support of an elevated rail 91 22 93 91 23 93 a landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s with carnegie mellon university s navlab 91 24 93 and alv 91 25 93 91 26 93 projects funded by the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa starting in 1984 and mercedes benz and bundeswehr university munich s eureka prometheus project in 1987 91 27 93 by 1985 the alv had demonstrated self driving speeds on two lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour 19 160 mph with obstacle avoidance added in 1986 and off road driving in day and night time conditions by 1987 91 28 93 a major milestone was achieved in 1995 with carnegie mellon university s navlab 5 completing the first autonomous coast to coast drive of the united states of the 2 849 160 mi 4 585 160 km between pittsburgh pennsylvania and san diego california 2 797 160 mi 4 501 160 km were autonomous 98 2 completed with an average speed of 63 8 160 mph 102 7 160 km h 91 29 93 91 30 93 91 31 93 91 32 93 from the 1960s through the second darpa grand challenge in 2005 automated vehicle research in the united states was primarily funded by darpa the us army and the us navy yielding incremental advances in speeds driving competence in more complex conditions controls and sensor systems 91 33 93 companies and research organizations have developed prototypes 91 27 93 91 34 93 91 35 93 91 36 93 91 37 93 91 38 93 91 39 93 91 40 93 91 41 93 the us allocated us 650 160 million in 1991 for research on the national automated highway system which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure the programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale 91 42 93 partly funded by the national automated highway system and darpa the carnegie mellon university navlab drove 4 584 kilometres 2 848 160 mi across america in 1995 4 501 kilometres 2 797 160 mi or 98 of it autonomously 91 43 93 navlab s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when delphi improved it by piloting an audi augmented with delphi technology over 5 472 kilometres 3 400 160 mi through 15 states while remaining in self driving mode 99 of the time 91 44 93 in 2015 the us states of nevada florida california virginia and michigan together with washington dc allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads 91 45 93 from 2016 to 2018 the european commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the coordination actions cartre and scout 91 46 93 moreover the strategic transport research and innovation agenda stria roadmap for connected and automated transport was published in 2019 91 47 93 in november 2017 waymo announced that it had begun testing driver less cars without a safety driver in the driver position 91 48 93 however there was still an employee in the car 91 49 93 an october 2017 report by the brookings institution found that the 80 160 billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point but that it was reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this 91 50 93 in october 2018 waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10 000 000 miles 16 000 000 160 km increasing by about 1 000 000 miles 1 600 000 kilometres per month 91 51 93 in december 2018 waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the us in phoenix arizona 91 52 93 in october 2020 waymo launched a geo fenced driver less ride hailing service in phoenix 91 53 93 91 54 93 the cars are being monitored in real time by a team of remote engineers and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene 91 55 93 91 54 93 in march 2019 ahead of the autonomous racing series roborace robocar set the guinness world record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world in pushing the limits of self driving vehicles robocar reached 282 42 160 km h 175 49 160 mph an average confirmed by the uk timing association at elvington in yorkshire uk 91 56 93 in 2020 a national transportation safety board chairman stated that no self driving cars sae level 3 were available for consumers to purchase in the us in 2020 there is not a vehicle currently available to us consumers that is self driving period every vehicle sold to us consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated if you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system you re not selling a self driving car if you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system you don t own a self driving car 91 57 93 on 5 march 2021 honda began leasing in japan a limited edition of 100 legend hybrid ex sedans equipped with the newly approved level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by japanese government to their autonomous traffic jam pilot driving technology and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road 91 14 93 91 15 93 91 58 93 91 16 93 definitions edit there is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self driving car industry various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary in 2014 such confusion has been documented in sae j3016 which states that some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation level 5 while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ads automated driving system at or above level 3 or to any vehicle equipped with such an ads terminology and safety considerations edit modern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane speed controls or emergency braking those features alone are just considered as driver assistance technologies because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input according to fortune some newer vehicles technology names such as autonodrive pilotassist full self driving or drivepilot might confuse the driver who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task 91 59 93 according to the bbc confusion between those concepts leads to deaths 91 60 93 for this reason some organizations such as the aaa try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as alks which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries the association of british insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think autonomous and autopilot mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety technology able to drive a car is still in its beta stage some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self driving when they are not able to manage some driving situations despite being called full self driving tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system 91 61 93 this makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident taking distracted driving behavior leading to crashes while in great britain a fully self driving car is only a car registered in a specific list 91 62 93 there have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics 91 63 93 according to the smmt there are two clear states a vehicle is either assisted with a driver being supported by technology or automated where the technology is effectively and safely replacing the driver 91 64 93 autonomous vs automated edit autonomous means self governing 91 65 93 many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated made automatic subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment such as magnetic strips autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention 91 65 93 one approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity for collision avoidance and farther away for congestion management such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle s autonomy while still not requiring human intervention as of 2017 91 update 93 most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime euro ncap defines autonomous in autonomous emergency braking as the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident which implies the autonomous system is not the driver 91 66 93 in europe the words automated and autonomous might be used together for instance regulation eu 2019 2144 of the european parliament and of the council of 27 november 2019 on type approval requirements for motor vehicles defines automated vehicle and fully automated vehicle based on their autonomous capacity 91 67 93 automated vehicle means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required 91 67 93 fully automated vehicle means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision 91 67 93 in british english the word automated alone might have several meaning such in the sentence thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety going on to say they cannot therefore be classed as automated driving instead it claims the tech should be classed as assisted driving 91 68 93 the first occurrence of the automated word refers to an unece automated system while the second occurrence refers to the british legal definition of an automated vehicle the british law interprets the meaning of automated vehicle based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle driving itself and an insured vehicle 91 69 93 autonomous versus cooperative edit to enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle some companies use a remote driver 91 70 93 according to sae j3016 some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self sufficiently but if they depend on communication and or cooperation with outside entities they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous classifications edit self driving car edit pc magazine defines a self driving car as a computer controlled car that drives itself 91 71 93 the union of concerned scientists states that self driving cars are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle also known as autonomous or driver less cars they combine sensors and software to control navigate and drive the vehicle 91 72 93 the british automated and electric vehicles act 2018 law defines a vehicle as driving itself if the vehicle is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled and does not need to be monitored by an individual 91 73 93 another british definition assumes self driving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves 91 74 93 sae classification edit tesla autopilot is classified as an sae level 2 system 91 75 93 91 76 93 a classification system with six levels ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems was published in 2014 by standardization body sae international as j3016 taxonomy and definitions for terms related to on road motor vehicle automated driving systems the details are revised periodically 91 13 93 this classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required rather than the vehicle s capabilities although these are loosely related in the united states in 2013 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa had released its original formal classification system after sae updated its classification in 2016 called j3016 201609 91 77 93 nhtsa adopted the sae standard 91 78 93 and sae classification became widely accepted 91 79 93 levels of driving automation edit in sae s automation level definitions driving mode means a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements e g expressway merging high speed cruising low speed traffic jam closed campus operations etc 91 1 93 91 80 93 level 0 the automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control level 1 hands on the driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed cruise control or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed adaptive cruise control or acc and parking assistance where steering is automated while speed is under manual control the driver must be ready to retake full control at any time lane keeping assistance lka type ii is a further example of level 1 self driving automatic emergency braking which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a level 1 feature according to autopilot review magazine 91 81 93 level 2 hands off the automated system takes full control of the vehicle accelerating braking and steering the driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly the shorthand hands off is not meant to be taken literally contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during sae 2 driving to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene the eyes of the driver may be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic actual hands off driving is sometimes considered level 2 5 although there are no official half levels a common example is adaptive cruise control which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle such as super cruise in the cadillac ct6 by general motors or ford s f 150 bluecruise 91 82 93 level 3 eyes off the driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks e g the driver can text or watch a film the vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response like emergency braking the driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time specified by the manufacturer when called upon by the vehicle to do so this level of automation can be thought of as a co driver or co pilot that s ready to alert the driver in an orderly fashion when swapping their turn to drive an example would be a traffic jam chauffeur 91 83 93 a car satisfying the international automated lane keeping systems alks regulations 91 84 93 level 4 mind off as level 3 but no driver attention is ever required for safety e g the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver s seat however self driving is supported only in limited spatial areas geofenced or under special circumstances outside of these areas or circumstances the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip e g slow down and park the car if the driver does not retake control an example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area at a specific time and quantities automated valet parking is another example level 5 steering wheel optional no human intervention is required at all an example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces all over the world all year around in all weather conditions in the formal sae definition below an important transition is from sae level 2 to sae level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously at sae 3 the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system at sae 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at sae 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention sae j3016 automation levels 91 80 93 sae level name narrative definition execution ofsteering

modes 5 full automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver all driving modes criticism of sae edit the sae automation levels have been criticized for their technological focus it has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better which may not always be the case 91 85 93 the sae levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure 91 86 93 and road user behavior 91 87 93 91 88 93 technology edit this section is written like a personal reflection personal essay or argumentative essay that states a wikipedia editor s personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style april 2022 learn how and when to remove this template message general perspectives edit several classifications have been proposed to deal with the broad range of technological discussions pertaining to self driving cars one such proposal is to classify based on the following categories car navigation path planning environment perception and car control 91 89 93 in the 2020s it became apparent that these technologies are far more complex than initially thought 91 90 93 91 91 93 even video games have been used as a platform to test autonomous vehicles 91 92 93 hybrid navigation edit main article hybrid navigation hybrid navigation is the simultaneous use of more than one navigation system for location data determination needed for navigation sensing to reliably and safely operate an autonomous vehicle usually a mixture of sensors is utilized 91 91 93 typical sensors include lidar light detection and ranging stereo vision gps and imu 91 93 93 91 94 93 modern self driving cars generally use bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping slam algorithms which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off line map into current location estimates and map updates 91 95 93 waymo has developed a variant of slam with detection and tracking of other moving objects datmo which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians simpler systems may use roadside real time locating system rtls technologies to aid localization maps self driving cars require a new class of high definition maps hd maps that represent the world at up to two orders of magnitude more detail 91 91 93 in may 2018 researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology mit announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads 91 96 93 researchers at their computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail have developed a new system called maplite which allows self driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before without using 3d maps the system combines the gps position of the vehicle a sparse topological map such as openstreetmap i e having 2d features of the roads only and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions 91 97 93 sensor fusion control systems on automated cars may use sensor fusion which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent accurate and useful view of the environment 91 98 93 self driving cars tend to use a combination of cameras lidar sensors and radar sensors in order to enhance performance and ensure the safety of the passenger and other drivers on the road an increased consistency in self driving performance prevents accidents that may occur because of one faulty sensor 91 99 93 path planning path planning is a computational problem to find a sequence of valid configurations that moves the object from the source to destination self driving cars rely on path planning technology in order to follow the rules of traffic and prevent accidents from occurring the large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram an occupancy grid mapping or with a driving corridors algorithm 91 100 93 a driving corridors algorithm allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open free space that is bounded by lanes or barriers while these algorithms work in a simple situation path planning has not been proven to be effective in a complex scenario two techniques used for path planning are graph based search and variational based optimization techniques graph based techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicle obstacle variational based optimization techniques require a higher level of planning in setting restrictions on the vehicle s driving corridor to prevent collisions 91 101 93 drive by wire edit main article drive by wire drive by wire technology in the automotive industry is the use of electrical or electro mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages driver monitoring system edit main article driver monitoring system driver monitoring system is a vehicle safety system to assess the driver s alertness and warn the driver if needed it is recognized in developer side that the role of the systems will increase as sae level 2 systems become more common place and becomes more challenging at level 3 and above to predict the driver s readiness for handover 91 102 93 vehicular communication edit main article vehicular communication systems vehicular communications is a growing area of communications between vehicles and including roadside communication infrastructure vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer to peer network providing each other with information this connectivity enables autonomous vehicles to interact with non autonomous traffic and pedestrians to increase safety 91 103 93 91 104 93 and autonomous vehicles will need to connect to the cloud to update their software and maps and feedback information to improve the used maps and software of their manufacturer 91 91 93 re programmable edit see also over the air programming autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner e g update in better distinguishing blind person vs non blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person a characteristic of this re programmable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier because through machine learning smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly e g new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems these reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software in march 2021 unece regulation on software update and software update management system was published 91 105 93 modularity edit autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a layered modular architecture the layered modular architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices networks services and contents into autonomous vehicles these loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces the first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer this layer consists of the following two parts logical capability and physical machinery the physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself e g chassis and carrosserie when it comes to digital technologies the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous the logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers on top of the device layer comes the network layer this layer also consists of two different parts physical transport and logical transmission the physical transport layer refers to the radars sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information next to that the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers this increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform the service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle and its owners as they extract create store and consume content with regards to their own driving history traffic congestion roads or parking abilities for example the final layer of the model is the contents layer this layer contains the sounds images and videos the autonomous vehicles store extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment the contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content s origin ownership copyright encoding methods content tags geo time stamps and so on yoo et al 2010 homogenization edit in order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information e g radar gps motion sensors and computer vision homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form this means their differences are decoupled and digital information can be transmitted stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it in international standardization field iso tc 22 is in charge of in vehicle transport information and control systems 91 106 93 and iso tc 204 is in charge of information communication and control systems in the field of urban and rural surface transportation 91 107 93 international standards have been actively developed in the domains of ad adas functions connectivity human interaction in vehicle systems management engineering dynamic map and positioning privacy and security 91 108 93 mathematical safety model edit in 2017 mobileye published a mathematical model for automated vehicle safety which is called responsibility sensitive safety rss 91 109 93 it is under standardization at ieee standards association as ieee p2846 a formal model for safety considerations in automated vehicle decision making 91 110 93 in 2022 a research group of national institute of informatics nii japan expanded rss and developed goal aware rss to make rss rules possible to deal with complex scenarios via program logic 91 111 93 challenges edit obstacles edit the potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability 91 112 93 91 113 93 the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non automated to automated 91 114 93 and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars 91 115 93 concerns about safety 91 116 93 and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self driving cars 91 117 93 in addition cyberattacks could be a potential threat to autonomous driving in the future 91 118 93 other obstacles could include de skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies 91 119 93 ethical problems where an automated vehicle s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action the trolley problem 91 120 93 91 121 93 concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern recognition ai and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds gestures and non verbal cues by police other drivers or pedestrians 91 122 93 autonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another possible technological obstacles for automated cars are 91 needs update 93 artificial intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner city environments 91 123 93 a car s computer could potentially be compromised as could a communication system between cars 91 124 93 91 125 93 91 126 93 91 127 93 91 128 93 susceptibility of the car s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather such as snow or deliberate interference including jamming and spoofing 91 122 93 avoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking and volvo found that software suited to caribou deer and elk was ineffective with kangaroos 91 129 93 autonomous cars may require high definition maps to operate properly where these maps may be out of date they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors competition for the radio spectrum desired for the car s communication 91 130 93 field programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain 91 128 93 current road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally 91 131 93 validation challenge of automated driving and need for novel simulation based approaches comprising digital twins and agent based traffic simulation 91 132 93 concerns edit regulationin the 2010s researchers openly worried about the potential of future regulation to delay deployment of automated

practice it is actually very difficult to be approved as level 3 deceptive marketing as tesla s full self driving fsd actually corresponds to level 2 91 134 93 senators called for investigation to the federal trade commission ftc about their marketing claims in august 2021 91 135 93 and in december 2021 in japan mercedes benz japan co ltd was punished by the consumer affairs agency for the descriptions in their handouts that are different from the fact 91 136 93 in july 2016 following a fatal crash by a tesla car operating in autopilot mode mercedes benz was also slammed for a misleading commercial advertising e class models which had been available with drive pilot 91 137 93 at that time mercedes benz rejected the claims and stopped its self driving car ad campaign which had been running in the united states 91 138 93 91 139 93 in august 2022 the california department of motor vehicles dmv accused tesla of deceptive marketing practices 91 140 93 employment companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand 91 141 93 as such education and training by third party organizations such as providers of online courses and self taught community driven projects such as diy robocars 91 142 93 and formula pi have quickly grown in popularity while university level extra curricular programmed such as formula student driver less 91 143 93 have bolstered graduate experience industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources such as code 91 144 93 datasets 91 145 93 and glossaries 91 146 93 to widen the recruitment pool national security in the 2020s from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation self driving car has become a topic of national security the concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection but also in the context of national security the trove of data collected by self driving cars paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities creates an appealing target for intelligence collection self driving cars are required to be considered in a new way when it comes to espionage risk 91 147 93 it was in july 2018 that a former apple engineer was arrested by federal bureau of investigation fbi at san jose international airport sjc while preparing to board a flight to china and charged with stealing proprietary information related to apple s self driving car project 91 148 93 91 149 93 and in january 2019 another apple employee was charged with stealing self driving car project secrets 91 150 93 in july 2021 united states department of justice doj accused chinese security officials of a hacking attack seeking data on of coordinating a vast hacking campaign to steal sensitive and secret information from government entities including research related to autonomous vehicles 91 151 93 91 152 93 on the china side they have already prepared the provisions on management of automotive data security trial 91 153 93 91 154 93 it is concerned that leapfrogging ability can be applied to autonomous car technology 91 155 93 also emerging cellular v2x cellular vehicle to everything technologies are based on 5g wireless networks 91 156 93 as of november 2022 91 update 93 us congress is applying fresh scrutiny to the possibility that imported chinese technology could be a trojan horse 91 157 93 human factors edit see also human factors and ergonomics moving obstacles self driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians bicyclists and animals and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms 91 10 93 human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals drive ai is testing a solution to this problem that involves led signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle announcing status such as going now don t cross vs waiting for you to cross 91 158 93 handover and risk compensation two human factor challenges are important for safety one is the handover from automated driving to manual driving human factors research on automated systems has shown that people are slow to detect a problem with automation and slow to understand the problem after it is detected when automation failures occur unexpected transitions that require a driver to take over will occur suddenly and the driver may not be ready to take over 91 159 93 the second challenge is known as risk compensation as a system is perceived to be safer instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits semi automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem for example with users of tesla autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous in the near future pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self driving cars are capable of avoiding them trust in order for people to buy self driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads the technology must be trusted as safe 91 160 93 91 161 93 self driving elevators were invented in 1900 but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button 91 162 93 91 163 93 there are three types of trust between human and automation 91 164 93 there is dispositional trust the trust between the driver and the company s product 91 164 93 there is situational trust or the trust from different scenarios 91 164 93 and there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events 91 164 93 moral issues edit see also machine ethicsrationale for liabilitythere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash especially with people being hurt 91 165 93 one study suggests requesting the owners of self driving cars to sign end user license agreements eulas assigning to them accountability for any accidents 91 166 93 other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident 91 165 93 other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles and suppliers of components of the av 91 167 93 implications from the trolley problema moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software of a self driving vehicle is captured in a variation of the traditional ethical thought experiment the trolley problem an av is driving with passengers when suddenly a person appears in its way and the car has to commit between one of two options either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall killing the passengers 91 168 93 researchers have suggested in particular two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency deontology and utilitarianism 91 10 93 91 169 93 deontological theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written out rules that it needs to follow in any situation utilitarianism on the other hand promotes maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash 91 10 93 91 169 93 recently some specific ethical frameworks i e utilitarianism deontology relativism absolutism monism and pluralism are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self driving cars in unavoidable accidents 91 170 93 according to research people overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas that is in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties 91 171 93 while people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs 91 171 93 this presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs 91 171 93 people disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers 91 171 93 bonnefon et al concluded that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety 91 171 93 this is because if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self protective cars it could prevent the large scale implementation of self driving cars 91 171 93 delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives 91 171 93 privacyprivacy related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual see data mining this information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken voice recording video recording preferences in media that is consumed in the car behavioral patterns to many more streams of

2021 91 update 93 tesla s advanced driver assistance system adas autopilot is classified as a level 2 91 216 93 on 20 january 2016 the first of five known fatal crashes of a tesla with autopilot occurred in china s hubei province 91 217 93 according to china s 163 com news channel this marked china s first accidental death due to tesla s automatic driving system initially tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on autopilot at the time however 163 com pointed out that other factors such as the car s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash and the driver s otherwise good driving record seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on autopilot at the time a similar fatal crash occurred four months later in florida 91 218 93 91 219 93 in 2018 in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and tesla tesla did not deny that the car had been on autopilot at the time of the accident and sent evidence to the victim s father documenting that fact 91 220 93 the second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in williston florida on 7 may 2016 while a tesla model s electric car was engaged in autopilot mode the occupant was killed in a crash with an 18 wheel tractor trailer on 28 june 2016 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the florida highway patrol according to nhtsa preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor trailer made a left turn in front of the tesla at an intersection on a non controlled access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes the car continued to travel after passing under the truck s trailer 91 221 93 91 222 93 nhtsa s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involved a population of an estimated 25 000 model s cars 91 223 93 on 8 july 2016 nhtsa requested tesla motors provide the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its autopilot technology the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction and tesla s planned updates schedule for the next four months 91 224 93 according to tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the model s tesla also claimed that this was tesla s first known autopilot death in over 130 160 million miles 210 160 million kilometers driven by its customers with autopilot engaged however by this statement tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the january 2016 fatality in hubei china had also been the result of an autopilot system error according to tesla there is a fatality every 94 160 million miles 151 160 million kilometers among all type of vehicles in the us 91 221 93 91 222 93 91 225 93 however this number also includes fatalities of the crashes for instance of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians 91 226 93 91 227 93 in july 2016 the us national transportation safety board ntsb opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the autopilot was engaged the ntsb is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations an agency spokesman said it s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible 91 228 93 in january 2017 the ntsb released the report that concluded tesla was not at fault the investigation revealed that for tesla cars the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after autopilot was installed 91 229 93 in 2021 ntsb chair called on tesla to change the design of its autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers according to a letter sent to the company s ceo 91

later determined that the immediate cause of the accident was the safety driver s failure to monitor the road because she was distracted by her phone however uber atg s inadequate safety culture contributed to the crash the report noted from the post mortem that the victim had a very high level of methamphetamine in her body 91 247 93 the board also called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads 91 248 93 91 249 93 in september 2020 the backup driver rafael vasquez was charged with negligent homicide because she did not look at the road for several seconds while her phone was streaming the voice broadcast by hulu she pleaded not guilty and was released to await trial uber does not face any criminal charge because in the usa there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation the safety driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident because she was in the driving seat in a capacity to avoid an
