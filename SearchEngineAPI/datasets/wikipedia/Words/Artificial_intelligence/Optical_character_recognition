understand please help improve it to make it understandable to non experts without removing the technical details september 2010 learn how and when to remove this template message video of the process of scanning and real time optical character recognition ocr with a portable scanner optical character recognition or optical character reader ocr is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed handwritten or printed text into machine encoded text whether from a scanned document a photo of a document a scene photo for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image for example from a television broadcast 91 1 93 widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records whether passport documents invoices bank statements computerized receipts business cards mail printouts of static data or any suitable documentation it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited searched stored more compactly displayed on line and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing machine translation extracted text to speech key data and text mining ocr is a field of research in pattern recognition artificial intelligence and computer vision early versions needed to be trained with images of each character and worked on one font at a time advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs 91 2 93 some systems are capable of reproducing

devices for the blind 91 3 93 in 1914 emanuel goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code 91 4 93 concurrently edmund fournier d albe developed the optophone a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters 91 5 93 in the late 1920s and into the 1930s emanuel goldberg developed what he called a statistical machine for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system in 1931 he was granted usa patent number 1 838 389 for the invention the patent was acquired by ibm blind and visually impaired users edit in 1974 ray kurzweil started the company kurzweil computer products inc and continued development of omni font ocr which could recognize text printed in virtually any font kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni font ocr but it was in use by companies including compuscan in the late 1960s and 1970s 91 3 93 91 6 93 kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud this device required the invention of two enabling technologies 160 8211 32 the ccd flatbed scanner and the text to speech synthesizer on january 13 1976 the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by kurzweil and the leaders of the national federation of the blind 91 citation needed 93 in 1978 kurzweil computer products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program lexisnexis was one of the first customers and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases two years later kurzweil sold his company to xerox which had an interest in further commercializing paper to computer text conversion xerox eventually spun it off as scansoft which merged with nuance communications in the 2000s ocr was made available online as a service webocr in a cloud computing environment and in mobile applications like real time translation of foreign language signs on a smartphone with the advent of smart phones and smartglasses ocr can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device s camera these devices that do not have ocr functionality built into the operating system will typically use an ocr api to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device 91 7 93 91 8 93 the ocr api returns the extracted text along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing such as text to speech or display various commercial and open source ocr systems are available for most common writing systems including latin cyrillic arabic hebrew indic bengali bangla devanagari tamil chinese japanese and korean characters applications edit ocr engines have been developed into many kinds of domain specific ocr applications such as receipt ocr invoice ocr check ocr legal billing document ocr they can be used for data entry for business documents e g cheque passport invoice bank statement and receipt automatic number plate recognition in airports for passport recognition and information extraction automatic insurance documents key information extraction 91 citation needed 93 traffic sign recognition 91 9 93 extracting business card information into a contact list 91 10 93 more quickly make textual versions of printed documents e g book scanning for project gutenberg make electronic images of printed documents searchable e g google books converting handwriting in real time to control a computer pen computing defeating captcha anti bot systems though these are specifically designed to prevent ocr 91 11 93 91 12 93 91 13 93 the purpose can also be to test the robustness of captcha anti bot systems assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users writing the instructions for vehicles by identifying cad images in a database that are appropriate to the vehicle design as it changes in real time making scanned documents searchable by converting them to searchable pdfs types edit optical character recognition ocr 160 8211 32 targets typewritten text one glyph or character at a time optical word recognition 160 8211 32 targets typewritten text one word at a time for languages that use a space as a word divider usually just called ocr intelligent character recognition icr 160 8211 32 also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text one glyph or character at a time usually involving machine learning intelligent word recognition iwr 160 8211 32 also targets handwritten printscript or cursive text one word at a time this is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script ocr is generally an offline process which analyses a static document there are cloud based services which provide an online ocr api service handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition 91 14 93 instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words this technique is able to capture motions such as the order in which segments are drawn the direction and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it this additional information can make the end to end process more accurate this technology is also known as on line character recognition dynamic character recognition real time character recognition and intelligent character recognition techniques edit pre processing edit ocr software often pre processes images to improve the chances of successful recognition techniques include 91 15 93 de skew 160 8211 32 if the document was not aligned properly when scanned it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical despeckle 160 8211 32 remove positive and negative spots smoothing edges binarisation 160 8211 32 convert an image from color or greyscale to black and white called a binary image because there are two colors the task of binarisation is performed as a simple way of separating the text or any other desired image component from the background 91 16 93 the task of binarisation itself is necessary since most commercial recognition algorithms work only on binary images since it proves to be simpler to do so 91 17 93 in addition the effectiveness of the binarisation step influences to a significant extent the quality of the character recognition stage and the careful decisions are made in the choice of the binarisation employed for a given input image type since the quality of the binarisation method employed to obtain the binary result depends on the type of the input image scanned document scene text image historical degraded document etc 91 18 93 91 19 93 line removal 160 8211 32 cleans up non glyph boxes and lines layout analysis or zoning 160 8211 32 identifies columns paragraphs captions etc as distinct blocks especially important in multi column layouts and tables line and word detection 160 8211 32 establishes baseline for word and character shapes separates words if necessary script recognition 160 8211 32 in multilingual documents the script may change at the level of the words and hence identification of the script is necessary before the right ocr can be invoked to handle the specific script 91 20 93 character isolation or segmentation 160 8211 32 for per character ocr multiple characters that are connected due to image artifacts must be separated single characters that are broken into multiple pieces due to artifacts must be connected normalize aspect ratio and scale 91 21 93 segmentation of fixed pitch fonts is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas for proportional fonts more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words and vertical lines can intersect more than one character 91 22 93 text recognition edit there are two basic types of core ocr algorithm which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters 91 23 93 matrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel by pixel basis it is also known as pattern matching pattern recognition or image correlation this relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale this technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered this is the technique the early physical photocell based ocr implemented rather directly feature extraction decomposes glyphs into features like lines closed loops line direction and line intersections the extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient these features are compared with an abstract vector like representation of a character which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes general techniques of feature detection in computer vision are applicable to this type of ocr which is commonly seen in intelligent handwriting recognition and indeed most modern ocr software 91 24 93 nearest neighbour classifiers such as the k nearest neighbors algorithm are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match 91 25 93 software such as cuneiform and tesseract use a two pass approach to character recognition the second pass is known as adaptive recognition and uses the letter shapes recognized with high confidence on the first pass to recognize better the remaining letters on the second pass this is advantageous for unusual fonts or low quality scans where the font is distorted e g blurred or faded 91 22 93 modern ocr software include google docs ocr abbyy finereader and transym 91 26 93 others like ocropus and tesseract uses neural networks which are trained to recognize whole lines of text instead of focusing on single characters a new technique known as iterative ocr automatically crops a document into sections based on page layout ocr is performed on the sections individually using variable character confidence level thresholds to maximize page level ocr accuracy a patent from the united states patent office has been issued for this method 91 27 93 the ocr result can be stored in the standardized alto format a dedicated xml schema maintained by the united states library of congress other common formats include hocr and page xml for a list of optical character recognition software see comparison of optical character recognition software post processing edit ocr accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a lexicon 160 8211 32 a list of words that are allowed to occur in a document 91 15 93 this might be for example all the words in the english language or a more technical lexicon for a specific field this technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon like proper nouns tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step for improved accuracy 91 22 93 the output stream may be a plain text stream or file of characters but more sophisticated ocr systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce for example an annotated pdf that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation near neighbor analysis can make use of co occurrence frequencies to correct errors by noting that certain words are often seen together 91 28 93 for example washington d c is generally far more common in english than washington doc knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun for example allowing greater accuracy the levenshtein distance algorithm has also been used in ocr post processing to further optimize results from an ocr api 91 29 93 application specific optimizations edit in recent years 91 when 93 the major ocr technology providers began to tweak ocr systems to deal more efficiently with specific types of input beyond an application specific lexicon better performance may be had by taking into account business rules standard expression 91 clarification needed 93 or rich information contained in color images this strategy is called application oriented ocr or customized ocr and has been applied to ocr of license plates invoices screenshots id cards driver licenses and automobile manufacturing the new york times has adapted the ocr technology into a proprietary tool they entitle document helper that enables their interactive news team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed they note that it enables them to process what amounts to as many as 5 400 pages per hour in preparation for reporters to review the contents 91 30 93 workarounds edit there are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved ocr algorithms forcing better input edit special fonts like ocr a ocr b or micr fonts with precisely specified sizing spacing and distinctive character shapes allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing ironically however several prominent ocr engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as arial or times new roman and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts as google tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts it can recognize ocr a ocr b and micr fonts 91 31 93 comb fields are pre printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legibly 160 8211 32 one glyph per box 91 28 93 these are often printed in a dropout color which can be easily removed by the ocr system 91 28 93 palm os used a special set of glyphs known as graffiti which are similar to printed english characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform s computationally limited hardware users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs zone based ocr restricts the image to a specific part of a document this is often referred to as template ocr crowdsourcing edit crowdsourcing humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer driven ocr but with higher accuracy for recognizing images than that obtained via computers practical systems include the amazon mechanical turk and recaptcha the national library of finland has developed an online interface for users to correct ocred texts in the standardized alto format 91 32 93 crowd sourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms for example through the use of rank order tournaments 91 33 93 accuracy edit this article needs to be updated please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information march 2013 commissioned by the u s department of energy doe the information science research institute isri had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents and it conducted the most authoritative of the annual test of ocr accuracy from 1992 to 1996 91 34 93 recognition of latin script typewritten text is still not 100 accurate even where clear imaging is available one study based on recognition of 19th and early 20th century newspaper pages concluded that character by character ocr accuracy for commercial ocr software varied from 81 to 99 91 35 93 total accuracy can be achieved by human review or data dictionary authentication other areas including recognition of hand printing cursive handwriting and printed text in other scripts especially those east asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character are still the subject of active research the mnist database is commonly used for testing systems ability to recognise handwritten digits accuracy rates can be measured in several ways and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate for example if word context basically a lexicon of words is not used to correct software finding non existent words a character error rate of 1 99 accuracy may result in an error rate of 5 95 accuracy or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognized with no incorrect letters 91 36 93 using a large enough dataset is so important in a neural network based handwriting recognition solutions on the other hand producing natural datasets is very complicated and time consuming 91 37 93 an example of the difficulties inherent in digitizing old text is the inability of ocr to differentiate between the long s and f characters 91 38 93 web based ocr systems for recognizing hand printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years 91 when 93 see tablet pc history accuracy rates of 80 to 90 on neat clean hand printed characters can be achieved by pen computing software but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page making the technology useful only in very limited applications 91 citation needed 93 recognition of cursive text is an active area of research with recognition rates even lower than that of hand printed text higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information for example recognizing entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script reading the amount line of a cheque which is always a written out number is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly the shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately greater than 98 recognize all handwritten cursive script 91 citation needed 93 most programs allow users to set confidence rates this means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy a user can be notified for manual review an error introduced by ocr scanning is sometimes termed a scanno by analogy with the term typo 91 39 93 91 40 93 unicode edit main article optical character
