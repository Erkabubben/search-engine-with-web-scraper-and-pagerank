face and head useful to optimise the ergonomic design of headgear and eyewear the syntouch biotac 91 2 93 a multimodal tactile sensor modeled after the human fingertip a tactile sensor is a device that measures information arising from physical interaction with its environment tactile sensors are generally modeled after the biological sense of cutaneous touch which is capable of detecting stimuli resulting from mechanical stimulation temperature and pain although pain sensing is not common in artificial tactile sensors tactile sensors are used in robotics computer hardware and security systems a common application of tactile sensors is in touchscreen devices on mobile phones and computing tactile sensors may be of different types including piezoresistive piezoelectric optical capacitive and elastoresistive sensors 91 3 93 contents 1 uses 2 pressure sensor arrays 3 optically based tactile sensors 4 strain gauge rosettes 5 biologically inspired tactile sensors 6 diy and open hardware tactile sensors 7 see also 8 references 9 external links uses edit tactile sensors appear in everyday life such as elevator buttons and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base there are also innumerable other applications for tactile sensors of which most people are never aware sensors that measure very small changes must have very high sensitivities sensors need to be designed to have a small effect on what is measured making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages tactile sensors can be used to test the performance of all types of applications for example these sensors have been used in the manufacturing of automobiles brakes clutches door seals gasket battery lamination bolted joints fuel cells etc tactile imaging as a medical imaging modality translating the sense of touch into a digital image is based on the tactile sensors tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern robots designed to interact with objects requiring handling involving precision dexterity or interaction with unusual objects need sensory apparatus which is functionally equivalent to a human s tactile ability tactile sensors have been developed for use with robots 91 4 93 91 5 93 91 better 160 source 160 needed 93 tactile sensors can complement visual systems by providing added information when the robot begins to grip an object at this time vision is no longer sufficient as the mechanical properties of the object cannot be determined by vision alone determining weight texture stiffness center of mass coefficient of friction and thermal conductivity require object interaction and some sort of tactile sensing several classes of tactile sensors are used in robots of different kinds for tasks spanning collision avoidance and manipulation 91 citation needed 93 some methods for simultaneous localization and mapping are based on tactile sensors 91 6 93 pressure sensor arrays edit pressure sensor arrays are large grids of tactels a tactel is a tactile element each tactel is capable of detecting normal forces tactel based sensors provide a high resolution image of the contact surface alongside spatial resolution and force sensitivity systems integration questions such as wiring and signal routing are important 91 7 93 pressure sensor arrays are available in thin film form they are primarily used as analytical tools used in the manufacturing and r amp d processes by engineers and technicians and have been adapted for use in robots examples of such sensors available to consumers include arrays built from conductive rubber 91 8 93 lead zirconate titanate pzt polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf pvdf trfe 91 9 93 fet 91 10 93 and metallic capacitive sensing 91 11 93 91 12 93 elements optically based tactile sensors edit several kinds of tactile sensors have been developed that take advantage of camera like technology to provide high resolution data a key exemplar is the gelsight technology first developed at mit which uses a camera behind an opaque gel layer to achieve high resolution tactile feedback 91 13 93 91 14 93 the samsung see through your skin sts sensor uses a semi transparent gel to produce combined tactile and optical imaging 91 15 93 strain gauge rosettes edit strain gauges rosettes are constructed from multiple strain gauges with each gauge detecting the force in a particular direction when the information from each strain gauge is combined the information allows determination of a pattern of forces or torques 91 16 93 biologically inspired tactile sensors edit a variety of biologically inspired designs have been suggested ranging from simple whisker like sensors which measure only one point at a time 91 17 93 through more advanced fingertip like sensors 91 18 93 91 19 93 91 20 93 to complete skin like sensors as on the latest icub 91 citation needed 93 biologically inspired tactile sensors often incorporate more than one sensing strategy for example they might detect both the distribution of pressures and the pattern of forces that would come from pressure sensor arrays and strain gauge rosettes allowing two point discrimination and force sensing with human like ability advanced versions of biologically designed tactile sensors include vibration sensing which has been determined to be important for understanding interactions between the tactile sensor and objects where the sensor slides over the object such interactions are now understood to be important for human tool use and judging the texture of an object 91 18 93 one such sensor combines force sensing vibration sensing and heat transfer sensing 91 2 93 diy and open hardware tactile sensors edit recently a sophisticated tactile sensor has been made open hardware enabling enthusiasts and hobbyists to experiment with an otherwise expensive technology 91 21 93 furthermore with the advent of cheap optical cameras novel sensors have been proposed which can be built easily and cheaply with a 3d printer 91 22 93 see also edit tactile technology list of sensors pressure measurement sensitivity touch sensor transducer tactile imaging references edit dobie gordon 7 may 2021
