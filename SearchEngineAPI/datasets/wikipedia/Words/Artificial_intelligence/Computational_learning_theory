theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called supervised learning in supervised learning an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way for example the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible the algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier this classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm the goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples in addition to performance bounds computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning 91 citation needed 93 in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time 91 citation needed 93 there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results 160 8211 32 showing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time negative results 160 8211 32 showing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time negative results often rely on commonly believed but yet unproven assumptions 91 citation needed 93 such as computational complexity p np the p versus np problem cryptographic one way functions exist there are several different approaches to computational learning theory based on making different assumptions about the inference principles used to generalise from limited data this includes different definitions of probability see frequency probability bayesian probability and different assumptions on the generation of samples 91 citation needed 93 the different approaches include exact learning proposed by dana angluin 91 citation needed 93 probably approximately correct learning pac learning proposed by leslie valiant 91 2 93 vc theory proposed by
