german 32 tlo p fre 8 november 1848 26 july 1925 was a german philosopher logician and mathematician he was a mathematics professor at the university of jena and is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy concentrating on the philosophy of language logic and mathematics though he was largely ignored during his lifetime giuseppe peano 1858 1932 bertrand russell 1872 1970 and to some extent ludwig wittgenstein 1889 1951 introduced his work to later generations of philosophers frege is widely considered to be the greatest logician since aristotle and one of the most profound philosophers of mathematics ever 91 16 93 his contributions include the development of modern logic in the begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics his book the foundations of arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project and is cited by michael dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn his philosophical papers on sense and reference and the thought are also widely cited the former argues for two different types of meaning and descriptivism in foundations and the thought frege argues for platonism against psychologism or formalism concerning numbers and propositions respectively russell s paradox undermined the logicist project by showing frege s basic law v in the foundations to be false contents 1 life 1 1 childhood 1848 69 1 2 studies at

schwerin today part of mecklenburg vorpommern his father carl karl alexander frege 1809 1866 was the co founder and headmaster of a girls high school until his death after carl s death the school was led by frege s mother auguste wilhelmine sophie frege n e bialloblotzky 12 january 1815 14 october 1898 her mother was auguste amalia maria ballhorn a descendant of philipp melanchthon 91 17 93 and her father was johann heinrich siegfried bialloblotzky a descendant of a polish noble family who left poland in the 17th century 91 18 93 frege was a lutheran 91 19 93 in childhood frege encountered philosophies that would guide his future scientific career for example his father wrote a textbook on the german language for children aged 9 13 entitled h lfsbuch zum unterrichte in der deutschen sprache f r kinder von 9 bis 13 jahren 2nd ed wismar 1850 3rd ed wismar and ludwigslust hinstorff 1862 help book for teaching german to children from 9 to 13 years old the first section of which dealt with the structure and logic of language frege studied at gro e stadtschule wismar 160 91 de 93 and graduated in 1869 91 20 93 his teacher gustav adolf leo sachse 5 november 1843 1 september 1909 who was a poet played the most important role in determining frege s future scientific career encouraging him to continue his studies at the university of jena studies at university 1869 74 edit frege matriculated at the university of jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the north german confederation in the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures most of them on mathematics and physics his most important teacher was ernst karl abbe 1840 1905 physicist mathematician and inventor abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity galvanism and electrodynamics complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable applications of physics selected divisions of mechanics and mechanics of solids abbe was more than a teacher to frege he was a trusted friend and as director of the optical manufacturer carl zeiss ag he was in a position to advance frege s career after frege s graduation they came into closer correspondence his other notable university teachers were christian philipp karl snell 1806 86 subjects use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry analytic geometry of planes analytical mechanics optics physical foundations of mechanics hermann karl julius traugott schaeffer 1824 1900 analytic geometry applied physics algebraic analysis on the telegraph and other electronic machines and the philosopher kuno fischer 1824 1907 kantian and critical philosophy starting in 1871 frege continued his studies in g ttingen the leading university in mathematics in german speaking territories where he attended the lectures of rudolf friedrich alfred clebsch 1833 72 analytic geometry ernst christian julius schering 1824 97 function theory wilhelm eduard weber 1804 91 physical studies applied physics eduard riecke 1845 1915 theory of electricity and hermann lotze 1817 81 philosophy of religion many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature frege have parallels in lotze it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on frege s views arising from his attending lotze s lectures in 1873 frege attained his doctorate under ernst christian julius schering with a dissertation under the title of ueber eine geometrische darstellung der imagin ren gebilde in der ebene on a geometrical representation of imaginary forms in a plane in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry s infinitely distant imaginary points frege married margarete katharina sophia anna lieseberg 15 february 1856 25 june 1904 on 14 march 1887 91 20 93 work as a logician edit main article begriffsschrift though his education and early mathematical work focused primarily on geometry frege s work soon turned to logic his begriffsschrift eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete formelsprache des reinen denkens 91 concept script a formal language for pure thought modeled on that of arithmetic 93 halle a s verlag von louis nebert 1879 marked a turning point in the history of logic the begriffsschrift broke new ground including a rigorous treatment of the ideas of functions and variables frege s goal was to show that mathematics grows out of logic and in so doing he devised techniques that separated him from the aristotelian syllogistic but took him rather close to stoic propositional logic 91 21 93 title page to begriffsschrift 1879 in effect frege invented axiomatic predicate logic in large part thanks to his invention of quantified variables which eventually became ubiquitous in mathematics and logic and which solved the problem of multiple generality previous logic had dealt with the logical constants and or if then not and some and all but iterations of these operations especially some and all were little understood even the distinction between a sentence like every boy loves some girl and some girl is loved by every boy could be represented only very artificially whereas frege s formalism had no difficulty expressing the different readings of every boy loves some girl who loves some boy who loves some girl and similar sentences in complete parallel with his treatment of say every boy is foolish a frequently noted example is that aristotle s logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like euclid s theorem a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of prime numbers frege s conceptual notation however can represent such inferences 91 22 93 the analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to principia mathematica 3 vols 1910 13 by bertrand russell 1872 1970 and alfred north whitehead 1861 1947 to russell s theory of descriptions to kurt g del s 1906 78 incompleteness theorems and to alfred tarski s 1901 83 theory of truth is ultimately due to frege one of frege s stated purposes was to isolate genuinely logical principles of inference so that in the proper representation of mathematical proof one would at no point appeal to intuition if there was an intuitive element it was to be isolated and represented separately as an axiom from there on the proof was to be purely logical and without gaps having exhibited this possibility frege s larger purpose was to defend the view that arithmetic is a branch of logic a view known as logicism unlike geometry arithmetic was to be shown to have no basis in intuition and no need for non logical axioms already in the 1879 begriffsschrift important preliminary theorems for example a generalized form of law of trichotomy were derived within what frege understood to be pure logic this idea was formulated in non symbolic terms in his the foundations of arithmetic die grundlagen der arithmetik 1884 later in his basic laws of arithmetic grundgesetze der arithmetik vol 1 1893 vol 2 1903 vol 2 was published at his own expense frege attempted to derive by use of his symbolism all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical most of these axioms were carried over from his begriffsschrift though not without some significant changes the one truly new principle was one he called the basic law v the value range of the function f x is the same as the value range of the function g x if and only if x f x g x the crucial case of the law may be formulated in modern notation as follows let x fx denote the extension of the predicate fx that is the set of all fs and similarly for gx then basic law v says that the predicates fx and gx have the same extension if and only if x fx gx the set of fs is the same as the set of gs just in case every f is a g and every g is an f the case is special because what is here being called the extension of a predicate or a set is only one type of value range of a function in a famous episode bertrand russell wrote to frege just as vol 2 of the grundgesetze was about to go to press in 1903 showing that russell s paradox could be derived from frege s basic law v it is easy to define the relation of membership of a set or extension in frege s system russell then drew attention to the set of things x that are such that x is not a member of x the system of the grundgesetze entails that the set thus characterised both is and is not a member of itself and is thus inconsistent frege wrote a hasty last minute appendix to vol 2 deriving the contradiction and proposing to eliminate it by modifying basic law v frege opened the appendix with the exceptionally honest comment hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished this was the position i was placed in by a letter of mr bertrand russell just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion this letter and frege s reply are translated in jean van heijenoort 1967 frege s proposed remedy was subsequently shown to imply that there is but one object in the universe of discourse and hence is worthless indeed this would make for a contradiction in frege s system if he had axiomatized the idea fundamental to his discussion that the true and the false are distinct objects see for example dummett 1973 but recent work has shown that much of the program of the grundgesetze might be salvaged in other ways basic law v can be weakened in other ways the best known way is due to philosopher and mathematical logician george boolos 1940 1996 who was an expert on the work of frege a concept f is small if the objects falling under f cannot be put into one to one correspondence with the universe of discourse that is unless r r is 1 to 1 amp x y xry amp fy now weaken v to v a concept f and a concept g have the same extension if and only if neither f nor g is small or x fx gx v is consistent if second order arithmetic is and suffices to prove the axioms of second order arithmetic basic law v can simply be replaced with hume s principle which says that the number of fs is the same as the number of gs if and only if the fs can be put into a one to one correspondence with the gs this principle too is consistent if second order arithmetic is and suffices to prove the axioms of second order arithmetic this result is termed frege s theorem because it was noticed that in developing arithmetic frege s use of basic law v is restricted to a proof of hume s principle it is from this in turn that arithmetical principles are derived on hume s principle and frege s theorem see frege s logic theorem and foundations for arithmetic 91 23 93 frege s logic now known as second order logic can be weakened to so called predicative second order logic predicative second order logic plus basic law v is provably consistent by finitistic or constructive methods but it can interpret only very weak fragments of arithmetic 91 24 93 frege s work in logic had little international attention until 1903 when russell wrote an appendix to the principles of mathematics stating his differences with frege the diagrammatic notation that frege used had no antecedents and has had no imitators since moreover until russell and whitehead s principia mathematica 3 vols appeared in 1910 13 the dominant approach to mathematical logic was still that of george boole 1815 64 and his intellectual descendants especially ernst schr der 1841 1902 frege s logical ideas nevertheless spread through the writings of his student rudolf carnap 1891 1970 and other admirers particularly bertrand russell and ludwig wittgenstein 1889 1951 philosopher edit frege c 1905 frege is one of the founders of analytic philosophy whose work on logic and language gave rise to the linguistic turn in philosophy his contributions to the philosophy of language include function and argument analysis of the proposition distinction between concept and object begriff und gegenstand principle of compositionality context principle and distinction between the sense and reference sinn und bedeutung of names and other expressions sometimes said to involve a mediated reference theory as a philosopher of mathematics frege attacked the psychologistic appeal to mental explanations of the content of judgment of the meaning of sentences his original purpose was very far from answering general questions about meaning instead he devised his logic to explore the foundations of arithmetic undertaking to answer questions such as what is a number or what objects do number words one two etc refer to but in pursuing these matters he eventually found himself analysing and explaining what meaning is and thus came to several conclusions that proved highly consequential for the subsequent course of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language sense and reference edit main article sense and reference frege s 1892 paper on sense and reference ber sinn und bedeutung introduced his influential distinction between sense sinn and reference bedeutung which has also been translated as meaning or denotation while conventional accounts of meaning took expressions to have just one feature reference frege introduced the view that expressions have two different aspects of significance their sense and their reference reference or bedeutung applied to proper names where a given expression say the expression tom simply refers to the entity bearing the name the person named tom frege also held that propositions had a referential relationship with their truth value in other words a statement refers to the truth value it takes by contrast the sense or sinn associated with a complete sentence is the thought it expresses the sense of an expression is said to be the mode of presentation of the item referred to and there can be multiple modes of representation for the same referent the distinction can be illustrated thus in their ordinary uses the name charles philip arthur george mountbatten windsor which for logical purposes is an unanalyzable whole and the functional expression the prince of wales which contains the significant parts the prince of and wales have the same reference namely the person best known as prince charles but the sense of the word wales is a part of the sense of the latter expression but no part of the sense of the full name of prince charles these distinctions were disputed by bertrand russell especially in his paper on denoting the controversy has continued into the present fueled especially by saul kripke s famous lectures naming and necessity 1924 diary edit frege s published philosophical writings were of a very technical nature and divorced from practical issues so much so that frege scholar dummett expressed his shock to discover while reading frege s diary that his hero was an anti semite 91 25 93 after the german revolution of 1918 19 his political opinions became more radical in the last year of his life at the age of 76 his diary contained political opinions opposing the parliamentary system democrats liberals catholics the french and jews who he thought ought to be deprived of political rights and preferably expelled from germany 91 26 93 frege confided that he had once thought of himself as a liberal and was an admirer of bismarck but then sympathized with general ludendorff in an entry dated 5 may 1924 frege expressed agreement with an article published in houston stewart chamberlain s deutschlands erneuerung which praised adolf hitler 91 27 93 frege recorded the belief that it would be best if the jews of germany would get lost or better would like to disappear from germany 91 27 93 some interpretations have been written about that time 91 28 93 the diary contains a critique of universal suffrage and socialism frege had friendly relations with jews in real life among his students was gershom scholem 91 29 93 91 30 93 who greatly valued his teaching and it was he who encouraged ludwig wittgenstein to leave for england in order to study with bertrand russell 91 31 93 the 1924 diary was published posthumously in 1994 91 32 93 frege apparently never spoke in public about his political viewpoints 91 citation needed 93 personality edit frege was described by his students as a highly introverted person seldom entering into dialogues with others and mostly facing the blackboard while lecturing he was however known to occasionally show wit and even bitter sarcasm during his classes 91 33 93
