general see history of philosophy the separation of philosophy and science from theology began in greece during the 6th century bc 91 3 93 thales an astronomer and mathematician was considered by aristotle to be the first philosopher of the greek tradition 91 a 93 while pythagoras coined the word 91 citation needed 93 the first 91 citation needed 93 known elaboration on the topic was conducted by plato in his symposium he concludes that love is that which lacks the object it seeks therefore the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom if he attains wisdom he would be a sage therefore the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom and living in accordance to that wisdom 91 4 93 disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed these disagreements gave rise to different hellenistic schools of philosophy in consequence the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition 91 5 93 as the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate the competition lay in living in a manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world 91 6 93 according to the classicist pierre hadot the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominantly through three changes 91 6 93 the first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory 91 6 93 the second is the historical change throughout the medieval era with the rise of christianity the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology thus philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual logical physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life philosophy was then the servant to theology 91 6 93 the third is the sociological need with the development of the university the modern university requires professionals to teach maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty therefore the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life 91 6 93 many philosophers still emerged from the classical tradition as saw their philosophy as a way of life however with the rise of the university the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended taught and developed their works in university 91 7 93 in the modern era those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system as part of the wider professionalisation process of the discipline in the 20th century 91 8 93 according to a 1993 study by the national research council as reported by the american philosophical association 77 1 of the 7 900 holders of a phd in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions academia various prizes
