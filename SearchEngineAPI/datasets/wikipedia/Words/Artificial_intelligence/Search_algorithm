allows for fast retrieval of information in computer science a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure or calculated in the search space of a problem domain with either discrete or continuous values algorithms are although search engines use search algorithms they belong to the study of information retrieval not algorithmics the appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched and may also include prior knowledge about the data search algorithms can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures such as search trees hash maps and database indexes 91 1 93 91 full citation needed 93 91 2 93 search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms linear binary and hashing linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion 91 3 93 binary or half interval searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found and can be applied on data structures with a defined order 91 4 93 digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys 91 5 93 finally hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function 91 6 93 algorithms are often evaluated by their computational complexity or maximum theoretical run time binary search functions for example have a maximum complexity of o log n or logarithmic time in simple terms the maximum number of operations needed to find the search target is a logarithmic function of the size of the search space contents 1 applications of search algorithms 2 classes 2 1 for virtual search spaces 2 2

books 5 2 2 articles 6 external links applications of search algorithms edit specific applications of search algorithms include problems in combinatorial optimization such as the vehicle routing problem a form of shortest path problem the knapsack problem given a set of items each with a weight and a value determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible the nurse scheduling problem problems in constraint satisfaction such as the map coloring problem filling in a sudoku or crossword puzzle in game theory and especially combinatorial game theory choosing the best move to make next such as with the minmax algorithm finding a combination or password from the whole set of possibilities factoring an integer an important problem in cryptography optimizing an industrial process such as a chemical reaction by changing the parameters of the process like temperature pressure and ph retrieving a record from a database finding the maximum or minimum value in a list or array checking to see if a given value is present in a set of values classes edit for virtual search spaces edit see also solver algorithms for searching virtual spaces are used in the constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to find a set of value assignments to certain variables that will satisfy specific mathematical equations and inequations equalities they are also used when the goal is to find a variable assignment that will maximize or minimize a certain function of those variables algorithms for these problems include the basic brute force search also called na ve or uninformed search and a variety of heuristics that try to exploit partial knowledge about the structure of this space such as linear relaxation constraint generation and constraint propagation an important subclass are the local search methods that view the elements of the search space as the vertices of a graph with edges defined by a set of heuristics applicable to the case and scan the space by moving from item to item along the edges for example according to the steepest descent or best first criterion or in a stochastic search this category includes a great variety of general metaheuristic methods such as simulated annealing tabu search a teams and genetic programming that combine arbitrary heuristics in specific ways the opposite of local search would be global search methods this method is applicable when the search space is not limited and all aspects of the given network are available to the entity running the search algorithm 91 7 93 this class also includes various tree search algorithms that view the elements as vertices of a tree and traverse that tree in some special order examples of the latter include the exhaustive methods such as depth first search and breadth first search as well as various heuristic based search tree pruning methods such as backtracking and branch and bound unlike general metaheuristics which at best work only in a probabilistic sense many of these tree search methods are guaranteed to find the exact or optimal solution if given enough time this is called completeness another important sub class consists of algorithms for exploring the game tree of multiple player games such as chess or backgammon whose nodes consist of all possible game situations that could result from the current situation the goal in these problems is to find the move that provides the best chance of a win taking into account all possible moves of the opponent s similar problems occur when humans or machines have to make successive decisions whose outcomes are not entirely under one s control such as in robot guidance or in marketing financial or military strategy planning this kind of problem combinatorial search has been extensively studied in the context of artificial intelligence examples of algorithms for this class are the minimax algorithm alpha beta pruning and the a algorithm and its variants for sub structures of a given structure edit the name combinatorial search is generally used for algorithms that look for a specific sub structure of a given discrete structure such as a graph a string a finite group and so on the term combinatorial optimization is typically used when the goal is to find a sub structure with a maximum or minimum value of some parameter since the sub structure is usually represented in the computer by a set of integer variables with constraints these problems can be viewed as special cases of constraint satisfaction or discrete optimization but they are usually formulated and solved in a more abstract setting where the internal representation is not explicitly mentioned an important and extensively studied subclass are the graph algorithms in particular graph traversal algorithms for finding specific sub structures in a given graph such as subgraphs paths circuits and so on examples include dijkstra s algorithm kruskal s algorithm the nearest neighbour algorithm and prim s algorithm another important subclass of this category are the string searching algorithms that search for patterns within strings two famous examples are the boyer moore and knuth morris pratt algorithms and several algorithms based on the suffix tree data structure search for the maximum of a function edit in 1953 american statistician jack kiefer devised fibonacci search which can be used to find the maximum of a unimodal function and has many other applications in computer science for quantum computers edit there are also search methods designed for quantum computers like grover s algorithm that are theoretically faster than linear or brute force search even without the help of data structures or heuristics while the ideas and applications behind quantum computers are still entirely theoretical studies have been conducted with algorithms like grover s that accurately replicate the hypothetical physical versions of quantum computing systems 91 8 93 search engine optimization edit main article search engine optimization search algorithms used in a search engine such as google order the relevant search results based on a myriad of important factors 91 9 93 search engine optimization seo is the process in which any given search result will work in conjunction with the search algorithm to organically gain more traction attention and clicks to their site this can go as far as attempting to adjust the search engines algorithm to favor a specific search result more heavily but the strategy revolving around seo has become incredibly important and relevant in the business world 91 9 93 see also edit backward induction content addressable memory 160 8211 special
