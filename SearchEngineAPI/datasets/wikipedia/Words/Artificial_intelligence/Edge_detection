detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying edges curves in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or more formally has discontinuities the same problem of finding discontinuities in one dimensional signals is known as step detection and the problem of finding signal discontinuities over time is known as change detection edge detection is a

of detecting sharp changes in image brightness is to capture important events and changes in properties of the world it can be shown that under rather general assumptions for an image formation model discontinuities in image brightness are likely to correspond to 91 2 93 91 3 93 discontinuities in depth discontinuities in surface orientation changes in material properties and variations in scene illumination in the ideal case the result of applying an edge detector to an image may lead to a set of connected curves that indicate the boundaries of objects the boundaries of surface markings as well as curves that correspond to discontinuities in surface orientation thus applying an edge detection algorithm to an image may significantly reduce the amount of data to be processed and may therefore filter out information that may be regarded as less relevant while preserving the important structural properties of an image if the edge detection step is successful the subsequent task of interpreting the information contents in the original image may therefore be substantially simplified however it is not always possible to obtain such ideal edges from real life images of moderate complexity edges extracted from non trivial images are often hampered by fragmentation meaning that the edge curves are not connected missing edge segments as well as false edges not corresponding to interesting phenomena in the image thus complicating the subsequent task of interpreting the image data 91 4 93 edge detection is one of the fundamental steps in image processing image analysis image pattern recognition and computer vision techniques edge properties edit the edges extracted from a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene can be classified as either viewpoint dependent or viewpoint independent a viewpoint independent edge typically reflects inherent properties of the three dimensional objects such as surface markings and surface shape a viewpoint dependent edge may change as the viewpoint changes and typically reflects the geometry of the scene such as objects occluding one another a typical edge might for instance be the border between a block of red color and a block of yellow in contrast a line as can be extracted by a ridge detector can be a small number of pixels of a different color on an otherwise unchanging background for a line there may therefore usually be one edge on each side of the line a simple edge model edit although certain literature has considered the detection of ideal step edges the edges obtained from natural images are usually not at all ideal step edges instead they are normally affected by one or several of the following effects focal blur caused by a finite depth of field and finite point spread function penumbral blur caused by shadows created by light sources of non zero radius shading at a smooth object a number of researchers have used a gaussian smoothed step edge an error function as the simplest extension of the ideal step edge model for modeling the effects of edge blur in practical applications 91 4 93 91 5 93 thus a one dimensional image f displaystyle f that has exactly one edge placed at x 0 displaystyle x 0 may be modeled as f x i r x2212 i x2113 2 erf x2061 x 2 x03c3 1 i x2113 displaystyle f x frac i r i ell 2 left operatorname erf left frac x sqrt 2 sigma right 1 right i ell at the left side of the edge the intensity is i x2113 lim x x2192 x2212 x221e f x displaystyle i ell lim x rightarrow infty f x and right of the edge it is i r lim x x2192 x221e f x displaystyle i r lim x rightarrow infty f x the scale parameter x03c3 displaystyle sigma is called the blur scale of the edge ideally this scale parameter should be adjusted based on the quality of image to avoid destroying true edges of the image 91 citation needed 93 why it is a non trivial task edit to illustrate why edge detection is not a trivial task consider the problem of detecting edges in the following one dimensional signal here we may intuitively say that there should be an edge between the 4th and 5th pixels 5 7 6 4 152 148 149 if the intensity difference were smaller between the 4th and the 5th pixels and if the intensity differences between the adjacent neighboring pixels were higher it would not be as easy to say that there should be an edge in the corresponding region moreover one could argue that this case is one in which there is more than one edge 5 7 6 41 113 148 149 hence to firmly state a specific threshold on how large the intensity change between two neighbouring pixels must be for us to say that there should be an edge between these pixels is not always simple 91 4 93 indeed this is one of the reasons why edge detection may be a non trivial problem unless the objects in the scene are particularly simple and the illumination conditions can be well controlled see for example the edges extracted from the image with the girl above approaches edit there are many methods for edge detection but most of them can be grouped into two categories search based and zero crossing based the search based methods detect edges by first computing a measure of edge strength usually a first order derivative expression such as the gradient magnitude and then searching for local directional maxima of the gradient magnitude using a computed estimate of the local orientation of the edge usually the gradient direction the zero crossing based methods search for zero crossings in a second order derivative expression computed from the image in order to find edges usually the zero crossings of the laplacian or the zero crossings of a non linear differential expression as a pre processing step to edge detection a smoothing stage typically gaussian smoothing is almost always applied see also noise reduction the edge detection methods that have been published mainly differ in the types of smoothing filters that are applied and the way the measures of edge strength are computed as many edge detection methods rely on the computation of image gradients they also differ in the types of filters used for computing gradient estimates in the x and y directions a survey of a number of different edge detection methods can be found in ziou and tabbone 1998 91 6 93 see also the encyclopedia articles on edge detection in encyclopedia of mathematics 91 3 93 and encyclopedia of computer science and engineering 91 7 93 canny edit main article canny edge detector john canny considered the mathematical problem of deriving an optimal smoothing filter given the criteria of detection localization and minimizing multiple responses to a single edge 91 8 93 he showed that the optimal filter given these assumptions is a sum of four exponential terms he also showed that this filter can be well approximated by first order derivatives of gaussians canny also introduced the notion of non maximum suppression which means that given the presmoothing filters edge points are defined as points where the gradient magnitude assumes a local maximum in the gradient direction looking for the zero crossing of the 2nd derivative along the gradient direction was first proposed by haralick 91 9 93 it took less than two decades to find a modern geometric variational meaning for that operator that links it to the marr hildreth zero crossing of the laplacian edge detector that observation was presented by ron kimmel and alfred bruckstein 91 10 93 although his work was done in the early days of computer vision the canny edge detector including its variations is still a state of the art edge detector 91 11 93 edge detectors that perform better than the canny usually require longer computation times or a greater number of parameters kovalevsky edit vladimir a kovalevsky 91 12 93 has suggested a quite different approach he uses a preprocessing of the image with the sigma filter 91 13 93 and with a special filter for the dilution of the ramps this method uses no brightness of the image but only the intensities of the color channels which is important for detecting an edge between two adjacent pixels of equal brightness but different colors the method scans the image two times first along the horizontal lines and second along the vertical columns in each horizontal line six consequent adjacent pixels are considered and five color difference between each two adjacent pixels are calculated each color difference is the sum of absolute differences of the intensities of the color channels red green and blue of the corresponding adjacent pixels if this sum is greater than a given threshold then the sign of the color difference is set equal to the sign of the difference of the green intensities if the green difference is zero then the sign of the color difference is set equal to the sign of the difference of the red intensities if however both the green and the red differences are zero then the sign of the color difference is set equal to the sign of the blue difference which in this case cannot be zero since the sum is greater than the threshold certain conditions for the values and signs of the five color differences are specified in such way that if the conditions are fulfilled then a short vertical stroke is put between the third and the fourth of the six pixels as the label of the edge similar calculations are performed for the vertical columns in this case a short horizontal stroke is put between the third and the fourth of the six subsequent pixels the vertical and horizontal strokes being the one dimensional cells of an abstract cell complex corresponding to the image mostly compose a connected sequence representing the edge this method is robust and very fast and what is more important it can detect edges between adjacent pixels of equal brightness s if the color difference between these pixels is greater than the threshold the canny deriche detector was derived from similar mathematical criteria as the canny edge detector although starting from a discrete viewpoint and then leading to a set of recursive filters for image smoothing instead of exponential filters or gaussian filters 91 14 93 the differential edge detector described below can be seen as a reformulation of canny s method from the viewpoint of differential invariants computed from a scale space representation leading to a number of advantages in terms of both theoretical analysis and sub pixel implementation in that aspect log gabor filter have been shown to be a good choice to extract boundaries in natural scenes 91 15 93 other first order methods edit different gradient operators can be applied to estimate image gradients from the input image or a smoothed version of it the simplest approach is to use central differences l

operators for estimating image gradient have been proposed in the prewitt operator roberts cross kayyali 91 16 93 operator and frei chen operator it is possible to extend filters dimension to avoid the issue of recognizing edge in low snr image the cost of this operation is loss in terms of resolution examples are extended prewitt 7 7 thresholding and linking edit once we have computed a measure of edge strength typically the gradient magnitude the next stage is to apply a threshold to decide whether edges are present or not at an image point the lower the threshold the more edges will be detected and the result will be increasingly susceptible to noise and detecting edges of irrelevant features in the image conversely a high threshold may miss subtle edges or result in fragmented edges if the edge is applied to just the gradient magnitude image the resulting edges will in general be thick and some type of edge thinning post processing is necessary for edges detected with non maximum suppression however the edge curves are thin by definition and the edge pixels can be linked into edge polygon by an edge linking edge tracking procedure on a discrete grid the non maximum suppression stage can be implemented by estimating the gradient direction using first order derivatives then rounding off the gradient direction to multiples of 45 degrees and finally comparing the values of the gradient magnitude in the estimated gradient direction a commonly used approach to handle the problem of appropriate thresholds for thresholding is by using thresholding with hysteresis this method uses multiple thresholds to find edges we begin by using the upper threshold to find the start of an edge once we have a start point we then trace the path of the edge through the image pixel by pixel marking an edge whenever we are above the lower threshold we stop marking our edge only when the value falls below our lower threshold this approach makes the assumption that edges are likely to be in continuous curves and allows us to follow a faint section of an edge we have previously seen without meaning that every noisy pixel in the image is marked down as an edge still however we have the problem of choosing appropriate thresholding parameters and suitable thresholding values may vary over the image edge thinning edit edge thinning is a technique used to remove the unwanted spurious points on the edges in an image this technique is employed after the image has been filtered for noise using median gaussian filter etc the edge operator has been applied like the ones described above canny or sobel to detect the edges and after the edges have been smoothed using an appropriate threshold value this removes all the unwanted points and if applied carefully results in one pixel thick edge elements advantages sharp and thin edges lead to greater efficiency in object recognition if hough transforms are used to detect lines and ellipses then thinning could give much better results if the edge happens to be the boundary of a region then thinning could easily give the image parameters like perimeter without much algebra there are many popular algorithms used to do this one such is described below choose a type of connectivity like 8 6 or 4 8 connectivity is preferred where all the immediate pixels surrounding a particular pixel are considered remove points from north south east and west do this in multiple passes i e after the north pass use the same semi processed image in the other passes and so on remove a point if the point has no neighbors in the north if you are in the north pass and respective directions for other passes the point is not the end of a line the point is isolated removing the points will not cause to disconnect its neighbors in any way else keep the point the number of passes across direction should be chosen according to the level of accuracy desired second order approaches edit some edge detection operators are instead based upon second order derivatives of the intensity this essentially captures the rate of change in the intensity gradient thus in the ideal continuous case detection of zero crossings in the second derivative captures local maxima in the gradient the early marr hildreth operator is based on the detection of zero crossings of the laplacian operator applied to a gaussian smoothed image it can be shown however that this operator will also return false edges corresponding to local minima of the gradient magnitude moreover this operator will give poor localization at curved edges hence this operator is today mainly of historical interest differential edit a more refined second order edge detection approach which automatically detects edges with sub pixel accuracy uses the following differential approach of detecting zero crossings of the second order directional derivative in the gradient direction following the differential geometric way of expressing the requirement of non maximum suppression proposed by lindeberg 91 4 93 91 17 93 let us introduce at every image point a local coordinate system u v displaystyle u v with the v displaystyle v direction parallel to the gradient direction assuming that the image has been pre smoothed by gaussian smoothing and a scale space representation l x y t displaystyle l x y t at scale t displaystyle t has been computed we can require that the gradient magnitude of the scale space representation which is equal to the first order directional derivative in the v displaystyle v direction l v displaystyle l v should have its first order directional derivative in the v displaystyle v direction equal to zero x2202 v l v 0 displaystyle partial v l v 0 while the second order directional derivative in the v displaystyle v

computed from a scale space representation l displaystyle l obtained by smoothing the original image with a gaussian kernel in this way the edges will be automatically obtained as continuous curves

recent development in edge detection techniques takes a frequency domain approach to finding edge locations phase congruency also known as phase coherence methods attempt to find locations in an image where all sinusoids in the frequency domain are in phase these locations will generally correspond to the location of a perceived edge regardless of whether the edge is represented by a large change in intensity in the spatial domain a key benefit of this technique is that it responds strongly to mach bands and avoids false positives typically found around roof edges a roof edge is a discontinuity in the first order derivative of a grey level profile 91 18 93 phase stretch transform pst edit feature enhancement in an image st paul s cathedral london using phase stretch transform pst left panel shows the original image and the right panel shows the detected features using pst the phase stretch transform or pst is a physics inspired computational approach to signal and image processing one of its utilities is for feature detection and classification 91 19 93 91 20 93 pst is a spin off from research on the time stretch dispersive fourier transform pst transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3d dispersive property refractive index the operation relies on symmetry of the dispersion profile and can be understood in terms of dispersive eigenfunctions or stretch modes 91 21 93 pst performs similar functionality as phase contrast microscopy but on digital images pst is also applicable to digital images as well as temporal time series data subpixel edit to increase the precision of edge detection several subpixel techniques had been proposed including curve fitting moment based 91 22 93 91 23 93 reconstructive and partial area effect methods 91 24 93 these methods have different characteristics curve fitting methods are computationally simple but are easily affected by noise moment based methods use an integral based approach to reduce the effect of noise but may require more computations in some cases reconstructive methods use horizontal gradients or vertical gradients to build a curve and find the peak of the curve as the sub pixel edge partial area effect methods are based on the hypothesis that each pixel value depends on the area at both sides of the edge inside that pixel producing accurate individual estimation for every edge pixel certain variants of the moment based technique have been shown to be the most accurate for isolated edges 91 23 93 edge detection on an angiographic
