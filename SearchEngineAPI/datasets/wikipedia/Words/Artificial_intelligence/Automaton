or automatons is a relatively self operating machine or control mechanism designed to automatically follow a sequence of operations or respond to predetermined instructions 91 1 93 some automata such as bellstrikers in mechanical clocks are designed to give the illusion to the casual observer that they are operating under their own power since long ago the term is commonly associated with automated puppets that resemble moving humans or animals built to impress and or to entertain people animatronics are a modern type of automata with electronics often used for the portrayal of

s own will this word was first used by homer to describe an automatic door opening 91 2 93 or automatic movement of wheeled tripods 91 3 93 it is more often used to describe non electronic moving machines especially those that have been made to resemble human or animal actions such as the jacks on old public striking clocks or the cuckoo and any other animated figures on a cuckoo clock history edit ancient edit the book about automata by hero of alexandria 1589 edition in ancient egyptian legends statues of divinities mostly made of stone metal or wood were animated and played a key role in religious ceremonies they were believed to have a soul a k derived from the divinity they represented in the new kingdom of egypt from the 16th century bc until the 11th century bc ancient egyptians would frequently consult these statues for advice the statues would reply with a movement of the head according to egyptian lore pharaoh hatshepsut dispatched her squadron to the land of incense after consulting with the statue of amun 91 4 93 there are many examples of automata in greek mythology hephaestus created automata for his workshop 91 5 93 91 6 93 talos was an artificial man of bronze king alkinous of the phaiakians employed gold and silver watchdogs 91 7 93 91 8 93 according to aristotle daedalus used quicksilver to make his wooden statue of aphrodite move 91 9 93 91 10 93 in other greek legends he used quicksilver to install voice in his moving statues the automata in the hellenistic world were intended as tools toys religious spectacles or prototypes for demonstrating basic scientific principles numerous water powered automata were built by ktesibios a greek inventor and the first head of the great library of alexandria for example he used water to sound a whistle and make a model owl move he had invented the world s first cuckoo clock 91 a 93 this tradition continued in alexandria with inventors such as the greek mathematician hero of alexandria sometimes known as heron whose writings on hydraulics pneumatics and mechanics described siphons a fire engine a water organ the aeolipile and a programmable cart 91 11 93 91 12 93 philo of byzantium was famous for his inventions the antikythera mechanism from 150 to 100 bc was designed to calculate the positions of astronomical objects complex mechanical devices are known to have existed in hellenistic greece though the only surviving example is the antikythera mechanism the earliest known analog computer 91 13 93 the clockwork is thought to have come originally from rhodes where there was apparently a tradition of mechanical engineering the island was renowned for its automata to quote pindar s seventh olympic ode the animated figures stand adorning every public street and seem to breathe in stone or move their marble feet however the information gleaned from recent scans of the fragments indicate that it may have come from the colonies of corinth in sicily and implies a connection with archimedes according to jewish legend king solomon used his wisdom to design a throne with mechanical animals which hailed him as king when he ascended it upon sitting down an eagle would place a crown upon his head and a dove would bring him a torah scroll it is also said that when king solomon stepped upon the throne a mechanism was set in motion as soon as he stepped upon the first step a golden ox and a golden lion each stretched out one foot to support him and help him rise to the next step on each side the animals helped the king up until he was comfortably seated upon the throne 91 14 93 in ancient china a curious account of automata is found in the lie zi text believed to have originated around 400 bce and compiled around the fourth century ce within it there is a description of a much earlier encounter between king mu of zhou 1023 957 bce and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi an artificer the latter proudly presented the king with a very realistic and detailed life size human shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork the king stared at the figure in astonishment it walked with rapid strides moving its head up and down so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being the artificer touched its chin and it began singing perfectly in tune he touched its hand and it began posturing keeping perfect time as the performance was drawing to an end the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance whereupon the king became incensed and would have had yen shih yan shi executed on the spot had not the latter in mortal fear instantly taken the robot to pieces to let him see what it really was and indeed it turned out to be only a construction of leather wood glue and lacquer variously coloured white black red and blue examining it closely the king found all the internal organs complete liver gall heart lungs spleen kidneys stomach and intestines and over these again muscles bones and limbs with their joints skin teeth and hair all of them artificial the king tried the effect of taking away the heart and found that the mouth could no longer speak he took away the liver and the eyes could no longer see he took away the kidneys and the legs lost their power of locomotion the king was delighted 91 15 93 other notable examples of automata include archytas dove mentioned by aulus gellius 91 16 93 similar chinese accounts of flying automata are written of the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban who made artificial wooden birds ma yuan that could successfully fly according

visit to constantinople in 949 ambassador liutprand of cremona described automata in the emperor theophilos palace including lions made either of bronze or wood covered with gold which struck the ground with their tails and roared with open mouth and quivering tongue a tree of gilded bronze its branches filled with birds likewise made of bronze gilded over and these emitted cries appropriate to their species and the emperor s throne itself which was made in such a cunning manner that at one moment it was down on the ground while at another it rose higher and was to be seen up in the air 91 18 93 similar automata in the throne room singing birds roaring and moving lions were described by luitprand s contemporary the byzantine emperor constantine porphyrogenitus in his book in the mid 8th century the first wind powered automata were built statues that turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the round city of baghdad the public spectacle of wind powered statues had its private counterpart in the abbasid palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed 91 19 93 also in the 8th century the muslim alchemist j bir ibn hayy n geber included recipes for constructing artificial snakes scorpions and humans that would be subject to their creator s control in his coded book of stones in 827 abbasid caliph al ma mun had a silver and golden tree in his palace in baghdad which had the features of an automatic machine there were metal birds that sang automatically on the swinging branches of this tree built by muslim inventors and engineers 91 20 93 91 page 160 needed 93 the abbasid caliph al muqtadir also had a silver and golden tree in his palace in baghdad in 917 with birds on it flapping their wings and singing 91 21 93 in the 9th century the ban m s brothers invented a programmable automatic flute player and which they described in their book of ingenious devices 91 22 93 automaton in the swiss museum cima an automaton writing a letter in swiss museum cima al jazari described complex programmable humanoid automata amongst other machines he designed and constructed in the book of knowledge of ingenious mechanical devices in 1206 91 23 93 his automaton was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties 91 24 93 his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs cams that bump into little levers that operate the percussion the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns if the pegs were moved around 91 25 93 according to charles b fowler the automata were a robot band which performed more than fifty facial and body actions during each musical selection 91 26 93 al jazari constructed a hand washing automaton first employing the flush mechanism now used in modern toilets it features a female automaton standing by a basin filled with water when the user pulls the lever the water drains and the automaton refills the basin 91 27 93 his peacock fountain was another more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants who offer soap and towels mark e rosheim describes it as follows pulling a plug on the peacock s tail releases water out of the beak as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap when more water is used a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure with a towel 91 28 93 al jazari thus appears to have been the first inventor to display an interest in creating human like machines for practical purposes such as manipulating the environment for human comfort 91 29 93

in a drawing titled how to make an angel keep pointing his finger toward the sun with an angel that would perpetually turn to face the sun he also drew an automaton of a bird with jointed wings which led to their design implementation in clocks 91 citation needed 93 at the end of the thirteenth century robert ii count of artois built a pleasure garden at his castle at hesdin that incorporated several automata as entertainment in the walled park the work was conducted by local workmen and overseen by the italian knight renaud coignet it included monkey marionettes a sundial supported by lions and wild men mechanized birds mechanized fountains and a bellows operated organ the park was famed for its automata well into the fifteenth century before it was destroyed by english soldiers in

submission and use and on the other of functioning and explanation there was a useful body and an intelligible body the celebrated automata of the 18th century were not only a way of illustrating an
