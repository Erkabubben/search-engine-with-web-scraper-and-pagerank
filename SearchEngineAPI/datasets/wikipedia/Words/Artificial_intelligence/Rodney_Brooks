in 1981 he received a phd in computer science from stanford university under the supervision of thomas binford 91 5 93 he has held research positions at carnegie mellon university and mit and a faculty position at stanford university he joined the faculty of mit in 1984 he was panasonic professor of robotics at the massachusetts institute of technology he was director of the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory 1997 2007 previously the artificial intelligence laboratory in 1997 brooks and his work were featured in the film fast cheap amp out of control 91 6 93 brooks became a member of the national academy of engineering in 2004 for contributions to the foundations and applications of robotics including the establishment of consumer and hazardous environment robotics industries 91 7 93 work edit academic work edit rodney brooks in 2005 instead of computation as the ultimate conceptual metaphor that helped artificial intelligence become a separate discipline in the scientific community he proposed that action or behavior are more appropriate to be used in robotics critical of applying the computational metaphor even to the fields where the action metaphor is more appropriate he wrote in 2008 that some of my colleagues have managed to recast pluto s orbital behavior as the body itself carrying out computations on forces that apply to it i think we are perhaps better off using newtonian mechanics with a little einstein thrown in to understand and predict the orbits of planets and others it is so much simpler 91 8 93 in his 1990 paper elephants don t play chess 91 9 93 brooks argued that in order for robots to accomplish everyday tasks in an environment shared by humans their higher cognitive abilities including abstract thinking emulated by symbolic reasoning need to be based on the primarily sensory motor coupling action with the environment complemented by the proprioceptive sense which is a key component in hand eye coordination pointing out that over time there s been a realization that vision sound processing and early language are maybe the keys to how our brain is organized 91 6 93 industrial work edit brooks was an entrepreneur before leaving academia to found rethink robotics he was one of ten founders of lucid inc and worked with them until the company s closure in 1993 91 citation needed 93 before lucid closed brooks had founded irobot with former students colin angle and helen greiner robots edit robot at rethink robotics 2013 brooks is at the right in the lineup behind the robot at left is steve jurvetson the photographer he experimented with off the shelf components such as fischertechnik and lego and tried to make robots self replicate by putting together clones of themselves using the components his robots include mini robots used in oil wells explorations without cables the robots that searched for survivors at ground zero in new york and the robots used in medicine doing robotic surgery 91 6 93 allen in the late 1980s brooks and his team introduced allen a robot using subsumption architecture as of 2012 91 update 93 brooks work focused on engineering intelligent robots to operate in unstructured environments and understanding human intelligence through building humanoid robots 91 citation needed 93 baxter main article baxter robot introduced in 2012 by rethink robotics an industrial robot named baxter was intended as the robotic analogue of the early personal computer designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers and be programmable for the performance of simple tasks the robot stopped if it encountered a human in the way of its robotic arm and has a prominent off switch which its human partner can push if necessary costs were projected to be the equivalent of a worker making 4 an hour 91 10 93 bibliography edit this list is incomplete you can help by adding missing items april 2017 brooks rodney march 1986 a robust layered
