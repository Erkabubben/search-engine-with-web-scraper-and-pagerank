deep structure and surface structure from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from deep structure jump to navigation jump to search deep structure and surface structure also d structure and s structure although those abbreviated forms are sometimes used with distinct meanings are concepts used in linguistics specifically in the study of syntax in the chomskyan tradition of transformational generative grammar the deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures for example the sentences pat loves chris and chris is loved by pat mean roughly the same thing and use similar words some linguists chomsky in particular have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common or very similar 91 1 93 deep structure contents 1 origin 2 in chomskyan linguistics 3 extension to other fields 4 see also 5 notes 6 references origin edit chomsky coined and popularized the terms deep structure and surface structure in the early 1960s 91 2 93 american linguist sydney lamb wrote in 1975 that chomsky probably borrowed the term from hockett 91 3 93 american linguist charles hockett first used the dichotomous pair deep grammar vs surface grammar in his 1958 book titled a course in modern linguistics chomsky first referred to these hockettian concepts in his 1962 paper the logical basis of linguistic theory later published as current issues in linguistic theory in 1964 in it chomsky noted that the difference between observational and descriptive adequacy is related to the distinction drawn by hockett 1958 between surface grammar and deep grammar and he is unquestionably correct in noting that modern linguistics is largely confined in scope to the former 91 4 93 in chomskyan linguistics edit in early transformational syntax deep structures are derivation trees of a context free language these trees are then transformed by a sequence of tree rewriting operations transformations into surface structures the terminal yield of a surface structure tree the surface form is then predicted to be a grammatical sentence of the language being studied the role and significance of deep structure changed a great deal as chomsky developed his theories and since the mid 1990s deep structure no longer features at all 91 5 93 see minimalist program it is tempting to regard deep structures as representing meanings and surface structures as representing sentences that express those meanings but this is not the concept of deep structure which chomsky favoured rather a sentence more closely corresponds to a deep structure paired with the surface structure derived from it with an additional phonetic form obtained from processing of the surface structure it has been variously suggested that the interpretation of a sentence is determined by its deep structure alone by a combination of its deep and surface structures or by some other level of representation altogether logical form as argued in 1977 by chomsky s student robert may chomsky may have tentatively entertained the first of these ideas in the early 1960s but quickly moved away from it to the second and finally to the third throughout the 1960s and 1970s the generative semantics movement put up a vigorous defence of the first option sparking an acrimonious debate the linguistics wars 91 6 93 chomsky noted in his early years that by dividing deep structures from surface structures one could understand slip of the tongue moments where someone says something that he did not intend as instances where deep structures do not translate into the intended surface structure 91 7 93 extension to other fields edit the surface appeal of the deep structure concept soon led people from unrelated fields architecture music politics and even ritual studies to use the term to express various concepts in their own work in common usage the term is often used as a synonym for universal grammar the constraints which chomsky claims govern the overall forms of linguistic expression available to the human species this is probably due to the importance of deep structure in chomsky s earlier work on universal grammar though his concept of universal grammar is logically independent of any particular theoretical construct including deep structure according to middleton 1990 schenkerian analysis of music corresponds to the chomskyan notion of deep structure applying to a two level generative structure for melody harmony and rhythm of which the analysis by lee 1985 of rhythmical structure is an instance see also chord progression blues changes see also edit underlying representation notes edit in the first formulations of transformational grammar active and passive pairs had identical deep structures as the theory developed it became necessary to mark whether a sentence was active or passive in the deep structure itself with the result that active passive pairs had almost but not quite identical deep structures kordi 1991 pp 160 105 106 lamb 2006 p 160 179 chomsky 1964 p 160 30 cipriani enrico semantics in generative grammar a critical survey lingvisticae
