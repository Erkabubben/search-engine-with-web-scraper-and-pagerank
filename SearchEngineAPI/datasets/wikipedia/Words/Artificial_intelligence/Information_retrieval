preservation privacy quantum information science vte information retrieval ir in computing and information science is the process of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources searches can be based on full text or other content based indexing information retrieval is the science 91 1 93 of searching for information in a document searching for documents themselves and also searching for the metadata that describes data and for databases of texts images or sounds automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload an ir system is a software system that provides access to books journals and other documents stores and manages those documents web search engines are

12 external links overview edit an information retrieval process begins when a user or searcher enters a query into the system queries are formal statements of information needs for example search strings in web search engines in information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection instead several objects may match the query perhaps with different degrees of relevance an object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database user queries are matched against the database information however as opposed to classical sql queries of a database in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query so results are typically ranked this ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching 91 2 93 depending on the application the data objects may be for example text documents images 91 3 93 audio 91 4 93 mind maps 91 5 93 or videos often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the ir system but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata most ir systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query and rank the objects according to this value the top ranking objects are then shown to the user the process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query 91 6 93 history edit there is a machine called the univac whereby letters and figures are coded as a pattern of magnetic spots on a long steel tape by this means the text of a document preceded by its subject code symbol can be recorded the machine automatically selects and types out those references which have been coded in any desired way at a rate of 120 words a minute 8201 j e holmstrom 1948 the idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article as we may think by vannevar bush in 1945 91 7 93 it would appear that bush was inspired by patents for a statistical machine filed by emanuel goldberg in the 1920s and 30s that searched for documents stored on film 91 8 93 the first description of a computer searching for information was described by holmstrom in 1948 91 9 93 detailing an early mention of the univac computer automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy desk set in the 1960s the first large information retrieval research group was formed by gerard salton at cornell by the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the cranfield collection several thousand documents 91 7 93 large scale retrieval systems such as the lockheed dialog system came into use early in the 1970s in 1992 the us department of defense along with the national institute of standards and technology nist cosponsored the text retrieval conference trec as part of the tipster text program the aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection this catalyzed research on methods that scale to huge corpora the introduction of web search engines has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further applications edit areas where information retrieval techniques are employed include the entries are in alphabetical order within each category general applications edit digital libraries information filtering recommender systems media search blog search image retrieval 3d retrieval music retrieval news search speech retrieval video retrieval search engines site search desktop search enterprise search federated search mobile

information retrieval in software engineering legal information retrieval vertical search other retrieval methods edit methods techniques in which information retrieval techniques are employed include adversarial information retrieval automatic summarization multi document summarization compound term processing cross lingual retrieval document classification spam filtering question answering model types edit categorization of ir models translated from german entry original source dominik kuropka for effectively retrieving relevant documents by ir strategies the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes the picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models in the picture the models are categorized according to two dimensions the mathematical basis and the properties of the model first dimension mathematical basis edit set theoretic models represent documents as sets of words or phrases similarities are usually derived from set theoretic operations on those sets common models are standard boolean model extended boolean model fuzzy retrieval algebraic models represent documents and queries usually as vectors matrices or tuples the similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value vector space model generalized vector space model enhanced topic based vector space model extended boolean model latent semantic indexing a k a latent semantic analysis probabilistic models treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query probabilistic theorems like the bayes theorem are often used in these models binary independence model probabilistic relevance model on which is based the okapi bm25 relevance function uncertain inference language models divergence from randomness model latent dirichlet allocation feature based retrieval models view documents as vectors of values of feature functions or just features and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score typically by learning to rank methods feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just another feature second dimension properties of the model edit models without term interdependencies treat different terms words as independent this fact is usually represented in vector space models by the orthogonality assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an independency assumption for term variables models with immanent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms however the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself it is usually directly or indirectly derived e g by dimensional reduction from the co occurrence of those terms in the whole set of documents models with transcendent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined they rely an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms for example a human or sophisticated algorithms performance and correctness measures edit main article evaluation measures information retrieval the evaluation of an information retrieval system is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users in general measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query traditional evaluation metrics designed for boolean retrieval 91 clarification needed 93 or top k retrieval include precision and recall all measures assume a ground truth notion of relevance every document is known to be either relevant or non relevant to a particular query in practice queries may be ill posed and there may be different shades of relevance timeline edit before the 1900s 1801 joseph marie jacquard invents the jacquard loom the first machine to use punched cards to
