aim is to surround more territory than the opponent the game was invented in china more than 2 500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 3 93 a 2016 survey by the international go federation s 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play go and over 20 million current players the majority of whom live in east asia 91 4 93 the playing pieces are called stones one player uses the white stones and the other black the players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections points of a board once placed on the board stones may not be moved but stones are removed from the board if the stone or group of stones is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points in which case the stone or group is captured 91 5 93 the game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move when a game concludes the winner is determined by counting each player s surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second 91 6 93 games may also be terminated by resignation the standard go board has a 19 19 grid of lines containing 361 points beginners often play on smaller 9 9 and 13 13 boards 91 7 93 and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17 17 grid however boards with a 19 19 grid had become standard by the time the game reached korea in the 5th century ce and japan in the 7th century ce 91 8 93 go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic chinese scholars in antiquity the earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal zuo zhuan 91 9 93 91 10 93 c 8201 4th century bce 91 11 93 despite its relatively simple rules go is extremely complex compared to chess go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and on average many more alternatives to consider per move the number of legal board positions in go has been calculated to be approximately 2 1 10170 91 12 93 91 a 93 which is

encirclement board game 39 32 or board game of surrounding 39 in english the name go when used for the game is often capitalized to differentiate it from the common word go 91 15 93 in events sponsored by the ing chang ki foundation it is spelled goe 91 16 93 the korean word baduk derives from the middle korean word badok the origin of which is controversial the more plausible etymologies include the suffix dok added to ba to mean flat and wide board or the joining of bat meaning field and dok meaning stone less plausible etymologies include a derivation of badukdok referring to the playing pieces of the game or a derivation from chinese p izi meaning to arrange pieces 91 17 93 overview edit the first 150 moves of a go game animated click on the board to restart the animation in a larger window go is an adversarial game with the objective of surrounding a larger total area of the board with one s stones than the opponent 91 18 93 as the game progresses the players position stones on the board to map out formations and potential territories contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion reduction or wholesale capture and loss of formation stones the four liberties adjacent empty points of a single black stone a as white reduces those liberties by one b c and d when black has only one liberty left d that stone is in atari 91 19 93 white may capture that stone remove from board with a play on its last liberty at d 1 a basic principle of go is that a group of stones must have at least one open point bordering the group known as a liberty to remain on the board one or more liberties enclosed within a group is called an eye and a group with two or more eyes cannot be captured even if surrounded 91 20 93 such groups are said to be unconditionally alive 91 21 93 the general strategy is to expand one s territory attack the opponent s weak groups groups that can be killed and always stay mindful of the life status of one s own groups 91 22 93 91 23 93 the liberties of groups are countable situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races or semeai 91 24 93 in a capturing race the group with more liberties will ultimately be able to capture the opponent s stones 91 24 93 91 25 93 91 b 93 capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of go players may pass rather than place a stone if they think there are no further opportunities for profitable play 91 26 93 the game ends when both players pass 91 27 93 or when one player resigns in general to score the game each player counts the number of unoccupied points surrounded by their stones and then subtracts the number of stones that were captured by the opponent the player with the greater score after adjusting for komi wins the game in the opening stages of the game players typically establish positions or bases in the corners and around the sides of the board usually starting on the third or fourth line from the border rather than at the very edge of the board these bases help to quickly develop strong shapes which have many options for life self viability for a group of stones that prevents capture and establish formations for potential territory 91 28 93 players usually start in the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board 91 29 93 established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently 91 30 93 dame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white and as such are considered to be of no value to either side seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes a ko chinese and japanese is a repeated position shape that may be contested by making forcing moves elsewhere after the forcing move is played the ko may be taken back and returned to its original position 91 31 93 some ko fights may be important and decide the life of a large group while others may be worth just one or two points some ko fights are referred to as picnic kos when only one side has a lot to lose 91 32 93 the japanese call it a hanami flower viewing ko 91 33 93 playing with others usually requires a knowledge of each player s strength indicated by the player s rank increasing from 30 160 kyu to 1 160 kyu then 1 160 dan to 7 160 dan then 1 160 dan pro to 9 160 dan pro a difference in rank may be compensated by a handicap black is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for white s greater strength 91 34 93 91 35 93 there are different rule sets korean japanese chinese aga etc which are almost entirely equivalent except for certain special case positions rules edit main article rules of go aside from the order of play alternating moves black moves first or takes a handicap and scoring rules there are essentially only two rules in go rule 1 the rule of liberty states that every stone remaining on the board must have at least one open point a liberty directly orthogonally adjacent up down left or right or must be part of a connected group that has at least one such open point liberty next to it stones or groups of stones which lose their last liberty are removed from the board rule 2 the ko rule states that the stones on the board must never repeat a previous position of stones moves which would do so are forbidden and thus only moves elsewhere on the board are permitted that turn almost all other information about how the game is played is a heuristic meaning it is learned information about how the game is played rather than a rule other rules are specialized as they come about through different rule sets but the above two rules cover almost all of any played game although there are some minor differences between rule sets used in different countries 91 36 93 most notably in chinese and japanese scoring rules 91 37 93 these differences do not greatly affect the tactics and strategy of the game except where noted the basic rules presented here are valid independent of the scoring rules used the scoring rules are explained separately go terms for which there is no ready english equivalent are commonly called by their japanese names basic rules edit one black chain and two white chains with their liberties marked with dots liberties are shared among all stones of a chain and can be counted here the black group has 5 liberties while the two white chains have 4 liberties each the two players black and white take turns placing stones of their colour on the intersections of the board one stone at a time the usual board size is a 19 19 grid but for beginners or for playing quick games 91 38 93 the smaller board sizes of 13 13 91 39 93 and 9 9 are also popular 91 40 93 the board is empty to begin with 91 41 93 black plays first unless given a handicap of two or more stones in which case white plays first the players may choose any unoccupied intersection to play on except for those forbidden by the ko and suicide rules see below once played a stone can never be moved and can be taken off the board only if it is captured 91 42 93 a player may pass their turn declining to place a stone though this is usually only done at the end of the game when both players believe nothing more can be accomplished with further play when both players pass consecutively the game ends 91 43 93 and is then scored liberties and capture edit if white plays at a the black chain loses its last liberty it is captured and removed from the board vertically and horizontally adjacent stones of the same color form a chain also called a string or group 91 44 93 forming a discrete unit that cannot then be divided 91 45 93 only stones connected to one another by the lines on the board create a chain stones that are diagonally adjacent are not connected chains may be expanded by placing additional stones on adjacent intersections and they can be connected together by placing a stone on an intersection that is adjacent to two or more chains of the same color 91 46 93 a vacant point adjacent to a stone along one of the grid lines of the board is called a liberty for that stone 91 47 93 91 48 93 stones in a chain share their liberties 91 44 93 a chain of stones must have at least one liberty to remain on the board when a chain is surrounded by opposing stones so that it has no liberties it is captured and removed from the board 91 49 93 ko rule edit main article ko fight an example of a situation in which the ko rule applies players are not allowed to make a move that returns the game to the previous position this rule called the ko rule prevents unending repetition 91 50 93 as shown in the example pictured black has just played the stone marked 1 capturing a white stone at the intersection marked with the red circle if white were allowed to play on the marked intersection that move would capture the black stone marked 1 and recreate the situation before black made the move marked 1 allowing this could result in an unending cycle of captures by both players the ko rule therefore prohibits white from playing at the marked intersection immediately instead white must play elsewhere or pass black can then end the ko by filling at the marked intersection creating a five stone black chain if white wants to continue the ko that specific repeating position white tries to find a play elsewhere on the board that black must answer if black answers then white can retake the ko a repetition of such exchanges is called a ko fight 91 51 93 while the various rule sets agree on the ko rule prohibiting returning the board to an immediately previous position they deal in different ways with the relatively uncommon situation in which a player might recreate a past position that is further removed see rules of go 160 repetition for further information suicide edit under normal rules white cannot play at a because that point has no liberties under the ing 91 52 93 and new zealand rules 91 53 93 white may play a a suicide stone that kills itself and the two neighboring white stones leaving an empty three space eye black naturally answers by playing at a creating two eyes to live a player may not place a stone such that it or its group immediately has no liberties unless doing so immediately deprives an enemy group of its final liberty in the second case the enemy group is captured leaving the new stone with at least one liberty so the new stone can be placed 91 54 93 this rule is responsible for the all important difference between one and two eyes if a group with only one eye is fully surrounded on the outside it can be killed with a stone placed in its single eye the ing and new zealand rules do not have this rule 91 55 93 and there a player might destroy one of its own groups commit suicide this play would only be useful in limited sets of situations involving a small interior space or planning 91 56 93 in the example at right it may be useful as a ko threat komi edit main article komi go because black has the advantage of playing the first move the idea of awarding white some compensation came into being during the 20th century this is called komi which gives white a 6 5 point compensation under japanese rules number of points varies by rule set 91 57 93 under handicap play white receives only a 0 5 point komi to break a possible tie jigo scoring rules edit a simplified game at its end black s territory a c and prisoners d is counted and compared to white s territory b only no prisoners in this example both black and white attempted to invade and live c and d groups to reduce the other s total territory only black s invading group c was successful in living as white s group d was killed with a black stone at e the points in the middle f are dame meaning they belong to neither player two general types of scoring system are used and players determine which to use before play both systems almost always give the same result territory scoring counts the number of empty points a player s stones surround together with the number of stones the player captured area scoring counts the number of points a player s stones occupy and surround it is associated with contemporary chinese play and was probably established there during the ming dynasty in the 15th or 16th century 91 58 93 after both players have passed consecutively the stones that are still on the board but unable to avoid capture called dead stones are removed area scoring including chinese a player s score is the number of stones that the player has on the board plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player s stones territory scoring including japanese and korean in the course of the game each player retains the stones they capture termed prisoners any dead stones removed at the end of the game become prisoners the score is the number of empty points enclosed by a player s stones plus the number of prisoners captured by that player 91 c 93 if there is disagreement about which stones are dead then under area scoring rules the players simply resume play to resolve the matter the score is computed using the position after the next time the players pass consecutively under territory scoring the rules are considerably more complex however in practice players generally play on and once the status of each stone has been determined return to the position at the time the first two consecutive passes occurred and remove the dead stones for further information see rules of go given that the number of stones a player has on the board is directly related to the number of prisoners their opponent has taken the resulting net score that is the difference between black s and white s scores is identical under both rulesets unless the players have passed different numbers of times during the course of the game thus the net result given by the two scoring systems rarely differs by more than a point 91 59 93 life and death edit see also life and death while not actually mentioned in the rules of go at least in simpler rule sets such as those of new zealand and the u s the concept of a living group of stones is necessary for a practical understanding of the game 91 60 93 examples of eyes marked the black groups at the top of the board are alive as they have at least two eyes the black groups at the bottom are dead as they only have one eye the point marked a is a false eye therefore the black group with false eye a is killed by white when a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones elsewhere the status of the group is either alive dead or unsettled a group of stones is said to be alive if it cannot be captured even if the opponent is allowed to move first conversely a group of stones is said to be dead if it cannot avoid capture even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move otherwise the group is said to be unsettled the defending player can make it alive or the opponent can kill it depending on who gets to play first 91 60 93 an eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by a group of stones if the eye is surrounded by black stones white cannot play there unless such a play would take black s last liberty and capture the black stones such a move is forbidden according to the suicide rule in most rule sets but even if not forbidden such a move would be a useless suicide of a white stone if a black group has two eyes white can never capture it because white cannot remove both liberties simultaneously if black has only one eye white can capture the black group by playing in the single eye removing black s last liberty such a move is not suicide because the black stones are removed first in the examples of eyes diagram all the circled points are eyes the two black groups in the upper corners are alive as both have at least two eyes the groups in the lower corners are dead as both have only one eye the group in the lower left may seem to have two eyes but the surrounded empty point marked a is not actually an eye white can play there and take a black stone such a point is often called a false eye 91 60 93 seki mutual life edit example of seki mutual life neither black nor white can play on the marked points without reducing their own liberties for those groups to one self atari there is an exception to the requirement that a group must have two eyes to be alive a situation called seki or mutual life where different colored groups are adjacent and share liberties the situation may reach a position when neither player wants to move first because doing so would allow the opponent to capture in such situations therefore both players stones remain on the board in seki neither player receives any points for those groups but at least those groups themselves remain living as opposed to being captured 91 d 93 seki can occur in many ways the simplest are each player has a group without eyes and they share two liberties and each player has a group with one eye and they share one more liberty in the example of seki mutual life diagram the circled points are liberties shared by both a black and a white group neither player wants to play on a circled point because doing so would allow the opponent to capture all the other groups in this example both black and white are alive with at least two eyes seki can result from an attempt by one player to invade and kill a nearly settled group of the other player 91 60 93 tactics edit main article go strategy and tactics in go tactics deal with immediate fighting between stones capturing and saving stones life death and other issues localized to a specific part of the board larger issues not limited to only part of the board are referred to as strategy and are covered in their own section capturing tactics edit there are several tactical constructs aimed at capturing stones 91 61 93 these are among the first things a player learns after understanding the rules recognizing the possibility that stones can be captured using these techniques is an important step forward a ladder black cannot escape unless the ladder connects to black stones further down the board that will intercept with the ladder or if one of white s pieces have only one liberty the most basic technique is the ladder 91 62 93 to capture stones in a ladder a player uses a constant series of capture threats atari to force the opponent into a zigzag pattern as shown in the adjacent diagram unless the pattern runs into friendly stones along the way the stones in the ladder cannot avoid capture experienced players recognize the futility of continuing the pattern and play elsewhere a net the chain of three marked black stones cannot escape in any direction another technique to capture stones is the so called net 91 63 93 also known by its japanese name geta this refers to a move that loosely surrounds some stones preventing their escape in all directions an example is given in the adjacent diagram it is generally better to capture stones in a net than in a ladder because a net does not depend on the condition that there are no opposing stones in the way nor does it allow the opponent to play a strategic ladder breaker a snapback although black can capture the white stone by playing at the circled point the resulting shape for black has only one liberty at 1 thus white can then capture the three black stones by playing at 1 again snapback a third technique to capture stones is the snapback 91 64 93 in a snapback one player allows a single stone to be captured then immediately plays on the point formerly occupied by that stone by so doing the player captures a larger group of their opponent s stones in effect snapping back at those stones an example can be seen on the right as with the ladder an experienced player does not play out such a sequence recognizing the futility of capturing only to be captured back immediately reading ahead edit one of the most important skills required for strong tactical play is the ability to read ahead 91 65 93 reading ahead includes considering available moves to play the possible responses to each move and the subsequent possibilities after each of those responses some of the strongest players of the game can read up to 40 moves ahead even in complicated positions 91 66 93 as explained in the scoring rules some stone formations can never be captured and are said to be alive while other stones may be in the position where they cannot avoid being captured and are said to be dead much of the practice material available to players of the game comes in the form of life and death problems also known as tsumego 91 67 93 in such problems players are challenged to find the vital move sequence that kills a group of the opponent or saves a group of their own tsumego are considered an excellent way to train a player s ability at reading ahead 91 67 93 and are available for all skill levels some posing a challenge even to top players ko fighting edit a simplified ko fight on a 9 9 board the ko is at the point marked with a square black has taken the ko first the ko fight determines the life of the a and b groups only one survives and the other is captured white may play c as a ko threat and black properly answers at d white can then take the ko by playing at the square marked point capturing the one black stone e is a possible ko threat for black in situations when the ko rule applies a ko fight may occur 91 51 93 if the player who is prohibited from capture is of the opinion that the capture is important because it prevents a large group of stones from being captured for instance the player may play a ko threat 91 51 93 this is a move elsewhere on the board that threatens to make a large profit if the opponent does not respond if the opponent does respond to the ko threat the situation on the board has changed and the prohibition on capturing the ko no longer applies thus the player who made the ko threat may now recapture the ko their opponent is then in the same situation and can either play a ko threat as well or concede the ko by simply playing elsewhere if a player concedes the ko either because they do not think it important or because there are no moves left that could function as a ko threat they have lost the ko and their opponent may connect the ko instead of responding to a ko threat a player may also choose to ignore the threat and connect the ko 91 51 93 they thereby win the ko but at a cost the choice of when to respond to a threat and when to ignore it is a subtle one which requires a player to consider many factors including how much is gained by connecting how much is lost by not responding how many possible ko threats both players have remaining what the optimal order of playing them is and what the size points lost or gained of each of the remaining threats is 91 68 93 frequently the winner of the ko fight does not connect the ko but instead captures one of the chains that constituted their opponent s side of the ko 91 51 93 in some cases this leads to another ko fight at a neighboring location strategy edit main article go strategy and tactics strategy deals with global influence interaction between distant stones keeping the whole board in mind during local fights and other issues that involve the overall game it is therefore possible to allow a tactical loss when it confers a strategic advantage novices often start by randomly placing stones on the board as if it were a game of chance an understanding of how stones connect for greater power develops and then a few basic common opening sequences may be understood learning the ways of life and death helps in a fundamental way to develop one s strategic understanding of weak groups 91 e 93 a player who both plays aggressively and can handle adversity is said to display kiai or fighting spirit in the game basic concepts edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed february 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message main article go terms basic strategic aspects include the following connection keeping one s own stones connected means that fewer groups need to make living shape and one has fewer groups to defend cut keeping opposing stones disconnected means that the opponent needs to defend and make living shape for more groups stay alive the simplest way to stay alive is to establish a foothold in the corner or along one of the sides at a minimum a group must have two eyes separate open points to be alive 91 69 93 an opponent cannot fill in either eye as any such move is suicidal and prohibited in the rules mutual life seki is better than dying a situation in which neither player can play on a particular point without then allowing the other player to play at another point to capture the most common example is that of adjacent groups that share their last few liberties if either player plays in the shared liberties they can reduce their own group to a single liberty putting themselves in atari allowing their opponent to capture it on the next move death a group that lacks living shape is eventually removed from the board as captured invasion set up a new living group inside an area where the opponent has greater influence means one reduces the opponent s score in proportion to the area one occupies reduction placing a stone far enough into the opponent s area of influence to reduce the amount of territory they eventually get but not so far in that it can be cut off from friendly stones outside sente a play that forces one s opponent to respond gote a player who can regularly play sente has the initiative and can control the flow of the game sacrifice allowing a group to die in order to carry out a play or plan in a more important area the strategy involved can become very abstract and complex high level players spend years improving their understanding of strategy and a novice may play many hundreds of games against opponents before being able to win regularly opening strategy edit main article go opening in the opening of the game players usually play and gain territory in the corners of the board first as the presence of two edges makes it easier for them to surround territory and establish their stones 91 70 93 from a secure position in a corner it is possible to lay claim to more territory by extending along the side of the board 91 71 93 the opening is the most theoretically difficult part of the game and takes a large proportion of professional players thinking time 91 72 93 91 73 93 the first stone played at a corner of the board is generally placed on the third or fourth line from the edge players tend to play on or near the 4 4 star point during the opening playing nearer to the edge does not produce enough territory to be efficient and playing further from the edge does not safely secure the territory 91 74 93 in the opening players often play established sequences called joseki which are locally balanced exchanges 91 75 93 however the joseki chosen should also produce a satisfactory result on a global scale it is generally advisable to keep a balance between territory and influence which of these gets precedence is often a matter of individual taste middlegame and endgame edit the middle phase of the game is the most combative and usually lasts for more than 100 moves during the middlegame the players invade each other s territories and attack formations that lack the necessary two eyes for viability such groups may be saved or sacrificed for something more significant on the board 91 76 93 it is possible that one player may succeed in capturing a large weak group of the opponent s which often proves decisive and ends the game by a resignation however matters may be more complex yet with major trade offs apparently dead groups reviving and skillful play to attack in such a way as to construct territories rather than kill 91 77 93 the end of the middlegame and transition to the endgame is marked by a few features near the end of a game play becomes divided into localized fights that do not affect each other 91 78 93 with the exception of ko fights where before the central area of the board related to all parts of it no large weak groups are still in serious danger moves can reasonably be attributed some definite value such as 20 points or fewer rather than simply being necessary to compete both players set limited objectives in their plans in making or destroying territory capturing or saving stones these changing aspects of the game usually occur at much the same time for strong players in brief the middlegame switches into the endgame when the concepts of strategy and influence need reassessment in terms of concrete final results on the board history edit main article history of go origin in china edit the earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal zuo zhuan 91 9 93 91 10 93 c 8201 4th century bce 91 11 93 referring to a historical event of 548 160 bce it is also mentioned in book xvii of the analects of confucius 91 11 93 and in two books written by mencius 91 10 93 91 79 93 c 8201 3rd century bce 91 11 93 in all of these works

warlords and generals who used pieces of stone to map out attacking positions 91 81 93 91 82 93 in china go was considered one of the four cultivated arts of the chinese scholar gentleman along with

baduk hangul and a variant of the game called sunjang baduk was developed by the 16th century sunjang baduk became the main variant played in korea until the end of the 19th century when the current version was reintroduced from japan 91 85 93 91 86 93 the game reached japan in the 7th century ce where it is called go or igo it became popular at the japanese imperial court in the 8th century 91 87 93 and among the general public by the 13th century 91 88 93 the game was further formalized in the 15th century in 1603 tokugawa ieyasu re established japan s unified national government in the same year he assigned the then best player in japan a buddhist monk named nikkai n kan yosaburo 1559 to the post of godokoro minister of go 91 89 93 nikkai took the name hon inb sansa and founded the hon inb go school 91 89 93 several competing schools were founded soon after 91 89 93 these officially recognized and subsidized go schools greatly developed the level of play and introduced the dan

its widespread popularity in east asia go has been slow to spread to the rest of the world although there are some mentions of the game in western literature from the 16th century forward go did not start to become popular in the west until the end of the 19th century when german scientist oskar korschelt wrote a treatise on the game 91 92 93 by the early 20th century go had spread throughout the german and austro hungarian empires in 1905 edward lasker learned the game while in berlin when he moved to new york lasker founded the new york go club together with amongst others arthur smith who had learned of the game in japan while touring the east and had published the book the game of go in 1908 91 93 93 lasker s book go and go moku 1934 helped spread the game throughout the u s 91 93 93 and in 1935 the american go association was formed two years later in 1937 the german go association was founded world war ii put a stop to most go activity since it was a popular game in japan but after the war go continued to spread 91 94 93 for most of the 20th century the japan go association nihon ki in played a leading role in spreading go outside east asia by publishing the english language magazine go review in the 1960s establishing go centers in the u s europe and south america and often sending professional teachers on tour to western nations 91 95 93 internationally the game had been commonly known since the start of the twentieth century by its shortened japanese name and terms for common go concepts are derived from their japanese pronunciation in 1996 nasa astronaut daniel barry and japanese astronaut koichi wakata became the first people to play go in space they used a special go set which was named go space designed by wai cheung willson chow both astronauts were awarded honorary dan ranks by the nihon ki in 91 96 93 as of december 160 2015 91 update 93 the international go federation has 75 member countries with 67 member countries outside east asia 91 97 93 chinese cultural centres across the world are promoting go and cooperating with local go associations for example the seminars held by the chinese cultural centre in tel aviv israel together with the israeli go association 91 98 93 competitive play edit ranks and ratings edit main article go ranks and ratings three japanese professional go players observe some younger amateurs as they dissect a life and death problem in the corner of the board at the us go congress in houston texas 2003 in go rank indicates a player s skill in the game traditionally ranks are measured using kyu and dan grades 91 99 93 a system also adopted by many martial arts more recently mathematical rating systems similar to the elo rating system have been introduced 91 100 93 such rating systems often provide a mechanism for converting a rating to a kyu or dan grade 91 100 93 kyu grades abbreviated k are considered student grades and decrease as playing level increases meaning 1st kyu is the strongest available kyu grade dan grades abbreviated d are considered master grades and increase from 1st dan to 7th dan first dan equals a black belt in eastern martial arts using this system the difference among each amateur rank is one handicap stone for example if a 5k plays a game with a 1k the 5k would need a handicap of four stones to even the odds top level amateur players sometimes defeat professionals in tournament play 91 101 93 professional players have professional dan ranks abbreviated p these ranks are separate from amateur ranks the rank system comprises from the lowest to highest ranks rank type range stage double digit kyu 30 21k beginner double digit kyu 20 10k casual player single digit kyu 9 1k intermediate club player amateur dan 1 7d where 8d is a special title advanced player professional dan 1 9p where 10p is a special title professionals tournament and match rules edit see also go competitions tournament and match rules deal with factors that may influence the game but are not part of the actual rules of play such rules may differ between events rules that influence the game include the setting of compensation points komi handicap and time control parameters rules that do not generally influence the game are the tournament system pairing strategies and placement criteria common tournament systems used in go include the mcmahon system 91 102 93 swiss system league systems and the knockout system tournaments may combine multiple systems many professional go tournaments use a combination of the league and knockout systems 91 103 93 tournament rules may also set the following compensation points called komi which compensate the second player for the first move advantage of their opponent tournaments commonly use a compensation in the range of 5 8 points 91 104 93 generally including a half point to prevent draws handicap stones placed on the board before alternate play allowing players of different strengths to play competitively see go handicap for more information and superko although the basic ko rule described above covers more than 95 of all cycles occurring in games 91 105 93 there are some complex situations triple ko eternal life 91 f 93 etc that are not covered by it but would allow the game to cycle indefinitely to prevent this the ko rule is sometimes extended to forbid the repetition of any previous position this extension is called superko 91 105 93 time control edit see also time control and byoyomi a game of go may be timed using a game clock formal time controls were introduced into the professional game during the 1920s and were controversial 91 106 93 adjournments and sealed moves began to be regulated in the 1930s go tournaments use a number of different time control systems all common systems envisage a single main period of time for each player for the game but they vary on the protocols for continuation in overtime after a player has finished that time allowance 91 g 93 the most widely used time control system is the so called byoyomi 91 h 93 system the top professional go matches have timekeepers so that the players do not have to press their own clocks two widely used variants of the byoyomi system are 91 107 93 standard byoyomi after the main time is depleted a player has a certain number of time periods typically around thirty seconds after each move the number of full time periods that the player took often zero is subtracted for example if a player has three thirty second time periods and takes thirty or more but less than sixty seconds to make a move they lose one time period with 60 89 160 seconds they lose two time periods and so on if however they take less than thirty seconds the timer simply resets without subtracting any periods using up the last period means that the player has lost on time canadian byoyomi after using all of their main time a player must make a certain number of moves within a certain period of time such as twenty moves within five minutes 91 107 93 91 i 93 if the time period expires without the required number of stones having been played then the player has lost on time 91 j 93 notation and recording games edit main article go game record go games are recorded with a simple coordinate system this is comparable to algebraic chess notation except that go stones do not move and thus require only one coordinate per turn coordinate systems include purely numerical 4 4 point hybrid k3 and purely alphabetical 91 108 93 the smart game format uses alphabetical coordinates internally but most editors represent the board with hybrid coordinates as this reduces confusion alternatively the game record can also be noted by writing the successive moves on a diagram where odd numbers mean black stones even numbers mean white stones or conversely when playing with a handicap and a notation like 25 22 in the margin means that the 25th stone was played at the same location as the 22nd one which had been captured in the meantime the japanese word kifu is sometimes used to refer to a game record in unicode go stones can be represented with black and white circles from the block geometric shapes u 25cb x20 x25cb white circle amp cir u 25cf x20 x25cf black circle the block miscellaneous symbols includes go markers 91 109 93 that were likely meant for mathematical research of

professional player of the game of go there are six areas with professional go associations these are china chinese weiqi association japan nihon ki in kansai ki in south korea korea baduk association taiwan taiwan chi yuan culture foundation the united states aga professional system and europe european professional system although the game was developed in china the establishment of the four go houses by tokugawa ieyasu at the start of the 17th century shifted the focus of the go world to japan state sponsorship allowing players to dedicate themselves full time to study of the game and fierce competition between individual houses resulted in a significant increase in the level of play during this period the best player of his generation was given the prestigious title meijin master and the post of godokoro minister of go of special note are the players who were dubbed kisei go sage the only three players to receive this honor were d saku j wa and sh saku all of the house hon inb 91 112 93 hon inb sh sai left last head of house hon inb plays against then up and coming go seigen in the game of the century after the end of the tokugawa shogunate and the meiji restoration period the go houses slowly disappeared and in 1924 the nihon ki in japanese go association was formed top players from this period often played newspaper sponsored matches of 2 10 games 91 113 93 of special note are the chinese born player go seigen chinese wu qingyuan who scored 80 in these matches and beat down most of his opponents to inferior handicaps 91 114 93 and minoru kitani who dominated matches in the early 1930s 91 115 93 these two players are also recognized for their groundbreaking work on new opening theory shinfuseki 91 116 93 for much of the 20th century go continued to be dominated by players trained in japan notable names included eio sakata rin kaiho born in taiwan masao kato koichi kobayashi and cho chikun born cho ch i hun from south korea 91 117 93 top chinese and korean talents often moved to japan because the level of play there was high and funding was more lavish one of the first korean players to do so was cho namchul who studied in the kitani dojo 1937 1944 after his return to korea the hanguk kiwon korea baduk association was formed and caused the level of play in south korea to rise significantly in the second half of the 20th century 91 118 93 in china the game declined during the cultural revolution 1966 1976 but quickly recovered in the last quarter of the 20th century bringing chinese players such as nie weiping and ma xiaochun on par with their japanese and south korean counterparts 91 119 93 the chinese weiqi association today part of the china qiyuan was established in 1962 and professional dan grades started being issued in 1982 91 120 93 western professional go began in 2012 with the american go association s professional system 91 121 93 in 2014 the european go federation followed suit and started their professional system 91 122 93 south korean player lee chang ho plays against russian player alexandre dinerchtein seven time european champion and one of the few non east asian players to reach professional status with the advent of major international titles from 1989 onward it became possible to compare the level of players from different countries more accurately cho hunhyun of south korea won the first edition of the quadrennial ing cup in 1989 his disciple lee chang ho was the dominant player in international go competitions for more than a decade spanning much of 1990s and early 2000s he is also credited with groundbreaking works on the endgame cho lee and other south korean players such as seo bong soo yoo changhyuk and lee sedol between them won the majority of international titles in this period 91 123 93 several chinese players also rose to the top in international go from 2000s most notably ma xiaochun chang hao gu li and ke jie as of 2016 91 update 93 japan lags behind in the international go scene historically more men than women have played go special tournaments for women exist but until recently men and women did not compete together at the highest levels however the creation of new open tournaments and the rise of strong female players most notably rui naiwei have in recent years highlighted the strength and competitiveness of emerging female players 91 124 93 the level in other countries has traditionally been much lower except for some players who had preparatory professional training in east asia 91 k 93 knowledge of the game has been scant elsewhere up until the 20th century a famous player of the 1920s was edward lasker 91 l 93 it was not until the 1950s that more than a few western players took up the game as other than a passing interest in 1978 manfred wimmer became the first westerner to receive a professional player s certificate from an east asian professional go association 91 125 93 in 2000 american michael redmond became the first western player to achieve a 9 dan rank equipment edit main article go equipment go portrayed as part of east asian culture the goblet in the middle is from the nihon ki in it is possible to play go with a simple paper board and coins plastic tokens or white beans and coffee beans for the stones or even by drawing the stones on the board and erasing them when captured more popular midrange equipment includes cardstock a laminated particle board or wood boards with stones of plastic or glass more expensive traditional materials are still used by many players the most expensive go sets have black stones carved from slate and white stones carved from translucent white shells played on boards carved in a single piece from the trunk of a tree traditional equipment edit a traditional japanese set with a solid wooden floor board goban 2 bowls goke and 361 stones goishi boards edit the go board generally referred to by its japanese name goban typically measures between 45 and 48 160 cm 18 and 19 160 in in length from one player s side to the other and 42 to 44 160 cm 16 1 8260 2 to 17 1 8260 4 160 in in width chinese boards are slightly larger as a traditional chinese go stone is slightly larger to match the board is not square there is a 15 14 ratio in length to width because with a perfectly square board from the player s viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board the added length compensates for this 91 126 93 there are two main types of boards a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess and a floor board which is its own free standing table and at which the players sit the traditional japanese goban is between 10 and 18 160 cm 3 9 and 7 1 160 in thick and has legs it sits on the floor see picture 91 126 93 it is preferably made from the rare golden tinged kaya tree torreya nucifera with the very best made from kaya trees up to 700 160 years old more recently the related california torreya torreya californica has been prized for its light color and pale rings as well as its reduced expense and more readily available stock the natural resources of japan have been unable to keep up with the enormous demand for the slow growing kaya trees both t nucifera and t californica take many hundreds of years to grow to the necessary size and they are now extremely rare raising the price of such equipment tremendously 91 127 93 as kaya trees are a protected species in japan they cannot be harvested until they have died thus an old growth floor standing kaya goban can easily cost in excess of 10 000 with the highest quality examples costing more than 60 000 91 128 93 other less expensive woods often used to make quality table boards in both chinese and japanese dimensions include hiba thujopsis dolabrata katsura cercidiphyllum japonicum kauri agathis and shin kaya various varieties of spruce commonly from alaska siberia and china s yunnan province 91 127 93 so called shin kaya is a potentially confusing merchant s term shin means new and thus shin kaya is best translated faux kaya because the woods so described are biologically unrelated to kaya 91 127 93 stones edit a full set of go stones goishi usually contains 181 black stones and 180 white ones a 19 19 grid has 361 points so there are enough stones to cover the board and black gets the extra odd stone because that player goes first however it may happen especially in beginners games that many back and forth captures empty the bowls before the end of the game in that case an exchange of prisoners allows the game to continue traditional japanese stones are double convex and made of clamshell white and slate black 91 129 93 the classic slate is nachiguro stone mined in wakayama prefecture and the clamshell from the hamaguri clam however due to a scarcity in the japanese supply of this clam the stones are most often made of shells harvested from mexico 91 129 93 historically the most prized stones were made of jade often given to the reigning emperor as a gift 91 129 93 in china the game is traditionally played with single convex stones 91 129 93 made of a composite called yunzi the material comes from yunnan province and is made by sintering a proprietary and trade secret mixture of mineral compounds derived from the local stone this process dates to the tang dynasty and after the knowledge was lost in the 1920s during the chinese civil war was rediscovered in the 1960s by the now state run yunzi company the material is praised for its colors its pleasing sound as compared to glass or to synthetics such as melamine and its lower cost as opposed to other materials such as slate shell the term yunzi can also refer to a single convex stone made of any material however most english language go suppliers specify yunzi as a material and single convex as a shape to avoid confusion as stones made of yunzi are also available in double convex while synthetic stones can be either shape traditional stones are made so that black stones are slightly larger in diameter than white this is to compensate for the optical illusion created by contrasting colors that would make equal sized white stones appear larger on the board than black stones 91 129 93 91 m 93 an example of single convex stones and go seigen bowls these particular stones are made of yunzi material and the bowls of jujube wood bowls edit the bowls for the stones are shaped like a flattened sphere with a level underside 91 130 93 the lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game chinese bowls are slightly larger and a little more rounded a style known generally as go seigen japanese kitani bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass such as for brandy the bowls are usually made of turned wood mulberry is the traditional material for japanese bowls but is very expensive wood from the chinese jujube date tree which has a lighter color it is often stained and slightly more visible grain pattern is a common substitute for rosewood and traditional for go seigen style bowls other traditional materials used for making chinese bowls include lacquered wood ceramics stone and woven straw or rattan the names of the bowl shapes go seigen and kitani were introduced in the last quarter of the 20th century by the professional player janice kim as homage to two 20th century professional go players by the same names of chinese and japanese nationality respectively who are referred to as the fathers of modern go 91 112 93 playing technique and etiquette edit go players demonstrating the traditional technique of holding a stone the traditional way to place a go stone is to first take one from the bowl gripping it between the index and middle fingers with the middle finger on top and then placing it directly on the desired intersection 91 131 93 one can also place a stone on the board and then slide it into position under appropriate circumstances where it does not move any other stones it is considered respectful towards white for black to place the first stone of the game in the upper right hand corner 91 132 93 because of symmetry this has no effect on the game s outcome it is considered poor manners to run one s fingers through one s bowl of unplayed stones as the sound however soothing to the player doing this can be disturbing to one s opponent similarly clacking a stone against another stone the board or the table or floor is also discouraged however it is permissible to emphasize select moves by striking the board more firmly than normal thus producing a sharp clack additionally hovering one s arm over the board usually when deciding where to play is also considered rude as it obstructs the opponent s view of the board manners and etiquette are extensively discussed in the classic of weiqi in thirteen chapters a song dynasty manual to the game apart from the points above it also points to the need to remain calm and honorable in maintaining posture and knowing the key specialised terms such as titles of common formations generally speaking much attention is paid to the etiquette of playing as much as to winning or actual game technique computers and go edit main article computer go nature of the game edit see also go and mathematics in combinatorial game theory terms go is a zero sum perfect information partisan deterministic strategy game putting it in the same class as chess draughts checkers and reversi othello however it differs from these in its game play although the rules are simple the practical strategy is complex the game emphasizes the importance of balance on multiple levels to secure an area of the board it is good to play moves close together however to cover the largest area one needs to spread out perhaps leaving weaknesses that can be exploited playing too low close to the edge secures insufficient territory and influence yet playing too high far from the edge allows the opponent to invade decisions in one part of the board may be influenced by an apparently unrelated situation in a distant part of the board for example ladders can be broken by stones at an arbitrary distance away thus plays made early in the game can shape the nature of conflict a hundred moves later the game complexity of go is such that describing even elementary strategy fills many introductory books in fact numerical estimates show that the number of possible games of go far exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe 91 n 93 research of go endgame by john h conway led to the invention of the surreal numbers 91 133 93 go also contributed to development of combinatorial game theory with go infinitesimals 91 134 93 being a specific example of its use in go software players edit main article computer go nudt go long posed a daunting challenge to computer programmers putting forward difficult decision making tasks an intractable search space and an optimal solution so complex it appears infeasible to directly approximate using a policy or value function 91 135 93 prior to 2015 91 135 93 the best go programs only managed to reach amateur dan level 91 136 93 on smaller 9 9 and 13x13 boards computer programs fared better and were able to compare to professional players many in the field of artificial intelligence consider go to require more elements that mimic human thought than chess 91 137 93 a finished beginner s game on a 13 13 board the reasons why computer programs had not played go at the professional dan level prior to 2016 include 91 138 93 the number of spaces on the board is much larger over five times the number of spaces on a chess board 361 vs 64 on most turns there are many more possible moves in go than in chess throughout most of the game the number of legal moves stays at around 150 250 per turn and rarely falls below 100 in chess the average number of moves is 37 91 139 93 because an exhaustive computer program for go must calculate and compare every possible legal move in each ply player turn its ability to calculate the best plays is sharply reduced when there are a large number of possible moves most computer game algorithms such as those for chess compute several moves in advance given an average of 200 available moves through most of the game for a computer to calculate its next move by exhaustively anticipating the next four moves of each possible play two of its own and two of its opponent s it would have to consider more than 320 billion 3 2 1011 possible combinations to exhaustively calculate the next eight moves would require computing 512 quintillion 5 12 1020 possible combinations as of march 160 2014 91 update 93 the most powerful supercomputer in the world nudt s tianhe 2 can sustain 33 86 petaflops 91 140 93 at this rate even given an exceedingly low estimate of 10 operations required to assess the value of one play of a stone tianhe 2 would require four hours to assess all possible combinations of the next eight moves in order to make a single play the placement of a single stone in the initial phase can affect the play of the game a hundred or more moves later a computer would have to predict this influence and it would be unworkable to attempt to exhaustively analyze the next hundred moves in capture based games such as chess a position can often be evaluated relatively easily such as by calculating who has a material advantage or more active pieces 91 o 93 in go there is often no easy way to evaluate a position 91 141 93 however a 6 kyu human can evaluate a position at a glance to see which player has more territory and even beginners can estimate the score within 10 points given time to count it the number of stones on the board material advantage is only a weak indicator of the strength of a position and a territorial advantage more empty points surrounded for one player might be compensated by the opponent s strong positions and influence all over the board normally a 3 dan can easily judge most of these positions as an illustration the greatest handicap normally given to a weaker opponent is 9 stones it was not until august 2008 that a computer won a game against a professional level player at this handicap it was the mogo program which scored this first victory in an exhibition game played during the us go congress 91 142 93 91 143 93 by 2013 a win at the professional level of play was accomplished with a four stone advantage 91 144 93 91 145 93 in october 2015 google deepmind s program

different paradigm than earlier go programs it included very little direct instruction and mostly used deep learning where alphago played itself in hundreds of millions of games such that it could measure positions more intuitively in march 2016 google next challenged lee sedol a 9 dan considered the top player in the world in the early 21st century 91 146 93 to a five game match leading up to

manager with japan airlines 91 169 93 uses go to describe the thinking and behavior of business men psychology edit a 2004 review of literature by fernand gobet de voogt and jean retschitzki shows that relatively little scientific research has been carried out on the psychology of go compared with other traditional board games such as chess 91 170 93 computer go research has shown that given the large search tree knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in go than in other strategy games such as chess 91 170 93 a study of the effects of age on go playing 91 171 93 has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players according to the review of gobet and colleagues the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as pet and fmri does not show large differences between go and chess on the other hand a study by xiangchuan chen et al 91 172 93 showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among go players than among chess players there is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of alzheimer s disease and dementia 91 173 93 science edit in formal game theory terms go is a non chance combinatorial game with perfect information informally that means there are no dice used and decisions or moves create discrete outcome vectors rather than probability distributions the underlying math is combinatorial and all moves via single vertex analysis are visible to both players unlike some card games where some information is hidden perfect information also implies sequence players can theoretically know about all past moves other game theoretical taxonomy elements include the facts that go is bounded because every game must end with a victor or a tie within a finite number of moves the strategy is associative every strategy is a function of board position format is non cooperative not a team sport positions are extensible can be represented by board position trees game is zero sum player choices do not increase resources available colloquially rewards in the game are fixed and if one player wins the other loses and the utility function is restricted in the sense of win lose however ratings monetary rewards national and personal pride and other factors can extend utility functions but generally not to the extent of removing the win lose restriction affine transformations can theoretically add non zero and complex utility aspects even to two player games 91 174 93 in the endgame it can often happen that the state of the board consists of several subpositions that do not interact with the others the whole board position can then be considered as a mathematical sum or composition of the individual subpositions 91 175 93 it is this property of go endgames that led john horton conway to the discovery of surreal numbers 91 133 93 comparisons edit go begins with an empty board it is focused on building from the ground up nothing to something with multiple simultaneous battles leading to a point based win chess is tactical rather than strategic as the predetermined strategy is to trap one individual piece the king this comparison has also been applied to military and political history with scott boorman s book the protracted game 1969 and more recently robert greene s book the 48 laws of power 1998 exploring the strategy of the chinese communist party in the chinese civil war through the lens of go 91 176 93 91 177 93 a similar comparison has been drawn among go chess and backgammon perhaps the three oldest games that enjoy worldwide popularity 91 178 93 backgammon is a man vs fate contest with chance playing a strong role in determining the outcome chess with rows of soldiers marching forward to capture each other embodies the conflict of man vs man because the handicap system tells go players where they stand relative to other players an honestly ranked player can expect to lose about half of their games therefore go can be seen as embodying the quest for self improvement man vs self 91 178 93 see also edit go portal go opening strategy go variants games played with go equipment xiangqi pente notes edit game complexity can be difficult to estimate the number of legal positions state space complexity for chess has been estimated at anywhere between 1043 to 1050 in 2016 the number of legal positions for 19x19 go was calculated by tromp and farneback at 2 08 10170 alternately a measure of all the alternatives to be considered at each stage of the game game tree complexity can be estimated with bd where b is the game s breadth number of legal moves per position and d is its depth number of moves or plies per game for chess and go the comparison is very roughly 3580 250150 or 10123 10360 91 13 93 eyes and other complications may need to be considered when counting liberties exceptionally in japanese and korean rules empty points even those surrounded by stones of a single color may count as neutral territory if some of them are alive by seki see the section below on seki in game theoretical terms seki positions are an example of a nash equilibrium whether or not a group is weak or strong refers to the ease with which it can be killed or made to live see this article by benjamin teuber amateur 6 dan for some views on how important this is felt to be a full explanation of the eternal life position can be found on sensei s library it also appears in the official text for japanese rules see translation roughly one has the time to play the game and then a little time to finish it off time wasting tactics are possible in go so that sudden death systems in which time runs out at a predetermined point however many plays are in the game are relatively unpopular in the west literally in japanese by yomi means reading of seconds typically players stop the clock and the player in overtime sets his her clock for the desired interval counts out the required number of stones and sets the remaining stones out of reach so as not to become confused if twenty moves are made in time the timer is reset to five minutes again in other words canadian byoyomi is essentially a standard chess style time control based on n moves in a time period t imposed after a main period is used up it is possible to decrease t or increase n as each overtime period expires but systems with constant t and n for example 20 plays in 5 160 minutes are widely used kaku takagawa toured europe around 1970 and reported go review a general standard of amateur 4 dan this is a good amateur level but no more than might be found in ordinary east asian clubs published current european ratings would suggest around 100 players stronger than that with very few european 7 dans european go has been documented by franco pratesi eurogo florence 2003 in three volumes up to 1920 1920 1950 and 1950 and later see overshoot in western typography for similar subtle adjustment to create a uniform appearance it has been said that the number of board positions is at most 3361 about 10172 since each position can be white black or vacant ignoring illegal suicide moves there are at least 361 games about 10768 since every permutation of the 361 points corresponds to a game see go and mathematics for more details which includes much larger estimates this estimate however is inexact for two reasons first both contestants usually agree to end the game long before every point has been played second after a capture it may happen that an already played point is played again even repetitively so in the case of a k battle while chess position evaluation is simpler than go position evaluation it is still more complicated than simply calculating material advantage or piece activity pawn structure and king safety matter as do the possibilities in further play the complexity of the algorithm differs per engine 91 citation needed 93 lists of such programs may be found at
