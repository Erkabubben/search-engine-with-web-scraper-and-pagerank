virtual assistant from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search mobile software agent for the human occupation see virtual assistant occupation not to be confused with personal digital assistant google assistant running on a pixel xl smartphone apple tv remote control with which users can ask siri the virtual assistant to find content to watch amazon echo smart speaker running the alexa virtual assistant an intelligent virtual assistant iva or intelligent personal assistant ipa is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions the term chatbot is sometimes used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically accessed by online chat in some cases online chat programs are exclusively for entertainment purposes some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices users can ask their assistants questions control home automation devices and media playback via voice and manage other basic tasks such as email to do lists and calendars with verbal commands 91 1 93 a similar concept however with differences lays under the dialogue systems 91 2 93 as of 2017 the capabilities and usage of virtual assistants are expanding rapidly with new products entering the market and a strong emphasis on both email and voice user interfaces apple and google have large installed bases of users on smartphones microsoft has a large installed base of windows based personal computers smartphones and smart speakers amazon has a large install base for smart speakers 91 3 93 conversica has over 100 million engagements via its email and sms interface intelligent virtual assistants for business now the virtual assistant does not refer only to a machine but a person whose primary job is to help his employer to do a specific online job virtually most of time this person is residing in another part of the world contents 1 history 1 1 experimental decades

decades 1910s 1980s edit radio rex was the first voice activated toy released in 1922 91 4 93 it was a wooden toy in the shape of a dog that would come out of its house when its name is called in 1952 bell labs presented audrey the automatic digit recognition machine it occupied a six foot high relay rack consumed substantial power had streams of cables and exhibited the myriad maintenance problems associated with complex vacuum tube circuitry it could recognize the fundamental units of speech phonemes it was limited to accurate recognition of digits spoken by designated talkers it could therefore be used for voice dialing but in most cases push button dialing was cheaper and faster rather than speaking the consecutive digits 91 5 93 another early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the ibm shoebox voice activated calculator presented to the general public during the 1962 seattle world s fair after its initial market launch in 1961 this early computer developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first ibm personal computer in 1981 was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9 the first natural language processing computer program or the chatbot eliza was developed by mit professor joseph weizenbaum in the 1960s it was created to demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial 91 6 93 eliza used pattern matching and substitution methodology into scripted responses to simulate conversation which gave an illusion of understanding on the part of the program weizenbaum s own secretary reportedly asked weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and eliza could have a real conversation weizenbaum was surprised by this later writing i had not realized that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people 91 7 93 this gave name to the eliza effect the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors that is anthropomorphisation a phenomenon present in human interactions with virtual assistants the next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania with substantial support of the united states department of defense and its darpa agency funded five years of a speech understanding research program aiming to reach a minimum vocabulary of 1 000 words companies and academia including ibm carnegie mellon university cmu and stanford research institute took part in the program the result was harpy it mastered about 1000 words the vocabulary of a three year old and it could understand sentences it could process speech that followed pre programmed vocabulary pronunciation and grammar structures to determine which sequences of words made sense together and thus reducing speech recognition errors in 1986 tangora was an upgrade of the shoebox it was a voice recognizing typewriter named after the world s fastest typist at the time it had a vocabulary of 20 000 words and used prediction to decide the most likely result based on what was said in the past ibm s approach was based on a hidden markov model which adds statistics to digital signal processing techniques the method makes it possible to predict the most likely phonemes to follow a given phoneme still each speaker had to individually train the typewriter to recognize his or her voice and pause between each word birth of smart virtual assistants 1990s present edit in the 1990s digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with ibm philips and lernout amp hauspie fighting for customers much later the market launch of the first smartphone ibm simon in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today in 1997 dragon s naturally speaking software could recognize and transcribe natural human speech without pauses between each word into a document at a rate of 100 words per minute a version of naturally speaking is still available for download and it is still used today for instance by many doctors in the us and the uk to document their medical records in 2001 colloquis publicly launched smarterchild on platforms like aim and msn messenger while entirely text based smarterchild was able to play games check the weather look up facts and converse with users to an extent 91 8 93 the first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was siri which was introduced as a feature of the iphone 4s on 4 october 2011 91 9 93 apple inc developed siri following the 2010 acquisition of siri inc a spin off of sri international which is a research institute financed by darpa and the united states department of defense 91 10 93 its aim was to aid in tasks such as sending a text message making phone calls checking the weather or setting up an alarm over time it has developed to provide restaurant recommendations search the internet and provide driving directions in november 2014 amazon announced alexa alongside the echo in april 2017 amazon released a service for building conversational interfaces for any type of virtual assistant or interface method of interaction edit virtual assistants work via text including online chat especially in an instant messaging application or other application sms text e mail or other text based communication channel for example conversica s intelligent virtual assistants for business 91 11 93 voice for example with amazon alexa 91 12 93 on the amazon echo device siri on an iphone or google assistant on google enabled android mobile devices by taking and or uploading images as in the case of samsung bixby on the samsung galaxy s8 some virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods such as google assistant via chat on the google allo and google messages app and via voice on google home smart speakers virtual assistants use natural language processing nlp to match user text or voice input to executable commands many continually learn using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning and ambient intelligence some of these assistants like google assistant which contains google lens and samsung bixby also have the added ability to do image processing to recognize objects in the image to help the users get better results from the clicked images to activate a virtual assistant using the voice a wake word might be used this is a word or groups of words such as hey siri ok google or hey google alexa and hey microsoft 91 13 93 as virtual assistants become more popular there are increasing legal risks involved 91 14 93 58 8202 815 8202 devices and objects where found edit virtual assistants may be integrated into many types of platforms or like amazon alexa across several of them into devices like smart speakers such as amazon echo google home and apple homepod in instant messaging applications on both smartphones and via the web e g facebook s m virtual assistant on both facebook and facebook messenger apps or via the web built into a mobile operating system os as are apple s siri on ios devices and blackberry assistant on blackberry 10 devices or into a desktop os such as cortana on microsoft windows os built into a smartphone independent of the os as is bixby on the samsung galaxy s8 and note 8 91 15 93 within instant messaging platforms assistants from specific organizations such as aeromexico s aerobot on facebook messenger or wechat secretary on wechat within mobile apps from specific companies and other organizations such as dom from domino s pizza 91 16 93 in appliances 91 17 93 cars 91 18 93 and wearable technology 91 19 93 previous generations of virtual assistants often worked on websites such as alaska airlines ask jenn 91 20 93 or on interactive voice response ivr systems such as american airlines ivr by nuance 91 21 93 services edit virtual assistants can provide a wide variety of services these include 91 22 93 provide information such as weather facts from e g wikipedia or imdb set an alarm make to do lists and shopping lists play music from streaming services such as spotify and pandora play radio stations read audiobooks play videos tv shows or movies on televisions streaming from e g netflix conversational commerce see below assist public interactions with government see artificial intelligence in government complement and or replace customer service by humans 91 23 93 one report estimated that an automated online assistant produced a 30 decrease in the work load for a human provided call centre 91 24 93 in car voice assistants interaction with virtual assistants like siri and alexa has become common today it allows people to get more comfortable and have an exceptional driving experience conversational commerce edit main article conversational commerce conversational commerce is e commerce via various means of messaging including via voice assistants 91 25 93 but also live chat on e commerce web sites live chat on messaging applications such as wechat facebook messenger and whatsapp 91 26 93 and chatbots on messaging applications or web sites customer support edit main article customer support a virtual assistant can work with customer support team of a business to provide 24x7 support to customers it provides quick responses which enhances a customer s experience third party services edit amazon enables alexa skills and google actions essentially applications that run on the assistant platforms virtual assistant privacy edit main article virtual assistant privacy virtual assistants have a variety of privacy concerns associated with them features such as activation by voice pose a threat as such features requires the device to always be listening 91 27 93 modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants 91 28 93 privacy policy of prominent virtual assistants edit google assistant edit the privacy policy of google assistant states that it does not store the audio data without the user s permission but may store the conversation transcripts to personalise its experience personalisation can be turned off in settings if a user wants google assistant to store audio data they can go to voice amp audio activity vaa and turn on this feature audio files are sent to the cloud and used by google to improve the performance of google assistant but only if the vaa feature is turned on 91 29 93 amazon s alexa edit the privacy policy of amazon s virtual assistant alexa states that it only listens to conversations when its wake word like alexa amazon echo is used it starts recording the conversation after the call of a wake word and stops recording after 8 seconds of silence it sends the recorded conversation to the cloud it is possible to delete the recording from the cloud by visiting alexa privacy in alexa 91 30 93 apple s siri edit apple states that it does not record audio to improve siri instead it uses transcripts transcript data is only sent if it is deemed important for analysis users can opt out anytime if they don t want siri to send the transcripts in the cloud 91 31 93 presumed and observed interest for the consumer edit presumed added value as allowing a new way of interactions edit added value of the virtual assistants can come among others from the following voice communication can sometimes represent the optimal man machine communication it is convenient there are some sectors where voice is the only way of possible communication and more generally it allows to free up both hands and vision potentially for doing another activity in parallel or helps also disabled people it is faster voice is more efficient than writing on a keyboard we can speak up to 200 words per minute opposed to 60 in case of writing on a keyboard it is also more natural thus requiring less effort reading a text however can reach 700 words per minute 91 32 93 virtual assistants save a lot of time by automation they can take appointments or read the news while the consumer does something else it is also possible to ask the virtual assistant to schedule meetings hence helping to organize time the designers of new digital schedulers explained the ambition they had that these calendars schedule lives to make the consumer use his time more efficiently through machine learning processes and complete organization of work time and free time as an example when the consumer expresses the desire of scheduling a break the va will schedule it at an optimal moment for this purpose for example at a time of the week where they are less productive with the additional long term objective of being able to schedule and organize the free time of the consumer to assure them optimal work efficiency 91 33 93 perceived interest edit graphical sum up of the study capturing reasons of interest of virtual assistants for consumers according to a recent study 2019 the two reasons for using virtual assistants for consumers are perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment the first result of this study is that both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have an equivalent very strong influence for the consumer willingness to use a virtual assistant the second result of this study is that provided content quality has a very strong influence on perceived usefulness and a strong influence on perceived enjoyment visual attractiveness has a very strong influence on perceived enjoyment automation has a strong influence on perceived usefulness 91 34 93 controversies edit artificial intelligence controversies edit virtual assistants spur the filter bubble as for social media virtual assistants algorithms are trained to show pertinent data and discard others based on previous activities of the consumer the pertinent data is the one which will interest or please the consumer as a result they become isolated from data that disagrees with their viewpoints effectively isolating them into their own intellectual bubble and reinforcing their opinions this phenomenon was known to reinforce fake news and echo chambers 91 35 93 virtual assistants are also sometimes criticized for being overrated in particular a casilli points out that the ai of virtual assistants are neither intelligent nor artificial for two reasons not intelligent because all they do is being the assistant of the human and only by doing tasks that a human could do easily and in a very limited specter of actions find class and present information offers or documents also virtual assistants are neither able to make decisions on their own nor to anticipate things and not artificial because they would be impossible without human labelization through micro working 91 36 93 ethics implications edit in 2019 antonio a casilli a french sociologist criticized artificial intelligence and virtual assistants in particular in the following way at a first level the fact that the consumer provides free data for the training and improvement of the virtual assistant often without knowing it is ethically disturbing but at a second level it might be even more ethically disturbing to know how these ais are trained with this data this artificial intelligence is trained via neural networks which require a huge amount of labelled data however this data needs to be labelled through a human process which explains the rise of microwork in the last decade that is remotely using some people worldwide doing some repetitive and very simple tasks for a few cents such as listening to virtual assistant speech data and writing down what was said microwork has been criticized for the job insecurity it causes and for the total lack of regulation the average salary was 1 38 dollar hour in 2010 91 37 93 and it provides neither healthcare nor retirement benefits sick pay minimum wage hence virtual assistants and their designers are controversial for spurring job insecurity and the ais they propose are still human in the way that they would be impossible without the microwork of millions of human workers 91 36 93 privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of virtual assistants in unencrypted form and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner 91 38 93 additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech a user s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity personality traits body shape physical and mental health condition sex gender moods and emotions socioeconomic status and geographical origin 91 39 93 developer platforms edit notable developer platforms for virtual assistants include amazon lex was opened to developers in april 2017 it involves natural language understanding technology combined with automatic speech recognition and had been introduced in november 2016 91 40 93 google provides the actions on google and dialogflow platforms for developers to create actions for google assistant 91 41 93 apple provides sirikit for developers to create extensions for siri ibm s watson while sometimes spoken of as a virtual assistant is in fact an entire artificial intelligence platform and community powering some virtual assistants chatbots and many other types of solutions 91 42 93 91 43 93 previous generations edit in previous generations of text chat based virtual assistants the assistant was often represented by an avatar a k a interactive online character or automated character this was known as an embodied agent economic relevance edit for individuals edit digital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status weight comparable to real experiences if not become more sought after and prized 91 44 93 the trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants in mid 2017 the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around 1 bn worldwide 91 45 93 in addition it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications but present across many industry sectors incl automotive telecommunications retail healthcare and education 91 46 93 in response to the significant r amp d expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a cagr of 34 9 globally over the period of 2016 to 2024 and thereby surpass a global market size of us 7 5 billion by 2024 91 46 93 according to an ovum study the native digital assistant installed base is projected to exceed the world s population by 2021 with 7 5 billion active voice ai capable devices 91 47 93 according to ovum by that time google assistant will dominate the voice ai capable device market with 23 3 market share followed by samsung s bixby 14 5 apple s siri 13 1 amazon s alexa 3 9 and microsoft s cortana 2 3 91 47 93 taking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders north american companies e g nuance communications ibm egain are expected to dominate the industry over the next years due to the significant impact of byod bring your own device and enterprise mobility business models furthermore the increasing demand for smartphone assisted platforms are expected to further boost the north american intelligent virtual assistant iva industry growth despite its smaller size in comparison to the north american market the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the asia pacific region with its main players located in india and china is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 40 above global average over the 2016 2024 period 91 46 93 economic opportunity for enterprises edit virtual assistants should not be only seen as a gadget for individuals as they could have a real economic utility for enterprises as an example a virtual assistant can take the role of an always available assistant with an encyclopedic knowledge and which can organize meetings check inventories verify informations virtual assistants are all the more important that their integration in small and middle sized enterprises often consists in an easy first step through the more global adaptation and use of internet of things iot indeed iot technologies are first perceived by small and medium sized enterprises as technologies of critical importance but too complicated risky or costly to be used 91 48 93 security edit in may 2018 researchers from the university of california berkeley published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it 91 49 93 the researchers made small changes to audio files which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect these were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers open websites or even transfer money 91 49 93 the possibility of this has been known since 2016 91 49 93 and affects devices from apple amazon and google 91 50 93 in addition to unintentional actions and voice recording another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands an attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to for example unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user s knowledge although some ivas provide a voice training feature to prevent such impersonation it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices thus a malicious person who is able to access an iva enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that they are the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts 91 51
