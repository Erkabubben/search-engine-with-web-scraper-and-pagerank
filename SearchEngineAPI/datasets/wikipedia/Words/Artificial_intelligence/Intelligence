intelligence from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search ability to perceive infer retain or apply information for the human faculty of thinking and understanding see intellect for human intelligence see human intelligence for other uses see intelligence disambiguation intelligence has been defined in many ways the capacity for abstraction logic understanding self awareness learning emotional knowledge reasoning planning creativity critical thinking and problem solving more generally it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context intelligence is most often studied in humans but has also been observed in both non human animals and in plants despite controversy as to whether some of these forms of life exhibit intelligence 91 1 93 91 2 93 intelligence in computers or other machines is called artificial intelligence contents 1

external links etymology main article nous the word intelligence derives from the latin nouns intelligentia or intell ctus which in turn stem from the verb intelligere to comprehend or perceive in the middle ages the word intellectus became the scholarly technical term for understanding and a translation for the greek philosophical term nous this term however was strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism including theories of the immortality of the soul and the concept of the active intellect also known as the active intelligence this approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as francis bacon thomas hobbes john locke and david hume all of whom preferred understanding in place of intellectus or intelligence in their english philosophical works 91 3 93 91 4 93 hobbes for example in his latin de corpore used intellectus intelligit translated in the english version as the understanding understandeth as a typical example of a logical absurdity 91 5 93 intelligence has therefore become less common in english language philosophy but it has later been taken up with the scholastic theories which it now implies in more contemporary psychology 91 6 93 definitions the definition of intelligence is controversial varying in what its abilities are and whether or not it is quantifiable 91 7 93 some groups of psychologists have suggested the following definitions from mainstream science on intelligence 1994 an op ed statement in the wall street journal signed by fifty two researchers out of 131 total invited to sign 91 8 93 a very general mental capability that among other things involves the ability to reason plan solve problems think abstractly comprehend complex ideas learn quickly and learn from experience it is not merely book learning a narrow academic skill or test taking smarts rather it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings catching on making sense of things or figuring out what to do 91 9 93 from intelligence knowns and unknowns 1995 a report published by the board of scientific affairs of the american psychological association individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas to adapt effectively to the environment to learn from experience to engage in various forms of reasoning to overcome obstacles by taking thought although these individual differences can be substantial they are never entirely consistent a given person s intellectual performance will vary on different occasions in different domains as judged by different criteria concepts of intelligence are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions and none commands universal assent indeed when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define intelligence they gave two dozen somewhat different definitions 91 10 93 besides those definitions psychology and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as the following researcher quotation alfred binet judgment otherwise called good sense practical sense initiative the faculty of adapting one s self to circumstances auto critique 91 11 93 david wechsler the aggregate or global capacity of the individual to act purposefully to think rationally and to deal effectively with his environment 91 12 93 lloyd humphreys the resultant of the process of acquiring storing in memory retrieving combining comparing and using in new contexts information and conceptual skills 91 13 93 howard gardner to my mind a human intellectual competence must entail a set of skills of problem solving enabling the individual to resolve genuine problems or difficulties that he or she encounters and when appropriate to create an effective product and must also entail the potential for finding or creating problems and thereby laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new knowledge 91 14 93 linda gottfredson the ability to deal with cognitive complexity 91 15 93 robert sternberg amp william salter goal directed adaptive behavior 91 16 93 reuven feuerstein the theory of structural cognitive modifiability describes intelligence as the unique propensity of human beings to change or modify the structure of their cognitive functioning to adapt to the changing demands of a life situation 91 17 93 shane legg amp marcus hutter a synthesis of 70 definitions from psychology philosophy and ai researchers intelligence measures an agent s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments 91 7 93 which has been mathematically formalized 91 18 93 alexander wissner gross f t s x03c4 displaystyle tau 91 19 93 intelligence is a force f that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action it acts to maximize future freedom of action or keep options open with some strength t with the diversity of possible accessible futures s up to some future time horizon in short intelligence doesn t like to get trapped human main article human intelligence human intelligence is the intellectual power of humans which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self awareness 91 20 93 intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors it is a cognitive process it gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn form concepts understand and reason including the capacities to recognize patterns innovate plan solve problems and employ language to communicate intelligence enables humans to experience and think 91 21 93 intelligence is different from learning learning refers to the act of retaining facts and information or abilities and being able to recall them for future use while intelligence is the cognitive ability of someone to perform these and other processes there have been various attempts to quantify intelligence via testing such as the intelligence quotient iq test however many people disagree with the validity of iq tests stating that they cannot accurately measure intelligence 91 22 93 there is debate about if human intelligence is based on hereditary factors or if it is based on environmental factors hereditary intelligence is the theory that intelligence is fixed upon birth and not able to grow environmental intelligence is the theory that intelligence is developed throughout life depending on the environment around the person an environment that cultivates intelligence is one that challenges the person s cognitive abilities 91 22 93 much of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of non human animals 91 citation needed 93 emotional main article emotional intelligence emotional intelligence is thought to be the ability to convey emotion to others in an understandable way as well as to read the emotions of others accurately 91 23 93 some theories imply that a heightened emotional intelligence could also lead to faster generating and processing of emotions in addition to the accuracy 91 24 93 in addition higher emotional intelligence is thought to help us manage emotions which is beneficial for our problem solving skills emotional intelligence is important to our mental health and has ties into social intelligence 91 23 93 social main article social intelligence social intelligence is the ability to understand the social cues and motivations of others and oneself in social situations it is thought to be distinct to other types of intelligence but has relations to emotional intelligence social intelligence has coincided with other studies that focus on how we make judgements of others the accuracy with which we do so and why people would be viewed as having positive or negative social character there is debate as to whether or not these studies and social intelligence come from the same theories or if there is a distinction between them and they are generally thought to be of two different schools of thought 91 25 93 book smart and street smart concepts of book smarts and street smart are contrasting views based on the premise that some people have knowledge gained through academic study but may lack the experience to sensibly apply that knowledge while others have knowledge gained through practical experience but may lack accurate information usually gained through study by which to effectively apply that knowledge artificial intelligence researcher hector levesque has noted that given the importance of learning through text in our own personal lives and in our culture it is perhaps surprising how utterly dismissive we tend to be of it it is sometimes derided as being merely book knowledge and having it is being book smart in contrast knowledge acquired through direct experience and apprenticeship is called street knowledge and having it is being street smart 91 26 93 nonhuman animal main article animal cognition the common chimpanzee can use tools this chimpanzee is using a stick to get food although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence or more broadly animal cognition these researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species and comparing abilities between species they study various measures of problem solving as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it has the same meaning across species e g comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals and also operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts 91 citation needed 93 wolfgang k hler s research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area stanley coren s book the intelligence of dogs is a notable book on the topic of dog intelligence 91 27 93 see also dog intelligence non human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees bonobos notably the language using kanzi and other great apes dolphins elephants and to some extent parrots rats and ravens 91 28 93 cephalopod intelligence also provides an important comparative study cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals vertebrates such as mammals birds reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species the same is true with arthropods 91 29 93 g factor in non humans main article g factor in non humans evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non human animals the general factor of intelligence or g factor is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual s scores on a wide range of cognitive abilities first described in humans the g factor has since been identified in a number of non human species 91 30 93 cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same largely verbally dependent scales developed for humans instead intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation habit reversal social learning and responses to novelty studies have shown that g is responsible for 47 of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates 91 30 93 and between 55 and 60 of the variance in mice locurto locurto these values are similar to the accepted variance in iq explained by g in humans 40 50 91 31 93 plant main articles plant perception physiology 160 plant cognition and plant cognition it has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure self preservation and reproduction 91 32 93 91 33 93 a counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning if this is accepted as definitive of intelligence then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of machine learning but excludes those purely autonomic sense reaction responses that can be observed in many plants plants are not limited to automated sensory motor responses however they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning registering memories from their past experiences they are also capable of communication accurately computing their circumstances using sophisticated cost benefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors 91 1 93 91 2 93 91 34 93 artificial main article artificial intelligence scholars studying artificial intelligence have proposed definitions of intelligence that include the intelligence demonstrated by machines some of these definitions are meant to be general enough to encompass human and other animal intelligence as well an intelligent agent can be defined as a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success 91 35 93 kaplan and haenlein define artificial intelligence as a system s ability to correctly interpret external data to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation 91 36 93 progress in artificial intelligence can be demonstrated in benchmarks ranging from games to practical tasks such as protein folding 91 37 93 existing ai lags humans in terms of general intelligence which is sometimes defined as the capacity to learn how to carry out a huge range of tasks 91 38 93 singularitarian eliezer yudkowsky provides a loose qualitative definition of intelligence as that sort of smartish stuff coming out of brains which can play chess and price bonds and persuade people to buy bonds and invent guns and figure out gravity by looking at wandering lights in the sky and which if a machine intelligence had it in large quantities might let it invent molecular nanotechnology and so on mathematician olle h ggstr m defines intelligence in terms of optimization power an agent s capacity for efficient cross domain optimization of the world according to the agent s preferences or more simply the ability to steer the future into regions of possibility 160 ranked high in a preference ordering in this optimization framework deep blue has the power to steer a chessboard s future into a subspace of possibility which it labels as winning despite attempts by garry kasparov to steer the future elsewhere 91 39 93 hutter and legg after surveying the literature define intelligence as an agent s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments 91 40 93 91 41 93 while cognitive ability is sometimes measured as a one dimensional parameter it could also be represented as a hypersurface in a multidimensional space to compare systems that are good at different intellectual tasks 91 42 93 some skeptics believe that there is no meaningful way to define intelligence aside from just pointing to ourselves 91 43 93 see also philosophy portalpsychology portal active intellect cattell horn carroll theory intellect intelligence journal knowledge neuroscience and intelligence noogenesis outline
