science categoryvte the history of artificial intelligence ai began in antiquity with myths stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen the seeds of modern ai were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols this work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning this device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain the field of ai research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of dartmouth college usa during the summer of 1956 91 1 93 those who attended would become the leaders of ai research for decades many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true 91 2 93 eventually it became obvious that commercial developers and researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project 91 3 93 in 1974 in response to the criticism from james lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress the u s and british governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an ai winter seven years later a visionary initiative by the japanese government inspired governments and industry to provide ai with billions of dollars but by the late 80s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again investment and interest in ai boomed in the first decades of the 21st century when machine learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods the application of powerful computer hardware and the collection of immense data sets contents 1 precursors 1 1 mythical fictional

mythical fictional and speculative precursors edit myth and legend edit in greek mythology talos was a giant constructed of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of crete he would throw boulders at the ships of invaders and would complete 3 circuits around the island s perimeter daily 91 4 93 according to pseudo apollodorus bibliotheke hephaestus forged talos with the aid of a cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to minos 91 5 93 in the argonautica jason and the argonauts defeated him by way of a single plug near his foot which once removed allowed the vital ichor to flow out from his body and left him inanimate 91 6 93 pygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of greek mythology famously represented in ovid s metamorphoses in the 10th book of ovid s narrative poem pygmalion becomes disgusted with women when he witnesses the way in which the propoetides prostitute themselves 91 7 93 despite this he makes offerings at the temple of venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just like a statue he carved the earliest written account regarding golem making is found in the writings of eleazar ben judah of worms circa 12 13th century 91 8 93 91 9 93 during the middle ages it was believed that the animation of a golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of paper with any of god s names on it into the mouth of the clay figure 91 10 93 unlike legendary automata like brazen heads 91 11 93 a golem was unable to speak 91 12 93 alchemical means of artificial intelligence edit depiction of a homunculus from goethe s faust in of the nature of things written by the swiss born alchemist paracelsus he describes a procedure which he claims can fabricate an artificial man by placing the sperm of a man in horse dung and feeding it the arcanum of mans blood after 40 days the concoction will become a living infant 91 13 93 takwin the artificial creation of life was a frequent topic of ismaili alchemical manuscripts especially those attributed to jabir ibn hayyan islamic alchemists attempted to create a broad range of life through their work ranging from plants to animals 91 14 93 in faust the second part of the tragedy by johann wolfgang von goethe an alchemically fabricated homunculus destined to live forever in the flask in which he was made endeavors to be born into a full human body upon the initiation of this transformation however the flask shatters and the homunculus dies 91 15 93 modern fiction edit main article artificial intelligence in fiction by the 19th century ideas about artificial men and thinking machines were developed in fiction as in mary shelley s frankenstein or karel apek s r u r rossum s universal robots 91 16 93 and speculation such as samuel butler s darwin among the machines 91 17 93 and in real world instances including edgar allan poe s maelzel s chess player 91 18 93 ai has become a regular topic of science fiction through the present 91 19 93 automata edit main article automaton al jazari s programmable automata 1206 ce realistic humanoid automata were built by craftsman from every civilization including yan shi 91 20 93 hero of alexandria 91 21 93 al jazari 91 22 93 pierre jaquet droz and wolfgang von kempelen 91 23 93 the oldest known automata were the sacred statues of ancient egypt and greece 91 24 93 the faithful believed that craftsman had imbued these figures with very real minds capable of wisdom and emotion hermes trismegistus wrote that by discovering the true nature of the gods man has been able to reproduce it 91 25 93 91 26 93 during the early modern period these legendary automata were said to possess the magical ability to answer questions put to them the late medieval alchemist and scholar roger bacon was purported to have fabricated a brazen head having developed a legend of having been a wizard 91 27 93 these legends were similar to the norse myth of the head of m mir according to legend m mir was known for his intellect and wisdom and was beheaded in the sir vanir war odin is said to have embalmed the head with herbs and spoke incantations over it such that m mir s head remained able to speak wisdom to odin odin then kept the head near him for counsel 91 28 93 formal reasoning edit artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized the study of mechanical or formal reasoning has a long history chinese indian and greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction in the first millennium bce their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as aristotle who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism euclid whose elements was a model of formal reasoning al khw rizm who developed algebra and gave his name to algorithm and european scholastic philosophers such as william of ockham and duns scotus 91 29 93 spanish philosopher ramon llull 1232 1315 developed several logical machines devoted to the production of knowledge by logical means 91 30 93 llull described his machines as mechanical entities that could combine basic and undeniable truths by simple logical operations produced by the machine by mechanical meanings in such ways as to produce all the possible knowledge 91 31 93 llull s work had a great influence on gottfried leibniz who redeveloped his ideas 91 32 93 gottfried leibniz who speculated that human reason could be reduced to mechanical calculation in the 17th century leibniz thomas hobbes and ren descartes explored the possibility that all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry 91 33 93 hobbes famously wrote in leviathan reason is nothing but reckoning 91 34 93 leibniz envisioned a universal language of reasoning the characteristica universalis which would reduce argumentation to calculation so that there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants for it would suffice to take their pencils in hand down to their slates and to say each other with a friend as witness if they liked let us calculate 91 35 93 these philosophers had begun to articulate the physical symbol system hypothesis that would become the guiding faith of ai research in the 20th century the study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible the foundations had been set by such works as boole s the laws of thought and frege s begriffsschrift building on frege s system russell and whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece the principia mathematica in 1913 inspired by russell s success david hilbert challenged mathematicians of the 1920s and 30s to answer this fundamental question can all of mathematical reasoning be formalized 91 29 93 his question was answered by g del s incompleteness proof turing s machine and church s lambda calculus 91 29 93 91 36 93 us army photo of the eniac at the moore school of electrical engineering 91 37 93 their answer was surprising in two ways first they proved that there were in fact limits to what mathematical logic could accomplish but second and more important for ai their work suggested that within these limits any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized the church turing thesis implied that a mechanical device shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction the key insight was the turing machine a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation 91 38 93 this invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines 91 29 93 91 39 93 computer science edit main articles history of computer hardware and history of computer science calculating machines were built in antiquity and improved throughout history by many mathematicians including once again philosopher gottfried leibniz in the early 19th century charles babbage designed a programmable computer the analytical engine although it was never built 91 40 93 ada lovelace speculated that the machine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent 91 41 93 she is often credited as the first programmer because of a set of notes she wrote that completely detail a method for calculating bernoulli numbers with the engine following babbage although at first unaware of his earlier work was percy ludgate a clerk to a corn merchant in dublin ireland he independently designed a programmable mechanical computer which he described in a work that was published in 1909 91 42 93 91 43 93 two other inventors leonardo torres y quevedo and vannevar bush also did follow on research based on babbage s work in his essays on automatics 1913 torres designed a babbage type of calculating machine that used electromechanical parts which included floating point number representations and built a prototype in 1920 91 44 93 torres is also known for having built in 1912 an autonomous machine capable of playing chess el ajedrecista as opposed to the human operated the turk and ajeeb el ajedrecista the chessplayer was a true automaton which could play chess without human guidance it only played an endgame with three chess pieces automatically moving a white king and a rook to checkmate the black king moved by a human opponent 91 45 93 91 46 93 vannevar bush s paper instrumental analysis 1936 discussed using existing ibm punch card machines to implement babbage s design in the same year he started the rapid arithmetical machine project to investigate the problems of constructing an electronic digital computer 91 44 93 the first modern computers were the massive code breaking machines of the second world war such as z3 eniac and colossus the latter two of these machines were based on the theoretical foundation laid by alan turing 91 47 93 and developed by john von neumann 91 48 93 the birth of artificial intelligence 1952 1956 edit the ibm 702 a computer used by the first generation of ai researchers in the 1940s and 50s a handful of scientists from a variety of fields mathematics psychology engineering economics and political science began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain the field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 91 49 93 cybernetics and early neural networks edit the earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s 1940s and early 1950s recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all or nothing pulses norbert wiener s cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks claude shannon s information theory described digital signals i e all or nothing signals alan turing s theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally the close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an electronic brain 91 50 93 examples of work in this vein includes robots such as w grey walter s turtles and the johns hopkins beast these machines did not use computers digital electronics or symbolic reasoning they were controlled entirely by analog circuitry 91 51 93 walter pitts and warren mcculloch analyzed networks of idealized artificial neurons and showed how they might perform simple logical functions in 1943 91 52 93 91 53 93 they were the first to describe what later researchers would call a neural network 91 54 93 one of the students inspired by pitts and mcculloch was a young marvin minsky then a 24 year old graduate student in 1951 with dean edmonds he built the first neural net machine the snarc 91 55 93 minsky was to become one of the most important leaders and innovators in ai for the next 50 years turing s test edit in 1950 alan turing published a landmark paper in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think 91 56 93 he noted that thinking is difficult to define and devised his famous turing test 91 57 93 if a machine could carry on a conversation over a teleprinter that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being then it was reasonable to say that the machine was thinking this simplified version of the problem allowed turing to argue convincingly that a thinking machine was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition 91 58 93 the turing test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence game ai edit in 1951 using the ferranti mark 1 machine of the university of manchester christopher strachey wrote a checkers program and dietrich prinz wrote one for chess 91 59 93 arthur samuel s checkers program developed in the middle 50s and early 60s eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur 91 60 93 game ai would continue to be used as a measure of progress in ai throughout its history symbolic reasoning and the logic theorist edit when access to digital computers became possible in the middle fifties a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought this was a new approach to creating thinking machines 91 61 93 in 1955 allen newell and future nobel laureate herbert a simon created the logic theorist with help from j c shaw the program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in russell and whitehead s principia mathematica and find new and more elegant proofs for some 91 62 93 simon said that they had solved the venerable mind body problem explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind 91 63 93 this was an early statement of the philosophical position john searle would later call strong ai that machines can contain minds just as human bodies do 91 64 93 dartmouth workshop 1956 the birth of ai edit the dartmouth workshop of 1956 91 65 93 was organized by marvin minsky john mccarthy and two senior scientists claude shannon and nathan rochester of ibm the proposal for the conference included this assertion every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it 91 66 93 the participants included ray solomonoff oliver selfridge trenchard more arthur samuel allen newell and herbert a simon all of whom would create important programs during the first decades of ai research 91 67 93 at the conference newell and simon debuted the logic theorist and mccarthy persuaded the attendees to accept artificial intelligence as the name of the field 91 68 93 the 1956 dartmouth conference was the moment that ai gained its name its mission its first success and its major players and is widely considered the birth of ai 91 69 93 the term artificial intelligence was chosen by mccarthy to avoid associations with cybernetics and connections with the influential cyberneticist norbert wiener 91 70 93 symbolic ai 1956 1974 edit main article symbolic artificial intelligence the programs developed in the years after the dartmouth workshop were to most people simply astonishing 91 71 93 computers were solving algebra word problems proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak english few at the time would have believed that such intelligent behavior by machines was possible at all 91 72 93 researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in less than 20 years 91 73 93 government agencies like darpa poured money into the new field 91 74 93 approaches edit there were many successful programs and new directions in the late 50s and 1960s among the most influential were these reasoning as search edit many early ai programs used the same basic algorithm to achieve some goal like winning a game or proving a theorem they proceeded step by step towards it by making a move or a deduction as if searching through a maze backtracking whenever they reached a dead end this paradigm was called reasoning as search 91 75 93 the principal difficulty was that for many problems the number of possible paths through the maze was simply astronomical a situation known as a combinatorial explosion researchers would reduce the search space by using heuristics or rules of thumb that would eliminate those paths that were unlikely to lead to a solution 91 76 93 newell and simon tried to capture a general version of this algorithm in a program called the general problem solver 91 77 93 other searching programs were able to accomplish impressive tasks like solving problems in geometry and algebra such as herbert gelernter s geometry theorem prover 1958 and saint written by minsky s student james slagle 1961 91 78 93 other programs searched through goals and subgoals to plan actions like the strips system developed at stanford to control the behavior of their robot shakey 91 79 93 an example of a semantic network natural language edit an important goal of ai research is to allow computers to communicate in natural languages like english an early success was daniel bobrow s program student which could solve high school algebra word problems 91 80 93 a semantic net represents concepts e g house door as nodes and relations among concepts e g has a as links between the nodes the first ai program to use a semantic net was written by ross quillian 91 81 93 and the most successful and controversial version was roger schank s conceptual dependency theory 91 82 93 joseph weizenbaum s eliza could carry out conversations that were so realistic that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a human being and not a program see eliza effect but in fact eliza had no idea what she was talking about she simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules eliza was the first chatterbot 91 83 93 micro worlds edit in the late 60s marvin minsky and seymour papert of the mit ai laboratory proposed that ai research should focus on artificially simple situations known as micro worlds they pointed out that in successful sciences like physics basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies much of the research focused on a blocks world which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface 91 84 93 this paradigm led to innovative work in machine vision by gerald sussman who led the team adolfo guzman david waltz who invented constraint propagation and especially patrick winston at the same time minsky and papert built a robot arm that could stack blocks bringing the blocks world to life the crowning achievement of the micro world program was terry winograd s shrdlu it could communicate in ordinary english sentences plan operations and execute them 91 85 93 automata edit in japan waseda university initiated the wabot project in 1967 and in 1972 completed the wabot 1 the world s first full scale intelligent humanoid robot 91 86 93 91 87 93 or android its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs and to grip and transport objects with hands using tactile sensors its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors artificial eyes and ears and its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in japanese with an artificial mouth 91 88 93 91 89 93 91 90 93 optimism edit the first generation of ai researchers made these predictions about their work 1958 h a simon and allen newell within ten years a digital computer will be the world s chess champion and within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem 91 91 93 1965 h a simon machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do 91 92 93 1967 marvin minsky within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved 91 93 93 1970 marvin minsky in life magazine in from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being 91 94 93 financing edit in june 1963 mit received a 2 2 million grant from the newly created advanced research projects agency later known as darpa the money was used to fund project mac which subsumed the ai group founded by minsky and mccarthy five years earlier darpa continued to provide three million dollars a year until the 70s 91 95 93 darpa made similar grants to newell and simon s program at cmu and to the stanford ai project founded by john mccarthy in 1963 91 96 93 another important ai laboratory was established at edinburgh university by donald michie in 1965 91 97 93 these four institutions would continue to be the main centers of ai research and funding in academia for many years 91 98 93 the money was proffered with few strings attached j c r licklider then the director of arpa believed that his organization should fund people not projects and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them 91 99 93 this created a freewheeling atmosphere at mit that gave birth to the hacker culture 91 100 93 but this hands off approach would not last the first ai winter 1974 1980 edit in the 1970s ai was subject to critiques and financial setbacks ai researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high and when the promised results failed to materialize funding for ai disappeared 91 101 93 at the same time the field of connectionism or neural nets was shut down almost completely for 10 years by marvin minsky s devastating criticism of perceptrons 91 102 93 despite the difficulties with public perception of ai in the late 70s new ideas were explored in logic programming commonsense reasoning and many other areas 91 103 93 the problems edit in the early seventies the capabilities of ai programs were limited even the most impressive could only handle trivial versions of the problems they were supposed to solve all the programs were in some sense toys 91 104 93 ai researchers had begun to run into several fundamental limits that could not be overcome in the 1970s although some of these limits would be conquered in later decades others still stymie the field to this day 91 105 93 limited computer power there was not enough memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful for example ross quillian s successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in memory 91 106 93 hans moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence he suggested an analogy artificial intelligence requires computer power in the same way that aircraft require horsepower below a certain threshold it s impossible but as power increases eventually it could become easy 91 107 93 with regard to computer vision moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general purpose computer capable of 109 operations second 1000 mips 91 108 93 as of 2011 practical computer vision applications require 10 000 to 1 000 000 mips by comparison the fastest supercomputer in 1976 cray 1 retailing at 5 million to 8 million was only capable of around 80 to 130 mips and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 mips intractability and the combinatorial explosion in 1972 richard karp building on stephen cook s 1971 theorem showed there are many problems that can probably only be solved in exponential time in the size of the inputs finding optimal solutions to these problems requires unimaginable amounts of computer time except when the problems are trivial this almost certainly meant that many of the toy solutions used by ai would probably never scale up into useful systems 91 109 93 commonsense knowledge and reasoning many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply enormous amounts of information about the world the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about this requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information no one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information 91 110 93 moravec s paradox proving theorems and solving geometry problems is comparatively easy for computers but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult this helps explain why research into vision and robotics had made so little progress by the middle 1970s 91 111 93 the frame and qualification problems ai researchers like john mccarthy who used logic discovered that they could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making changes to the structure of logic itself they developed new logics like non monotonic logics and modal logics to try to solve the problems 91 112 93 the end of funding edit see also ai winter the agencies which funded ai research such as the british government darpa and nrc became frustrated with the lack of progress and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into ai the pattern began as early as 1966 when the alpac report appeared criticizing machine translation efforts after spending 20 million dollars the nrc ended all support 91 113 93 in 1973 the lighthill report on the state of ai research in england criticized the utter failure of ai to achieve its grandiose objectives and led to the dismantling of ai research in that country 91 114 93 the report specifically mentioned the combinatorial explosion problem as a reason for ai s failings 91 115 93 darpa was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the speech understanding research program at cmu and canceled an annual grant of three million dollars 91 116 93 by 1974 funding for ai projects was hard to find hans moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration 91 117 93 however there was another issue since the passage of the mansfield amendment in 1969 darpa had been under increasing pressure to fund mission oriented direct research rather than basic undirected research funding for the creative freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from darpa instead the money was directed at specific projects with clear objectives such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems 91 118 93 critiques from across campus edit see also philosophy of artificial intelligence several philosophers had strong objections to the claims being made by ai researchers one of the earliest was john lucas who argued that g del s incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system such as a computer program could never see the truth of certain statements while a human being could 91 119 93 hubert dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 1960s and critiqued the assumptions of ai arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little symbol processing and a great deal of embodied instinctive unconscious know how 91 120 93 91 121 93 john searle s chinese room argument presented in 1980 attempted to show that a program could not be said to understand the symbols that it uses a quality called intentionality if the symbols have no meaning for the machine searle argued then the machine can not be described as thinking 91 122 93 these critiques were not taken seriously by ai researchers often because they seemed so far off the point problems like intractability and commonsense knowledge seemed much more immediate and serious it was unclear what difference know how or intentionality made to an actual computer program minsky said of dreyfus and searle they misunderstand and should be ignored 91 123 93 dreyfus who taught at mit was given a cold shoulder he later said that ai researchers dared not be seen having lunch with me 91 124 93 joseph weizenbaum the author of eliza felt his colleagues treatment of dreyfus was unprofessional and childish 91 125 93 although he was an outspoken critic of dreyfus positions he deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being 91 126 93 weizenbaum began to have serious ethical doubts about ai when kenneth colby wrote a computer program which can conduct psychotherapeutic dialogue based on eliza 91 127 93 weizenbaum was disturbed that colby saw a mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool a feud began and the situation was not helped when colby did not credit weizenbaum for his contribution to the program in 1976 weizenbaum published computer power and human reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence has the potential to devalue human life 91 128 93 perceptrons and the attack on connectionism edit a perceptron was a form of neural network introduced in 1958 by frank rosenblatt who had been a schoolmate of marvin minsky at the bronx high school of science like most ai researchers he was optimistic about their power predicting that perceptron may eventually be able to learn make decisions and translate languages an active research program into the paradigm was carried out throughout the 1960s but came to a sudden halt with the publication of minsky and papert s 1969 book perceptrons it suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that frank rosenblatt s predictions had been grossly exaggerated the effect of the book was devastating virtually no research at all was done in connectionism for 10 years eventually a new generation of researchers would revive the field and thereafter it would become a vital and useful part of artificial intelligence rosenblatt would not live to see this as he died in a boating accident shortly after the book was published 91 102 93 logic and symbolic reasoning the neats edit logic was introduced into ai research as early as 1959 by john mccarthy in his advice taker proposal 91 129 93 in 1963 j alan robinson had discovered a simple method to implement deduction on computers the resolution and unification algorithm however straightforward implementations like those attempted by mccarthy and his students in the late 1960s were especially intractable the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems 91 130 93 a more fruitful approach to logic was developed in the 1970s by robert kowalski at the university of edinburgh and soon this led to the collaboration with french researchers alain colmerauer and philippe roussel who created the successful logic programming language prolog 91 131 93 prolog uses a subset of logic horn clauses closely related to rules and production rules that permit tractable computation rules would continue to be influential providing a foundation for edward feigenbaum s expert systems and the continuing work by allen newell and herbert a simon that would lead to soar and their unified theories of cognition 91 132 93 critics of the logical approach noted as dreyfus had that human beings rarely used logic when they solved problems experiments by psychologists like peter wason eleanor rosch amos tversky daniel kahneman and others provided proof 91 133 93 mccarthy responded that what people do is irrelevant he argued that what is really needed are machines that can solve problems not machines that think as people do 91 134 93 frames and scripts the scuffles edit among the critics of mccarthy s approach were his colleagues across the country at mit marvin minsky seymour papert and roger schank were trying to solve problems like story understanding and object recognition that required a machine to think like a person in order to use ordinary concepts like chair or restaurant they had to make all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made unfortunately imprecise concepts like these are hard to represent in logic gerald sussman observed that using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn t make them any more precise 91 135 93 schank described their anti logic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms used by mccarthy kowalski feigenbaum newell and simon 91 136 93 in 1975 in a seminal paper minsky noted that many of his fellow scruffy researchers were using the same kind of tool a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something for example if we use the concept of a bird there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind we might assume that it flies eats worms and so on we know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be logical but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think he called these structures frames schank used a version of frames he called scripts to successfully answer questions about short stories in english 91 137 93 boom 1980 1987 edit in the 1980s a form of ai program called expert systems was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream ai research in those same years the japanese government aggressively funded ai with its fifth generation computer project another encouraging event in the early 1980s was the revival of connectionism in the work of john hopfield and david rumelhart once again ai had achieved success 91 138 93 the rise of expert systems edit an expert system is a program that answers questions or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts the earliest examples were developed by edward feigenbaum and his students dendral begun in 1965 identified compounds from spectrometer readings mycin developed in 1972 diagnosed infectious blood diseases they demonstrated the feasibility of the approach 91 139 93 expert systems restricted themselves to a small domain of specific knowledge thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place all in all the programs proved to be useful something that ai had not been able to achieve up to this point 91 140 93 in 1980 an expert system called xcon was completed at cmu for the digital equipment corporation it was an enormous success it was saving the company 40 million dollars annually by 1986 91 141 93 corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on ai most of it to in house ai departments 91 142 93 an industry grew up to support them including hardware companies like symbolics and lisp machines and software companies such as intellicorp and aion 91 143 93 the knowledge revolution edit the power of expert systems came from the expert knowledge they contained they were part of a new direction in ai research that had been gaining ground throughout the 70s ai researchers were beginning to suspect reluctantly for it violated the scientific canon of parsimony that intelligence might very well be based on the ability to use large amounts of diverse knowledge in different ways 91 144 93 writes pamela mccorduck t he great lesson from the 1970s was that intelligent behavior depended very much on dealing with knowledge sometimes quite detailed knowledge of a domain where a given task lay 91 145 93 knowledge based systems and knowledge engineering became a major focus of ai research in the 1980s 91 146 93 the 1980s also saw the birth of cyc the first attempt to attack the commonsense knowledge problem directly by creating a massive database that would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows douglas lenat who started and led the project argued that there is no shortcut the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them one concept at a time by hand the project was not expected to be completed for many decades 91 147 93 chess playing programs hitech and deep thought defeated chess masters in 1989 both were developed by carnegie mellon university deep thought development paved the way for deep blue 91 148 93 the money returns the fifth generation project edit in 1981 the japanese ministry of international trade and industry set aside 850 million for the fifth generation computer project their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations translate languages interpret pictures and reason like human beings 91 149 93 much to the chagrin of scruffies they chose prolog as the primary computer language for the project 91 150 93 other countries responded with new programs of their own the uk began the 350 million alvey project a consortium of american companies formed the microelectronics and computer technology corporation or mcc to fund large scale projects in ai and information technology 91 151 93 91 152 93 darpa responded as well founding the strategic computing initiative and tripling its investment in ai between 1984 and 1988 91 153 93 a hopfield net with four nodes the revival of connectionism edit in 1982 physicist john hopfield was able to prove that a form of neural network now called a hopfield net could learn and process information in a completely new way around the same time geoffrey hinton and david rumelhart popularized a method for training neural networks called backpropagation also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by seppo linnainmaa 1970 and applied to neural networks by paul werbos these two discoveries helped to revive the field of connectionism 91 152 93 91 154 93 the new field was unified and inspired by the appearance of parallel distributed processing in 1986 a two volume collection of papers edited by rumelhart and psychologist james mcclelland neural networks would become commercially successful in the 1990s when they began to be used as the engines driving programs like optical character recognition and speech recognition 91 152 93 91 155 93 the development of metal oxide semiconductor mos very large scale integration vlsi in the form of complementary mos cmos technology enabled the development of practical artificial neural network ann technology in the 1980s a landmark publication in the field was the 1989 book analog vlsi implementation of neural systems by carver a mead and mohammed ismail 91 156 93 bust the second ai winter 1987 1993 edit the business community s fascination with ai rose and fell in the 1980s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble the collapse was due to the failure of commercial vendors to develop a wide variety of workable solutions as dozens of companies failed the perception was that the technology was not viable 91 157 93 however the field continued to make advances despite the criticism numerous researchers including robotics developers rodney brooks and hans moravec argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence ai winter edit the term ai winter was coined by researchers who had survived the funding cuts of 1974 when they became concerned that enthusiasm for expert systems had spiraled out of control and that disappointment would certainly follow 91 158 93 their fears were well founded in the late 1980s and early 1990s ai suffered a series of financial setbacks the first indication of a change in weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized ai hardware in 1987 desktop computers from apple and ibm had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive lisp machines made by symbolics and others there was no longer a good reason to buy them an entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight 91 159 93 eventually the earliest successful expert systems such as xcon proved too expensive to maintain they were difficult to update they could not learn they were brittle i e they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs and they fell prey to problems such as the qualification problem that had been identified years earlier expert systems proved useful but only in a few special contexts 91 160 93 in the late 1980s the strategic computing initiative cut funding to ai deeply and brutally new leadership at darpa had decided that ai was not the next wave and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results 91 161 93 by 1991 the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for japan s fifth generation project had not been met indeed some of them like carry on a casual conversation had not been met by 2010 91 162 93 as with other ai projects expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible 91 162 93 91 163 93 over 300 ai companies had shut down gone bankrupt or been acquired by the end of 1993 effectively ending the first commercial wave of ai 91 164 93 in 1994 hp newquist stated in the brain makers that the immediate future of artificial intelligence in its commercial form seems to rest in part on the continued success of neural networks 91 164 93 nouvelle ai and embodied reason edit main articles nouvelle ai behavior based ai situated and embodied cognitive science in the late 1980s several researchers advocated a completely new approach to artificial intelligence based on robotics 91 165 93 they believed that to show real intelligence a machine needs to have a body it needs to perceive move survive and deal with the world they argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill see moravec s paradox they advocated building intelligence from the bottom up 91 166 93 the approach revived ideas from cybernetics and control theory that had been unpopular since the sixties another precursor was david marr who had come to mit in the late 1970s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision he rejected all symbolic approaches both mccarthy s logic and minsky s frames arguing that ai needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place marr s work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980 91 167 93 in his 1990 paper elephants don t play chess 91 168 93 robotics researcher rodney brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis arguing that symbols are not always necessary since the world is its own best model it is always exactly up to date it always has every detail there is to be known the trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough 91 169 93 in the 1980s and 1990s many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning a theory called the embodied mind thesis 91 170 93 ai 1993 2011 edit the field of ai now more than a half a century old finally achieved some of its oldest goals it began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry although somewhat behind the scenes some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability still the reputation of ai in the business world at least was less than pristine 91 171 93 inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for ai s failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s together all these factors helped to fragment ai into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of artificial intelligence 91 172 93 ai was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been milestones and moore s law edit on 11 may 1997 deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov 91 173 93 the super computer was a specialized version of a framework produced by ibm and was capable of processing twice as many moves per second as it had during the first match which deep blue had lost reportedly 200 000 000 moves per second the event was broadcast live over the internet and received over 74 million hits 91 174 93 in 2005 a stanford robot won the darpa grand challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail 91 175 93 two years later a team from cmu won the darpa urban challenge by autonomously navigating 55 miles in an urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws 91 176 93 in february 2011 in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm s question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin 91 177 93 these successes were not due to some revolutionary new paradigm but mostly on the tedious application of engineering skill and on the tremendous increase in the speed and capacity of computer by the 90s 91 178 93 in fact deep blue s computer was 10 million times faster than the ferranti mark 1 that christopher strachey taught to play chess in 1951 91 179 93 this dramatic increase is measured by moore s law which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years as a result of metal oxide semiconductor mos transistor counts doubling every two years the fundamental problem of raw computer power was slowly being overcome intelligent agents edit a new paradigm called intelligent agents became widely accepted during the 1990s 91 180 93 although earlier researchers had proposed modular divide and conquer approaches to ai 91 181 93 the intelligent agent did not reach its modern form until judea pearl allen newell leslie p kaelbling and others brought concepts from decision theory and economics into the study of ai 91 182 93 when the economist s definition of a rational agent was married to computer science s definition of an object or module the intelligent agent paradigm was complete an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success by this definition simple programs that solve specific problems are intelligent agents as are human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms the intelligent agent paradigm defines ai research as the study of intelligent agents this is a generalization of some earlier definitions of ai it goes beyond studying human intelligence it studies all kinds of intelligence 91 183 93 the paradigm gave researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful it provided a common language to describe problems and share their solutions with each other and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents like economics and control theory it was hoped that a complete agent architecture like newell s soar would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents 91 182 93 91 184 93 probabilistic reasoning and greater rigor edit ai researchers began to develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past 91 185 93 there was a widespread realization that many of the problems that ai needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like mathematics electrical engineering economics or operations research the shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable ai had become a more rigorous scientific discipline russell amp norvig 2003 describe this as nothing less than a revolution they had argued in their 2002 textbook that this increased rigor could be viewed plausibly as a victory of the neats 91 186 93 but subsequently qualified that by saying in their 2020 ai textbook that the present emphasis on deep learning may represent a resurgence of the scruffies 91 187 93 judea pearl s influential 1988 book 91 188 93 brought probability and decision theory into ai among the many new tools in use were bayesian networks hidden markov models information theory stochastic modeling and classical optimization precise mathematical descriptions were also developed for computational intelligence paradigms like neural networks and evolutionary algorithms 91 189 93 ai behind the scenes edit algorithms originally developed by ai researchers began to appear as parts of larger systems ai had solved a lot of very difficult problems 91 190 93 and their solutions proved to be useful throughout the technology industry 91 191 93 such as data mining industrial robotics logistics 91 192 93 speech recognition 91 193 93 banking software 91 194 93 medical diagnosis 91 194 93 and google s search engine 91 195 93 the field of ai received little or no credit for these successes in the 1990s and early 2000s many of ai s greatest innovations have been reduced to the status of just another item in the tool chest of computer science 91 196 93 nick bostrom explains a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it s not labeled ai anymore 91 197 93 many researchers in ai in the 1990s deliberately called their work by other names such as informatics knowledge based systems cognitive systems or computational intelligence in part this may have been because they considered their field to be fundamentally different from ai but also the new names help to procure funding in the commercial world at least the failed promises of the ai winter continued to haunt ai research into the 2000s as the new york times reported in 2005 computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild eyed dreamers 91 198 93 91 199 93 91 200 93 91 201 93 predictions or where is hal 9000 edit in 1968 arthur c clarke and stanley kubrick had imagined that by the year 2001 a machine would exist with an intelligence that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings the character they created hal 9000 was based on a belief shared by many leading ai researchers that such a machine would exist by the year 2001 91 202 93 91 203 93 in 2001 ai founder marvin minsky asked so the question is why didn t we get hal in 2001 91 204 93 minsky believed that the answer is that the central problems like commonsense reasoning were being neglected while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms john mccarthy on the other hand still blamed the qualification problem 91 205 93 for ray kurzweil the issue is computer power and using moore s law he predicted that machines with human level intelligence will appear by 2029 91 206 93 jeff hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems 91 207 93 there were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway deep learning big data and artificial general intelligence 2011 present edit in the first decades of the 21st century access to large amounts of data known as big data cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy in fact mckinsey global institute estimated in their famous paper big data the next frontier for innovation competition and productivity that by 2009 nearly all sectors in the us economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data by 2016 the market for ai related products hardware and software reached more than 8 billion dollars and the new york times reported that interest in ai had reached a frenzy 91 208 93 the applications of big data began to reach into other fields as well such as training models in ecology 91 209 93 and for various applications in economics 91 210 93 advances in deep learning particularly deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks drove progress and research in image and video processing text analysis and even speech recognition 91 211 93 deep learning edit main article deep learning deep learning is a branch of machine learning that models high level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with many processing layers 91 211 93 according to the universal approximation theorem deep ness isn t necessary for a neural network to be able to approximate arbitrary continuous functions even so there are many problems that are common to shallow networks such as overfitting that deep networks help avoid 91 212 93 as such deep neural networks are able to realistically generate much more complex models as compared to their shallow counterparts however deep learning has problems of its own a common problem for recurrent neural networks is the vanishing gradient problem which is where gradients passed between layers gradually shrink and literally disappear as they are rounded off to zero there have been many methods developed to approach this problem such as long short term memory units state of the art deep neural network architectures can sometimes even rival human accuracy in fields like computer vision specifically on things like the mnist database and traffic sign recognition 91 213 93 language processing engines powered by smart search engines can easily beat humans at answering general trivia questions such as ibm watson and recent developments in deep learning have produced astounding results in competing with humans in things like go and doom which being a first person shooter game has sparked some controversy 91 214 93 91 215 93 91 216 93 91 217 93 big data edit main article big data big data refers to a collection of data that cannot be captured managed and processed by conventional software tools within a certain time frame it is a massive amount of decision making insight and process optimization capabilities that require new processing models in the big data era written by victor meyer schonberg and kenneth cooke big data means that instead of random analysis sample survey all data is used for analysis the 5v characteristics of big data proposed by ibm volume velocity variety 91 218 93 value 91 219 93 veracity 91 220 93 the strategic significance of big data technology is not to master huge data information but to specialize in these meaningful data in other words if big data is likened to an industry the key to realizing profitability in this industry is to increase the process capability of the data and realize the value added of the data through processing artificial general intelligence edit main article artificial general intelligence general intelligence is the ability to solve any problem rather than finding a solution to a particular problem artificial general intelligence or agi is a program which can apply intelligence to a wide variety of problems in much the same ways humans can ben goertzel and others argued in the early 2000s that ai research had largely given up on the field s original goal of creating artificial general intelligence agi research was founded as a separate sub field and by 2010 there were academic conferences laboratories and university courses dedicated to agi research as well as private consortiums and new companies artificial general intelligence is also referred to as strong ai 91 221 93 full ai 91 222 93 or synthetic intelligence 91 223 93 91 224 93 as opposed to weak ai or narrow ai academic sources reserve strong ai to refer to machines capable of experiencing consciousness foundation models which are large artificial intelligence models trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks began to be developed in 2018 models such as gpt 3 released by openai in 2020 and gato released by deepmind in 2022 have been described as important milestones on the path to
