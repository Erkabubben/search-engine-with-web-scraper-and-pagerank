91 1 93 is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces such a system is typically employed to authenticate users through id verification services and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image 91 2 93 development began on similar systems in the 1960s beginning as a form of computer application since their inception facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology such as robotics because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human s physiological characteristics facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition it is widely adopted due to its contactless process 91 3 93 facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human computer interaction video surveillance and automatic indexing of images 91 4 93 facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies 91 5 93 their effectiveness varies and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness the use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy with claims that the systems violate citizens privacy commonly make incorrect identifications encourage gender norms and racial profiling and do not protect important biometric data the appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security 91 6 93 these claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the united states 91 7 93 as a result of growing societal concerns meta announced 91 8 93 that it plans to shut down facebook facial recognition system deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users 91 9 93 this change will represent one of the largest shifts

helen chan wolf and charles bisson worked on using the computer to recognize human faces their early facial recognition project was dubbed man machine because the coordinates of the facial features in a photograph had to be established by a human before they could be used by the computer for recognition on a graphics tablet a human had to pinpoint the coordinates of facial features such as the pupil centers the inside and outside corner of eyes and the widows peak in the hairline the coordinates were used to calculate 20 distances including the width of the mouth and of the eyes a human could process about 40 pictures an hour in this manner and so build a database of the computed distances a computer would then automatically compare the distances for each photograph calculate the difference between the distances and return the closed records as a possible match 91 10 93 in 1970 takeo kanade publicly demonstrated a face matching system that located anatomical features such as the chin and calculated the distance ratio between facial features without human intervention later tests revealed that the system could not always reliably identify facial features nonetheless interest in the subject grew and in 1977 kanade published the first detailed book on facial recognition technology 91 11 93 in 1993 the defense advanced research project agency darpa and the army research laboratory arl established the face recognition technology program feret to develop automatic face recognition capabilities that could be employed in a productive real life environment to assist security intelligence and law enforcement personnel in the performance of their duties face recognition systems that had been trialed in research labs were evaluated and the feret tests found that while the performance of existing automated facial recognition systems varied a handful of existing methods could viably be used to recognize faces in still images taken in a controlled environment 91 12 93 the feret tests spawned three us companies that sold automated facial recognition systems vision corporation and miros inc were both founded in 1994 by researchers who used the results of the feret tests as a selling point viisage technology was established by a identification card defense contractor in 1996 to commercially exploit the rights to the facial recognition algorithm developed by alex pentland at mit 91 13 93 following the 1993 feret face recognition vendor test the department of motor vehicles dmv offices in west virginia and new mexico were the first dmv offices to use automated facial recognition systems as a way to prevent and detect people obtaining multiple driving licenses under different names driver s licenses in the united states were at that point a commonly accepted form of photo identification dmv offices across the united states were undergoing a technological upgrade and were in the process of establishing databases of digital id photographs this enabled dmv offices to deploy the facial recognition systems on the market to search photographs for new driving licenses against the existing dmv database 91 14 93 dmv offices became one of the first major markets for automated facial recognition technology and introduced us citizens to facial recognition as a standard method of identification 91 15 93 the increase of the us prison population in the 1990s prompted u s states to established connected and automated identification systems that incorporated digital biometric databases in some instances this included facial recognition in 1999 minnesota incorporated the facial recognition system faceit by visionics into a mug shot booking system that allowed police judges and court officers to track criminals across the state 91 16 93 in this shear mapping the red arrow changes direction but the blue arrow does not and is used as eigenvector the viola jones algorithm for face detection uses haar like features to locate faces in an image here a haar feature that looks similar to the bridge of the nose is applied onto the face until the 1990s facial recognition systems were developed primarily by using photographic portraits of human faces research on face recognition to reliably locate a face in an image that contains other objects gained traction in the early 1990s with the principle component analysis pca the pca method of face detection is also known as eigenface and was developed by matthew turk and alex pentland 91 17 93 turk and pentland combined the conceptual approach of the karhunen lo ve theorem and factor analysis to develop a linear model eigenfaces are determined based on global and orthogonal features in human faces a human face is calculated as a weighted combination of a number of eigenfaces because few eigenfaces were used to encode human faces of a given population turk and pentland s pca face detection method greatly reduced the amount of data that had to be processed to detect a face pentland in 1994 defined eigenface features including eigen eyes eigen mouths and eigen noses to advance the use of pca in facial recognition in 1997 the pca eigenface method of face recognition 91 18 93 was improved upon using linear discriminant analysis lda to produce fisherfaces 91 19 93 lda fisherfaces became dominantly used in pca feature based face recognition while eigenfaces were also used for face reconstruction in these approaches no global structure of the face is calculated which links the facial features or parts 91 20 93 purely feature based approaches to facial recognition were overtaken in the late 1990s by the bochum system which used gabor filter to record the face features and computed a grid of the face structure to link the features 91 21 93 christoph von der malsburg and his research team at the university of bochum developed elastic bunch graph matching in the mid 1990s to extract a face out of an image using skin segmentation 91 22 93 by 1997 the face detection method developed by malsburg outperformed most other facial detection systems on the market the so called bochum system of face detection was sold commercially on the market as zn face to operators of airports and other busy locations the software was robust enough to make identifications from less than perfect face views it can also often see through such impediments to identification as mustaches beards changed hairstyles and glasses even sunglasses 91 23 93 real time face detection in video footage became possible in 2001 with the viola jones object detection framework for faces 91 24 93 paul viola and michael jones combined their face detection method with the haar like feature approach to object recognition in digital images to launch adaboost the first real time frontal view face detector 91 25 93 by 2015 the viola jones algorithm had been implemented using small low power detectors on handheld devices and embedded systems therefore the viola jones algorithm has not only broadened the practical application of face recognition systems but has also been used to support new features in user interfaces and teleconferencing 91 26 93 ukraine is using the us based clearview ai facial recognition software to identify dead russian soldiers ukraine has conducted 8 600 searches and identified the families of 582 deceased russian soldiers the it volunteer section of the ukrainian army using the software is subsequently contacting the families of the deceased soldiers to raise awareness of russian activities in ukraine the main goal is to destabilise the russian government it can be seen as a form of psychological warfare about 340 ukrainian government officials in five government ministries are using the technology it is used to catch spies that might try to enter ukraine 91 27 93 clearview ai s facial recognition database is only available to government agencies who may only use the technology to assist in the course of law enforcement investigations or in connection with national security 91 28 93 the software was donated to ukraine by clearview ai russia is thought to be using it to find anti war activists clearview ai was originally designed for us law enforcement using it in war raises new ethical concerns one london based surveillance expert stephen hare is concerned it might make the ukrainians appear inhuman is it actually working or is it making russians say look at these lawless cruel ukrainians doing this to our boys 91 29 93 techniques for face recognition edit automatic face detection with opencv while humans can recognize faces without much effort 91 30 93 facial recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem in computing facial recognition systems attempt to identify a human face which is three dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression based on its two dimensional image to accomplish this computational task facial recognition systems perform four steps first face detection is used to segment the face from the image background in the second step the segmented face image is aligned to account for face pose image size and photographic properties such as illumination and grayscale the purpose of the alignment process is to enable the accurate localization of facial features in the third step the facial feature extraction features such as eyes nose and mouth are pinpointed and measured in the image to represent the face the so established feature vector of the face is then in the fourth step matched against a database of faces 91 31 93 traditional edit some eigenfaces from at amp t laboratories cambridge some face recognition algorithms identify facial features by extracting landmarks or features from an image of the subject s face for example an algorithm may analyze the relative position size and or shape of the eyes nose cheekbones and jaw 91 32 93 these features are then used to search for other images with matching features 91 33 93 other algorithms normalize a gallery of face images and then compress the face data only saving the data in the image that is useful for face recognition a probe image is then compared with the face data 91 34 93 one of the earliest successful systems 91 35 93 is based on template matching techniques 91 36 93 applied to a set of salient facial features providing a sort of compressed face representation recognition algorithms can be divided into two main approaches geometric which looks at distinguishing features or photo metric which is a statistical approach that distills an image into values and compares the values with templates to eliminate variances some classify these algorithms into two broad categories holistic and feature based models the former attempts to recognize the face in its entirety while the feature based subdivide into components such as according to features and analyze each as well as its spatial location with respect to other features 91 37 93 popular recognition algorithms include principal component analysis using eigenfaces linear discriminant analysis elastic bunch graph matching using the fisherface algorithm the hidden markov model the multilinear subspace learning using tensor representation and the neuronal motivated dynamic link matching 91 citation needed 93 91 38 93 modern facial recognition systems make increasing use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning 91 39 93 human identification at a distance hid edit to enable human identification at a distance hid low resolution images of faces are enhanced using face hallucination in cctv imagery faces are often very small but because facial recognition algorithms that identify and plot facial features require high resolution images resolution enhancement techniques have been developed to enable facial recognition systems to work with imagery that has been captured in environments with a high signal to noise ratio face hallucination algorithms that are applied to images prior to those images being submitted to the facial recognition system use example based machine learning with pixel substitution or nearest neighbour distribution indexes that may also incorporate demographic and age related facial characteristics use of face hallucination techniques improves the performance of high resolution facial recognition algorithms and may be used to overcome the inherent limitations of super resolution algorithms face hallucination techniques are also used to pre treat imagery where faces are disguised here the disguise such as sunglasses is removed and the face hallucination algorithm is applied to the image such face hallucination algorithms need to be trained on similar face images with and without disguise to fill in the area uncovered by removing the disguise face hallucination algorithms need to correctly map the entire state of the face which may be not possible due to the momentary facial expression captured in the low resolution image 91 40 93 3 dimensional recognition edit 3d model of a human face three dimensional face recognition technique uses 3d sensors to capture information about the shape of a face this information is then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of a face such as the contour of the eye sockets nose and chin 91 41 93 one advantage of 3d face recognition is that it is not affected by changes in lighting like other techniques it can also identify a face from a range of viewing angles including a profile view 91 41 93 91 33 93 three dimensional data points from a face vastly improve the precision of face recognition 3d dimensional face recognition research is enabled by the development of sophisticated sensors that project structured light onto the face 91 42 93 3d matching technique are sensitive to expressions therefore researchers at technion applied tools from metric geometry to treat expressions as isometries 91 43 93 a new method of capturing 3d images of faces uses three tracking cameras that point at different angles one camera will be pointing at the front of the subject second one to the side and third one at an angle all these cameras will work together so it can track a subject s face in real time and be able to face detect and recognize 91 44 93 thermal cameras edit a pseudocolor image of two people taken in long wavelength infrared body temperature thermal light a different form of taking input data for face recognition is by using thermal cameras by this procedure the cameras will only detect the shape of the head and it will ignore the subject accessories such as glasses hats or makeup 91 45 93 unlike conventional cameras thermal cameras can capture facial imagery even in low light and nighttime conditions without using a flash and exposing the position of the camera 91 46 93 however the databases for face recognition are limited efforts to build databases of thermal face images date back to 2004 91 45 93 by 2016 several databases existed including the iiitd pse and the notre dame thermal face database 91 47 93 current thermal face recognition systems are not able to reliably detect a face in a thermal image that has been taken of an outdoor environment 91 48 93 in 2018 researchers from the u s army research laboratory arl developed a technique that would allow them to match facial imagery obtained using a thermal camera with those in databases that were captured using a conventional camera 91 49 93 known as a cross spectrum synthesis method due to how it bridges facial recognition from two different imaging modalities this method synthesize a single image by analyzing multiple facial regions and details 91 50 93 it consists of a non linear regression model that maps a specific thermal image into a corresponding visible facial image and an optimization issue that projects the latent projection back into the image space 91 46 93 arl scientists have noted that the approach works by combining global information i e features across the entire face with local information i e features regarding the eyes nose and mouth 91 51 93 according to performance tests conducted at arl the multi region cross spectrum synthesis model demonstrated a performance improvement of about 30 over baseline methods and about 5 over state of the art methods 91 50 93 application edit social media edit founded in 2013 looksery went on to raise money for its face modification app on kickstarter after successful crowdfunding looksery launched in october 2014 the application allows video chat with others through a special filter for faces that modifies the look of users image augmenting applications already on the market such as facetune and perfect365 were limited to static images whereas looksery allowed augmented reality to live videos in late 2015 snapchat purchased looksery which would then become its landmark lenses function 91 52 93 snapchat filter applications use face detection technology and on the basis of the facial features identified in an image a 3d mesh mask is layered over the face 91 53 93 deepface is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at facebook it identifies human faces in digital images it employs a nine layer neural net with over 120 million connection weights and was trained on four million images uploaded by facebook users 91 54 93 91 55 93 the system is said to be 97 accurate compared to 85 for the fbi s next generation identification system 91 56 93 tiktok s algorithm has been regarded as especially effective but many were left to wonder at the exact programming that caused the app to be so effective in guessing the user s desired content 91 57 93 in june 2020 tiktok released a statement regarding the for you page and how they recommended videos to users which did not include facial recognition 91 58 93 in february 2021 however tiktok agreed to a 92 160 million settlement to a us lawsuit which alleged that the app had used facial recognition in both user videos and its algorithm to identify age gender and ethnicity 91 59 93 id verification edit the emerging use of facial recognition is in the use of id verification services many companies and others are working in the market now to provide these services to banks icos and other e businesses 91 60 93 face recognition has been leveraged as a form of biometric authentication for various computing platforms and devices 91 33 93 android 4 0 ice cream sandwich added facial recognition using a smartphone s front camera as a means of unlocking devices 91 61 93 91 62 93 while microsoft introduced face recognition login to its xbox 360 video game console through its kinect accessory 91 63 93 as well as windows 10 via its windows hello platform which requires an infrared illuminated camera 91 64 93 in 2017 apple s iphone x smartphone introduced facial recognition to the product line with its face id platform which uses an infrared illumination system 91 65 93 face id edit apple introduced face id on the flagship iphone x as a biometric authentication successor to the touch id a fingerprint based system face id has a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts a romeo module that projects more than 30 000 infrared dots onto the user s face and a juliet module that reads the pattern 91 66 93 the pattern is sent to a local secure enclave in the device s central processing unit cpu to confirm a match with the phone owner s face 91 67 93 the facial pattern is not accessible by apple the system will not work with eyes closed in an effort to prevent unauthorized access 91 67 93 the technology learns from changes in a user s appearance and therefore works with hats scarves glasses and many sunglasses beard and makeup 91 68 93 it also works in the dark this is done by using a flood illuminator which is a dedicated infrared flash that throws out invisible infrared light onto the user s face to properly read the 30 000 facial points 91 69 93 healthcare edit facial recognition algorithms can help in diagnosing some diseases using specific features on the nose cheeks and other part of the human face 91 70 93 relying on developed data sets machine learning has been used to identify genetic abnormalities just based on facial dimensions 91 71 93 frt has also been used to verify patients before surgery procedures in march 2022 according to a publication by forbes fdna an ai development company claimed that in the space of 10 years 91 72 93 they have worked with geneticists to develop a database of about 5 000 diseases and 1500 of them can be detected with facial recognition algorithms 91 73 93 deployment of frt for availing government services edit india edit in an interview the national health authority chief dr r s sharma said that facial recognition technology would be used in conjunction with aadhaar to authenticate the identity of people seeking vaccines 91 74 93 ten human rights and digital rights organizations and more than 150 individuals signed a statement by the internet freedom foundation that raised alarm against the deployment of facial recognition technology in the central government s vaccination drive process 91 75 93 implementation of an error prone system without adequate legislation containing mandatory safeguards would deprive citizens of essential services and linking this untested technology to the vaccination roll out in india will only exclude persons from the vaccine delivery system 91 76 93 in july 2021 a press release by the government of meghalaya stated that facial recognition technology frt would be used to verify the identity of pensioners to issue a digital life certificate using pensioner s life certification verification mobile application 91 77 93 the notice according to the press release purports to offer pensioners a secure easy and hassle free interface for verifying their liveness to the pension disbursing authorities from the comfort of their homes using smart phones mr jade jeremiah lyngdoh a law student sent a legal notice to the relevant authorities highlighting that the application has been rolled out without any anchoring legislation which governs the processing of personal data and thus lacks lawfulness and the government is not empowered to process data 91 78 93 deployment in security services edit swiss european surveillance face recognition and vehicle make model color and license plate reader commonwealth edit the australian border force and new zealand customs service have set up an automated border processing system called smartgate that uses face recognition which compares the face of the traveller with the data in the e passport microchip 91 79 93 91 80 93 all canadian international airports use facial recognition as part of the primary inspection kiosk program that compares a traveler face to their photo stored on the epassport this program first came to vancouver international airport in early 2017 and was rolled up to all remaining international airports in 2018 2019 91 81 93 police forces in the united kingdom have been trialing live facial recognition technology at public events since 2015 91 82 93 in may 2017 a man was arrested using an automatic facial recognition afr system mounted on a van operated by the south wales police ars technica reported that this appears to be the first time afr has led to an arrest 91 83 93 however a 2018 report by big brother watch found that these systems were up to 98 inaccurate 91 82 93 the report also revealed that two uk police forces south wales police and the metropolitan police were using live facial recognition at public events and in public spaces 91 84 93 in september 2019 south wales police use of facial recognition was ruled lawful 91 84 93 live facial recognition has been trialled since 2016 in the streets of london and will be used on a regular basis from metropolitan police from beginning of 2020 91 85 93 in august 2020 the court of appeal ruled that the way the facial recognition system had been used by the south wales police in 2017 and 2018 violated human rights 91 86 93 united states edit flight boarding gate with biometric face scanners developed by u s customs and border protection at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport the u s department of state operates one of the largest face recognition systems in the world with a database of 117 million american adults with photos typically drawn from driver s license photos 91 87 93 although it is still far from completion it is being put to use in certain cities to give clues as to who was in the photo the fbi uses the photos as an investigative tool not for positive identification 91 88 93 as of 2016 facial recognition was being used to identify people in photos taken by police in san diego and los angeles not on real time video and only against booking photos 91 89 93 and use was planned in west virginia and dallas 91 90 93 in recent years maryland has used face recognition by comparing people s faces to their driver s license photos the system drew controversy when it was used in baltimore to arrest unruly protesters after the death of freddie gray in police custody 91 91 93 many other states are using or developing a similar system however some states have laws prohibiting its use the fbi has also instituted its next generation identification program to include face recognition as well as more traditional biometrics like fingerprints and iris scans which can pull from both criminal and civil databases 91 92 93 the federal general accountability office criticized the fbi for not addressing various concerns related to privacy and accuracy 91 93 93 starting in 2018 u s customs and border protection deployed biometric face scanners at u s airports passengers taking outbound international flights can complete the check in security and the boarding process after getting facial images captured and verified by matching their id photos stored on cbp s database images captured for travelers with u s citizenship will be deleted within up to 12 hours transportation security administration tsa had expressed its intention to adopt a similar program for domestic air travel during the security check process in the future the american civil liberties union is one of the organizations against the program concerning that the program will be used for surveillance purposes 91 94 93 in 2019 researchers reported that immigration and customs enforcement uses facial recognition software against state driver s license databases including for some states that provide licenses to undocumented immigrants 91 93 93 in december 2022 16 major domestic airports in the us started testing facial recognition tech where kiosks with cameras are checking the photos on travelers ids to make sure that passengers are not impostors 91 95 93 china edit in 2006 the skynet project was initiated by the chinese government to implement cctv surveillance nationwide and as of 2018 there has been 20 million cameras many of which capable of real time facial recognition deployed across the country for this project 91 96 93 some official claim that the current skynet system can scan the entire chinese population in one second and the world population in two seconds 91 97 93 boarding gates with facial recognition technology at beijing west railway station in 2017 the qingdao police was able to identify twenty five wanted suspects using facial recognition equipment at the qingdao international beer festival one of which had been on the run for 10 years 91 98 93 the equipment works by recording a 15 second video clip and taking multiple snapshots of the subject that data is compared and analyzed with images from the police department s database and within 20 minutes the subject can be identified with a 98 1 accuracy 91 99 93 in 2018 chinese police in zhengzhou and beijing were using smart glasses to take photos which are compared against a government database using facial recognition to identify suspects retrieve an address and track people moving beyond their home areas 91 100 93 91 101 93 as of late 2017 china has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology in xinjiang reporters visiting the region found surveillance cameras installed every hundred meters or so in several cities as well as facial recognition checkpoints at areas like gas stations shopping centers

ijop and that the face code in the app was inoperable 91 105 93 in february 2020 following the coronavirus outbreak megvii applied for a bank loan to optimize the body temperature screening system it had launched to help identify people with symptoms of a coronavirus infection in crowds in the loan application megvii stated that it needed to improve the accuracy of identifying masked individuals 91 106 93 many public places in china are implemented with facial recognition equipment including railway stations airports tourist attractions expos and office buildings in october 2019 a professor at zhejiang sci tech university sued the hangzhou safari park for abusing private biometric information of customers the safari park uses facial recognition technology to verify the identities of its year card holders an estimated 300 tourist sites in china have installed facial recognition systems and use them to admit visitors this case is reported to be the first on the use of facial recognition systems in china 91 107 93 in august 2020 radio free asia reported that in 2019 geng guanjun a citizen of taiyuan city who had used the wechat app by tencent to forward a video to a friend in the united states was subsequently convicted on the charge of the crime picking quarrels and provoking troubles the court documents showed that the chinese police used a facial recognition system to identify geng guanjun as an overseas democracy activist and that china s network management and propaganda departments directly monitor wechat users 91 108 93 in 2019 protestors in hong kong destroyed smart lampposts amid concerns they could contain cameras and facial recognition system used for surveillance by chinese authorities 91 109 93 india edit even though facial recognition technology frt is not fully accurate 91 110 93 it is being increasingly deployed for identification purposes by the police in india frt systems generate a probability match score or a confidence score between the suspect who is to be identified and the database of identified criminals that is available with the police the national automated facial recognition system afrs 91 111 93 is already being developed by the national crime records bureau ncrb a body constituted under the ministry of home affairs the project seeks to develop and deploy a national database of photographs which would comport with a facial recognition technology system by the central and state security agencies the internet freedom foundation has flagged concerns regarding the project 91 112 93 the ngo has highlighted that the accuracy of frt systems are routinely exaggerated and the real numbers leave much to be desired 91 112 93 the implementation of such faulty frt systems would lead to high rates of false positives and false negatives in this recognition process 160 under the supreme court of india s decision in justice k s puttaswamy vs union of india 22017 10 scc 1 any justifiable intrusion by the state into people s right to privacy which is protected as a fundamental right under article 21 of the constitution must confirm to certain thresholds namely legality necessity proportionality and procedural safeguards 91 113 93 as per the internet freedom foundation the national automated facial recognition system afrs proposal fails to meet any of these thresholds citing absence of legality manifest arbitrariness and absence of safeguards and accountability 91 114 93 while the national level afrs project is still in the works police departments in various states in india are already deploying

positive happens when facial recognition technology misidentifies a person to be someone they are not that is it yields an incorrect positive result they often results in discrimination and strengthening of existing biases for example in 2018 delhi police reported that its frt system had an accuracy rate of 2 which sank to 1 in 2019 the frt system even failed to distinguish accurately between different sexes 91 125 93 the government of delhi in collaboration with indian space research organisation isro is developing a new technology called crime mapping analytics and predictive system cmaps the project aims to deploy space technology for controlling crime and maintaining law and order 91 123 93 the system will be connected to a database containing data of criminals 91 123 93 the technology is envisaged to be deployed to collect real time data at the crime scene 91 123 93 in a reply dated november 25 2020 to a right to information request filed by the internet freedom foundation seeking information about the facial recognition system being used by the delhi police with reference number depol r e 20 07128 91 126 93 the office of the deputy commissioner of police cum public information officer crime stated that they cannot provide the information under section 8 d of the right to information act 2005 91 127 93 a right to information rti request dated july 30 2020 was filed with the office of the commissioner kolkata police seeking information about the facial recognition technology that the department was using 91 128 93 the information sought was denied 91 129 93 stating that the department was exempted from disclosure under section 24 4 of the rti act latin america edit in the 2000 mexican presidential election the mexican government employed face recognition software to prevent voter fraud some individuals had been registering to vote under several different names in an attempt to place multiple votes by comparing new face images to those already in the voter database authorities were able to reduce duplicate registrations 91 130 93 in colombia public transport busses are fitted with a facial recognition system by facefirst inc to identify passengers that are sought by the national police of colombia facefirst inc also built the facial recognition system for tocumen international airport in panama the face recognition system is deployed to identify individuals among the travelers that are sought by the panamanian national police or interpol 91 131 93 tocumen international airport operates an airport wide surveillance system using hundreds of live face recognition cameras to identify wanted individuals passing through the airport the face recognition system was initially installed as part of a us 11 160 million contract and included a computer cluster of sixty computers a fiber optic cable network for the airport buildings as well as the installation of 150 surveillance cameras in the airport terminal and at about 30 airport gates 91 132 93 at the 2014 fifa world cup in brazil the federal police of brazil used face recognition goggles face recognition systems made in china were also deployed at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro 91 131 93 nuctech company provided 145 insepction terminals for maracan stadium and 55 terminals for the deodoro olympic park 91 133 93 european union edit police forces in

citizens this accounts for about 8 of the population in the netherlands face recognition is not used by the police on municipal cctv 91 138 93 south africa edit in south africa in 2016 the city of johannesburg announced it was rolling out smart cctv cameras complete with automatic number plate recognition and facial recognition 91 139 93 deployment in retail stores edit the us firm 3vr now identiv is an example of a vendor which began offering facial recognition systems and services to retailers as early as 2007 91 140 93 in 2012 the company advertised benefits such as dwell and queue line analytics to decrease customer wait times facial surveillance analytic s to facilitate personalized customer greetings by employees and the ability to c reate loyalty programs by combining point of sale pos data with facial recognition 91 141 93 united states edit in 2018 the national retail federation loss prevention research council called facial recognition technology a promising new tool worth evaluating 91 142 93 in july 2020 the reuters news agency reported that during the 2010s the pharmacy chain rite aid had deployed facial recognition video surveillance systems and components from facefirst deepcam llc and other vendors at some retail locations in the united states 91 142 93 cathy langley rite aid s vice president of asset protection used the phrase feature matching to refer to the systems and said that usage of the systems resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company s stores while former vice president of asset protection bob oberosler emphasized improved safety for staff and a reduced need for the involvement of law enforcement organizations 91 142 93 in a 2020 statement to reuters in response to the reporting rite aid said that it had ceased using the facial recognition software and switched off the cameras 91 142 93 according to director read hayes of the national retail federation loss prevention research council rite aid s surveillance program was either the largest or one of the largest programs in retail 91 142 93 the home depot menards walmart and 7 eleven are among other us retailers also engaged in large scale pilot programs or deployments of facial recognition technology 91 142 93 of the rite aid stores examined by reuters in 2020 those in communities where people of color made up the largest racial or ethnic group were three times as likely to have the technology installed 91 142 93 raising concerns related to the substantial history of racial segregation and racial profiling in the united states rite aid said that the selection of locations was data driven based on the theft histories of individual stores local and national crime data and site infrastructure 91 142 93 australia edit in 2019 facial recognition to prevent theft was in use at sydney s star casino and was also deployed at gaming venues in new zealand 91 143 93 in june 2022 consumer group choice reported facial recognition was in use in australia at kmart bunnings and the good guys the good guys subsequently suspended the technology pending a legal challenge by choice to the office of the australian information commissioner while bunnings kept the technology in use and kmart maintained its trial of the technology 91 144 93 additional uses edit disney s magic kingdom near orlando florida during a trial of a facial recognition technology for park entry at the american football championship game super bowl xxxv in january 2001 police in tampa bay florida used viisage face recognition software to search for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event 19 people with minor criminal records were potentially identified 91 145 93 91 146 93 face recognition systems have also been used by photo management software to identify the subjects of photographs enabling features such as searching images by person as well as suggesting photos to be shared with a specific contact if their presence were detected in a photo 91 147 93 91 148 93 by 2008 facial recognition systems were typically used as access control in security systems 91 149 93 the united states popular music and country music celebrity taylor swift surreptitiously employed facial recognition technology at a concert in 2018 the camera was embedded in a kiosk near a ticket booth and scanned concert goers as they entered the facility for known stalkers 91 150 93 on august 18 2019 the times reported that the uae owned manchester city hired a texas based firm blink identity to deploy facial recognition systems in a driver program the club has planned a single super fast lane for the supporters at the etihad stadium 91 151 93 however civil rights groups cautioned the club against the introduction of this technology saying that it would risk normalising a mass surveillance tool the policy and campaigns officer at liberty hannah couchman said that man city s move is alarming since the fans will be obliged to share deeply sensitive personal information with a private company where they could be tracked and monitored in their everyday lives 91 152 93 in 2019 casinos in australia and new zealand rolled out facial recognition to prevent theft and a representative of sydney s star casino said they would also provide customer service like welcoming a patron back to a bar 91 143 93 in august 2020 amid the covid 19 pandemic in the united states american football stadiums of new york and los angeles announced the installation of facial recognition for upcoming matches the purpose is to make the entry process as touchless as possible 91 153 93 disney s magic kingdom near orlando florida likewise announced a test of facial recognition technology to create a touchless experience during the pandemic the test was originally slated to take place between march 23 and april 23 2021 but the limited timeframe had been removed as of late april 91 154 93 media companies have begun using face recognition technology to streamline their tracking organizing and archiving pictures and videos 91 155 93 advantages and disadvantages edit compared to other biometric systems edit in 2006 the performance of the latest face recognition algorithms was evaluated in the face recognition grand challenge frgc high resolution face images 3 d face scans and iris images were used in the tests the results indicated that the new algorithms are 10 times more accurate than the face recognition algorithms of 2002 and 100 times more accurate than those of 1995 some of the algorithms were able to outperform human participants in recognizing faces and could uniquely identify identical twins 91 41 93 91 156 93 one key advantage of a facial recognition system that it is able to perform mass identification as it does not require the cooperation of the test subject to work properly designed systems installed in airports multiplexes and other public places can identify individuals among the crowd without passers by even being aware of the system 91 157 93 however as compared to other biometric techniques face recognition may not be most reliable and efficient quality measures are very important in facial recognition systems as large degrees of variations are possible in face images factors such as illumination expression pose and noise during face capture can affect the performance of facial recognition systems 91 157 93 among all biometric systems facial recognition has the highest false acceptance and rejection rates 91 157 93 thus questions have been raised on the effectiveness of face recognition software in cases of railway and airport security 91 158 93 weaknesses edit ralph gross a researcher at the carnegie mellon robotics institute in 2008 describes one obstacle related to the viewing angle of the face face recognition has been getting pretty good at full frontal faces and 20 degrees off but as soon as you go towards profile there ve been problems 91 41 93 besides the pose variations low resolution face images are also very hard to recognize this is one of the main obstacles of face recognition in surveillance systems 91 159 93 face recognition is less effective if facial expressions vary a big smile can render the system less effective for instance canada in 2009 allowed only neutral facial expressions in passport photos 91 160 93 there is also inconstancy in the datasets used by researchers researchers may use anywhere from several subjects to scores of subjects and a few hundred images to thousands of images it is important for researchers to make available the datasets they used to each other or have at least a standard dataset 91 161 93 facial recognition systems have been criticized for upholding and judging based on a binary gender assumption 91 162 93 91 163 93 91 164 93 91 165 93 91 166 93 91 167 93 91 168 93 91 169 93 91 170 93 when classifying the faces of cisgender individuals into male or female these systems are often very accurate 91 162 93 however were typically confused or unable to determine the gender identity of transgender and non binary people 91 162 93 gender norms are being upheld by these systems so much so that even when shown a photo of a cisgender male with long hair algorithms was split between following the gender norm of males having short hair and the masculine facial features and became confused 91 162 93 91 170 93 this accidental misgendering of people can be very harmful for those who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth by disregarding and invalidating their gender identity this is also harmful for people who do not ascribe to traditional gender norms because it invalidates their gender expression regardless of their gender identity ineffectiveness edit critics of the technology complain that the london borough of newham scheme has as of 2004 91 update 93 never recognized a single criminal despite several criminals in the system s database living in the borough and the system has been running for several years not once as far as the police know has newham s automatic face recognition system spotted a live target 91 146 93 91 171 93 this information seems to conflict with claims that the system was credited with a 34 reduction in crime hence why it was rolled out to birmingham also 91 172 93 an experiment in 2002 by the local police department in tampa florida had similarly disappointing results 91 146 93 a system at boston s logan airport was shut down in 2003 after failing to make any matches during a two year test period 91 173 93 in 2014 facebook stated that in a standardized two option facial recognition test its online system scored 97 25 accuracy compared to the human benchmark of 97 5 91 174 93 systems are often advertised as having accuracy near 100 this is misleading as the studies often use much smaller sample sizes than would be necessary for large scale applications because facial recognition is not completely accurate it creates a list of potential matches a human operator must then look through these potential matches and studies show the operators pick the correct match out of the list only about half the time this causes the issue of targeting the wrong suspect 91 88 93 91 175 93 controversies edit privacy violations edit civil rights organizations and privacy campaigners such as the electronic frontier foundation big brother watch and the aclu express concern that privacy is being compromised by the use of surveillance technologies 91 176 93 91 82 93 91 177 93 face recognition can be used not just to identify an individual but also to unearth other personal data associated with an individual such as other photos featuring the individual blog posts social media profiles internet behavior and travel patterns 91 178 93 concerns have been raised over who would have access to the knowledge of one s whereabouts and people with them at any given time 91 179 93 moreover individuals have limited ability to avoid or thwart face recognition tracking unless they hide their faces this fundamentally changes the dynamic of day to day privacy by enabling any marketer government agency or random stranger to secretly collect the identities and associated personal information of any individual captured by the face recognition system 91 178 93 consumers may not understand or be aware of what their data is being used for which denies them the ability to consent to how their personal information gets shared 91 179 93 in july 2015 the united states government accountability office conducted a report to the ranking member subcommittee on privacy technology and the law committee on the judiciary u s senate the report discussed facial recognition technology s commercial uses privacy issues and the applicable federal law it states that previously issues concerning facial recognition technology were discussed and represent the need for updating the privacy laws of the united states so that federal law continually matches the impact of advanced technologies the report noted that some industry government and private organizations were in the process of developing or have developed voluntary privacy guidelines these guidelines varied between the stakeholders but their overall aim was to gain consent and inform citizens of the intended use of facial recognition technology according to the report the voluntary privacy guidelines helped to counteract the privacy concerns that arise when citizens are unaware of how their personal data gets put to use 91 179 93 in 2016 russian company ntechlab caused a privacy scandal in the international media when it launched the findface face recognition system with the promise that russian users could take photos of strangers in the street and link them to a social media profile on the social media platform vkontakte vt 91 180 93 in december 2017 facebook rolled out a new feature that notifies a user when someone uploads a photo that includes what facebook thinks is their face even if they are not tagged facebook has attempted to frame the new functionality in a positive light amidst prior backlashes 91 181 93 facebook s head of privacy rob sherman addressed this new feature as one that gives people more control over their photos online we ve thought about this as a really empowering feature he says there may be photos that exist that you don t know about 91 182 93 facebook s deepface has become the subject of several class action lawsuits under the biometric information privacy act with claims alleging that facebook is collecting and storing face recognition data of its users without obtaining informed consent in direct violation of the 2008 biometric information privacy act bipa 91 183 93 the most recent case was dismissed in january 2016 because the court lacked jurisdiction 91 184 93 in the us surveillance companies such as clearview ai are relying on the first amendment to the united states constitution to data scrape user accounts on social media platforms for data that can be used in the development of facial recognition systems 91 185 93 in 2019 the financial times first reported that facial recognition software was in use in the king s cross area of london 91 186 93 the development around london s king s cross mainline station includes shops offices google s uk hq and part of st martin s college according to the uk information commissioner s office scanning people s faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives in order to identify them is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all 91 187 93 91 188 93 the uk information commissioner elizabeth denham launched an investigation into the use of the king s cross facial recognition system operated by the company argent in september 2019 it was announced by argent that facial recognition software would no longer be used at king s cross argent claimed that the software had been deployed between may 2016 and march 2018 on two cameras covering a pedestrian street running through the centre of the development 91 189 93 in october 2019 a report by the deputy london mayor sophie linden revealed that in a secret deal the metropolitan police had passed photos of seven people to argent for use in their king s cross facial recognition system 91 190 93 automated facial recognition was trialled by the south wales police on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019 the use of the technology was challenged in court by a private individual edward bridges with support from the charity liberty case known as r bridges v chief constable south wales police the case was heard in the court of appeal and a judgement was given in august 2020 91 191 93 the case argued that the use of facial recognition was a privacy violation on the basis that there was insufficient legal framework or proportionality in the use of facial recognition and that its use was in violation of the data protection acts 1998 and 2018 the case was decided in favour of bridges and did not award damages the case was settled via a declaration of wrongdoing 91 191 93 in response to the case the british government has repeatedly attempted to pass a bill regulating the use of facial recognition in public spaces the proposed bills have attempted to appoint a commissioner with the ability to regulate facial recognition use by government services in a similar manner to the commissioner for cctv such a bill has yet to come into force correct as of september 2021 91 116 93 imperfect technology in law enforcement edit as of 2018 91 update 93 it is still contested as to whether or not facial recognition technology works less accurately on people of color 91 192 93 one study by joy buolamwini mit media lab and timnit gebru microsoft research found that the error rate for gender recognition for women of color within three commercial facial recognition systems ranged from 23 8 to 36 whereas for lighter skinned men it was between 0 0 and 1 6 overall accuracy rates for identifying men 91 9 were higher than for women 79 4 and none of the systems accommodated a non binary understanding of gender 91 193 93 it also showed that the datasets used to train commercial facial recognition models were unrepresentative of the broader population and skewed toward lighter skinned males however another study showed that several commercial facial recognition software sold to law enforcement offices around the country had a lower false non match rate for black people than for white people 91 194 93 experts fear that face recognition systems may actually be hurting citizens the police claims they are trying to protect 91 195 93 it is considered an imperfect biometric and in a study conducted by georgetown university researcher clare garvie she concluded that there s no consensus in the scientific community that it provides a positive identification of somebody 91 196 93 it is believed that with such large margins of error in this technology both legal advocates and facial recognition software companies say that the technology should only supply a portion of the case no evidence that can lead to an arrest of an individual 91 196 93 the lack of regulations holding facial recognition technology companies to requirements of racially biased testing can be a significant flaw in the adoption of use in law enforcement cyberextruder a company that markets itself to law enforcement said that they had not performed testing or research on bias in their software cyberextruder did note that some skin colors are more difficult for the software to recognize with current limitations of the technology just as individuals with very dark skin are hard to identify with high significance via facial recognition individuals with very pale skin are the same said blake senftner a senior software engineer at cyberextruder 91 196 93 the united states national institute of standards and technology nist carried out extensive testing of frt system 1 1 verification 91 197 93 and 1 many identification 91 197 93 it also tested for the differing accuracy of frt across different demographic groups the independent study concluded at present no frt system has 100 accuracy 91 198 93 data protection edit in 2010 peru passed the law for personal data protection which defines biometric information that can be used to identify an individual as sensitive data in 2012 colombia passed a comprehensive data protection law which defines biometric data as senstivite information 91 131 93 according to article 9 1 of the eu s 2016 general data protection regulation gdpr the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person is sensitive and the facial recognition data processed in this way becomes sensitive personal data in response to the gdpr passing into the law of eu member states eu based researchers voiced concern that if they were required under the gdpr to obtain individual s consent for the processing of their facial recognition data a face database on the scale of megaface could never be established again 91 199 93 in september 2019 the swedish data protection authority dpa issued its first ever financial penalty for a violation of the eu s general data protection regulation gdpr against a school that was using the technology to replace time consuming roll calls during class the dpa found that the school illegally obtained the biometric data of its students without completing an impact assessment in addition the school did not make the dpa aware of the pilot scheme a 200 000 sek fine 19 000 21 000 was issued 91 200 93 in the united states of america several u s states have passed laws to protect the privacy of biometric data examples include the illinois biometric information privacy act bipa and the california consumer privacy act ccpa 91 201 93 in march 2020 california residents filed a class action against clearview ai alleging that the company had illegally collected biometric data online and with the help of face recognition technology built up a database of biometric data which was sold to companies and police forces at the time clearview ai already faced two lawsuits under bipa 91 202 93 and an investigation by the privacy commissioner of canada for compliance with the personal information protection and electronic documents act pipeda 91 203 93 bans on the use of facial recognition technology edit in may 2019 san francisco california became the first major united states city to ban the use of facial recognition software for police and other local government agencies usage 91 204 93 san francisco supervisor aaron peskin introduced regulations that will require agencies to gain approval from the san francisco board of supervisors to purchase surveillance technology 91 205 93 the regulations also require that agencies publicly disclose the intended use for new surveillance technology 91 205 93 in june 2019 somerville massachusetts became the first city on the east coast to ban face surveillance software for government use 91 206 93 specifically in police investigations and municipal surveillance 91 207 93 in july 2019 oakland california banned the usage of facial recognition technology by city departments 91 208 93 the american civil liberties union aclu has campaigned across the united states for transparency in surveillance technology 91 207 93 and has supported both san francisco and somerville s ban on facial recognition software the aclu works to challenge the secrecy and surveillance with this technology 91 citation needed 93 91 209 93 in january 2020 the european union suggested but then quickly scrapped a proposed moratorium on facial recognition in public spaces 91 210 93 91 211 93 during the george floyd protests use of facial recognition by city government was banned in boston massachusetts 91 212 93 as of june 10 2020 municipal use has been banned in 91 7 93 berkeley california oakland california boston massachusetts june 30 2020 91 213 93 brookline massachusetts cambridge massachusetts northampton massachusetts springfield massachusetts somerville massachusetts portland oregon september 2020 91 214 93 the west lafayette indiana city council passed an ordinance banning facial recognition surveillance technology 91 215 93 on october 27 2020 22 human rights groups called upon the university of miami to ban facial recognition technology this came after the students accused the school of using the software to identify student protesters the allegations were however denied by the university 91 216 93 the european reclaim your face coalition launched in october 2020 the coalition calls for a ban on facial recognition and launched a european citizens initiative in february 2021 more than 60 organizations call on the european commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric surveillance technologies 91 217 93 a state police reform law in massachusetts will take effect in july 2021 a ban passed by the legislature was rejected by governor charlie baker 91 218 93 instead the law requires a judicial warrant limit the personnel who can perform the search record data about how the technology is used and create a commission to make recommendations about future regulations 91 219 93 emotion recognition edit in the 18th and 19th century the belief that facial expressions revealed the moral worth or true inner state of a human was widespread and physiognomy was a respected science in the western world from the early 19th century onwards photography was used in the physiognomic analysis of facial features and facial expression to detect insanity and dementia 91 220 93 in the 1960s and 1970s the study of human emotions and its expressions was reinvented by psychologists who tried to define a normal range of emotional responses to events 91 221 93 the research on automated emotion recognition has since the 1970s focused on facial expressions and speech which are regarded as the two most important ways in which humans communicate emotions to other humans in the 1970s the facial action coding system facs categorization for the physical expression of emotions was established 91 222 93 its developer paul ekman maintains that there are six emotions that are universal to all human beings and that these can be coded in facial expressions 91 223 93 research into automatic emotion specific expression recognition has in the past decades focused on frontal view images of human faces 91 224 93 in 2016 facial feature emotion recognition algorithms were among the new technologies alongside high definition cctv high resolution 3d face recognition and iris recognition that found their way out of university research labs 91 225 93 in 2016 facebook acquired faciometrics a facial feature emotion recognition corporate spin off by carnegie mellon university in the same year apple inc acquired the facial feature emotion recognition start up emotient 91 226 93 by the end of 2016 commercial vendors of facial recognition systems offered to integrate and deploy emotion recognition algorithms for facial features 91 227 93 the mit s media lab spin off affectiva 91 228 93 by late 2019 offered a facial expression emotion detection product that can recognize emotions in humans while driving 91 226 93 anti facial recognition systems edit the development of anti facial recognition technology is effectively an arms race between privacy researchers and big data companies big data companies increasingly use convolutional ai technology to create ever more advanced facial recognition models solutions to block facial recognition may not work on newer software or on different types of facial recognition models one popular cited example of facial recognition blocking is the cvdazzle makeup and haircut system but the creators note on their website that it has been outdated for quite some time as it was designed to combat a particular facial recognition algorithm and may not work 91 229 93 another example is the emergence of facial recognition that can identify people wearing facemasks and sunglasses especially after the covid 19 pandemic 91 230 93 given that big data companies have much more funding than privacy researchers it is very difficult for anti facial recognition systems to keep up there is also no guarantee that obfuscation techniques that were used for images taken in the past and stored such as masks or software obfuscation would protect users from facial recognition analysis of those images by future technology 91 231 93 in january 2013 japanese researchers from the national institute of informatics created privacy visor glasses that use nearly infrared light to make the face underneath it unrecognizable to face recognition software that use infrared 91 232 93 the latest version uses a titanium frame light reflective material and a mask which uses angles and patterns to disrupt facial recognition technology through both absorbing and bouncing back light sources 91 233 93 91 234 93 91 235 93 91 236 93 however these methods are used to prevent infrared facial recognition and would not work on ai facial recognition of plain images some projects use adversarial machine learning to come up with new printed patterns that confuse existing face recognition software 91 237 93 one method that may work to protect from facial recognition systems are specific haircuts and make up patterns that prevent the used algorithms to detect a face known as computer vision dazzle 91 229 93 incidentally the makeup styles popular with juggalos may also protect against facial recognition 91 238 93 facial masks that are worn to protect from contagious viruses can reduce the accuracy of facial recognition systems a 2020 nist study tested popular one to one matching systems and found a failure rate between five and fifty percent on masked individuals the verge speculated that the accuracy rate of mass surveillance systems which were not included in the study would be even less accurate than the accuracy of one to one matching systems 91 239 93 the facial recognition of apple pay can work through many barriers including heavy makeup thick beards and even sunglasses but fails with masks 91 240 93 however facial recognition of masked faces is increasingly getting more reliable another solution is the application of obfuscation to images that may fool facial recognition systems while still appearing normal to a human user these
