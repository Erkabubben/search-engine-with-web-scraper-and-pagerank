sought to establish a school to train native americans as christian missionaries it was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the american revolution wheelock s ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with mohegan indian samson occom occom became an ordained minister after studying under wheelock from 1743 to 1747 and later moved to long island to preach to the montauks 91 25 93 wheelock founded moor s indian charity school in 1755 91 26 93 the charity school proved somewhat successful but additional funding was necessary to continue school s operations and wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money the first major donation to the school was given by john phillips in 1762 who would go on to found phillips exeter academy occom accompanied by the reverend nathaniel whitaker traveled to england in 1766 to raise money from churches with these funds they established a trust to help wheelock 91 25 93 the head of the trust was a methodist named william legge 2nd earl of dartmouth the charter of dartmouth college on display in baker memorial library the charter was signed on december 13 1769 on behalf of george iii although the fund provided wheelock ample financial support for the charity school wheelock initially had trouble recruiting indians to the institution primarily because its location was far from tribal territories in seeking to expand the school into a college wheelock relocated it to hanover in the province of new hampshire the move from connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter the royal governor of new hampshire john wentworth provided the land upon which dartmouth would be built and on december 13 1769 issued a royal charter in the name of king george iii establishing the college that charter created a college for the education and instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading writing amp all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing amp christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences and also of english youth and any others the reference to educating native american youth was included to connect dartmouth to the charity school and enable the use of the charity school s unspent trust funds named for william legge 2nd earl of

required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas 91 198 93 the college s founder eleazar wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the society for the propagation of the gospel a missionary society founded in london in 1701 in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education 91 212 93 engraved by a boston silversmith the seal was ready by commencement of 1773 the trustees officially accepted the seal on august 25 1773 describing it as an oval circumscribed by a line

by canadian artist and designer thoreau macdonald that design was used widely and like dwiggins seal had its date changed from 1770 to 1769 around 1958 91 212 93 that version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others 91 217 93 college designer john scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s but it did not see the success of macdonald s design 91 218 93 the shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the geisel school of medicine and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across 91 219 93 the

objectives of the college in advancing native american education 91 224 93 some alumni and students as well as the conservative student newspaper the dartmouth review have sought to return the indian symbol to prominence 91 225 93 but never succeeded in doing so 91 226 93 various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot but none has become official one proposal devised by the
